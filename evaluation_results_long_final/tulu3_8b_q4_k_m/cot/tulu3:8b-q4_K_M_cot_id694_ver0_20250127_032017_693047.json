He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 7 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
