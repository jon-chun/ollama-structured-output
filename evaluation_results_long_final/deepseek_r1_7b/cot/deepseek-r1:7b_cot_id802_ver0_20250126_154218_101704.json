    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history but it's not a conviction\u2014just an arrest. That might be low or medium risk because he hasn't yet been convicted, so maybe he can turn things around. But I'm not sure how much that affects the overall risk compared to other factors.\n\nHe's 19, which is still relatively young, and considering he's only had two jobs in a year, his employment history might be low or medium. Without steady work, it could be harder to maintain sobriety or financial stability after incarceration.\n\nHis race is White, but I don't think that directly affects recidivism risk unless there are systemic issues, which aren't likely here since he's just one individual. So maybe no direct impact on the risk factors.\n\nHe lives alone and hasn't been married\u2014no family support to help him get back on track. That might be a medium factor because having family can provide encouragement and resources when released.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college, so he might not have the skills needed for future employment or education, which could affect his ability to reintegrate successfully after incarceration\u2014maybe that's medium risk.\n\nDrug use history is significant. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can impair judgment and decision-making during re-arrest situations, making him a high-risk factor because it's a relapse waiting to happen.\n\nHis early life was tough\u2014he lived with both parents at age 5 but in a household of five in an urban area. That environment could have had a lot of stressors and issues, which might contribute to higher risk factors like anxiety or substance use\u2014high risk due to the challenging upbringing.\n\nHe believes in God and sees it as unrelated to his personal events, so he's likely detached from any support system that could help him stay on track. That disconnection makes him a high-risk factor because he doesn't have internal motivation for change.\n\nPutting all these together: Medium to high factors like drug use, challenging home environment, lack of family support, and recent negative emotions push the risk higher. The confidence is around 85% as there are multiple strong indicators pointing towards a higher likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History (Arrest but No Conviction)\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one criminal arrest which may indicate potential for future offenses, but since it's not a conviction, it doesn't fully establish a clear recidivism risk yet.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year suggests some ability to provide for oneself, which might help in reintegrating successfully after incarceration.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone and Not Married\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and not being married may limit family support and social networks that could aid in re-arrest recovery efforts.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (High School Diploma)\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma but not currently enrolled in college may present challenges in gaining necessary skills for future employment or education.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana and Cocaine)\", \"high\", \"A history of drug use, especially in the past four years, along with feelings of low mood recent to drug use, significantly increases the risk of relapse which can lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Challenging Early Life Experience\", \"high\", \"Living with both parents in a household of five in an urban area at a young age suggests exposure to stressors that may have negatively impacted his mental health and substance use patterns throughout his life.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God and Disconnection from Support Systems\", \"high\", \"Considering that the individual sees God as unrelated to personal events, this likely indicates a lack of spiritual or emotional support which can be crucial for recovery efforts.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
