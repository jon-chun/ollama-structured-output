He's White, has one arrest but no conviction, is 5'9\", not married, living alone, without a high school diploma, worked one job, hasn't used drugs in four years, had a tough childhood with four siblings in a rural area, and doesn't feel depressed.\n\nFirst, his lack of education\u2014no HS diploma or GED. Studies show that educational barriers can lead to unstable employment and family situations, increasing recidivism risk. So, that's high.\n\nHe was once arrested but not convicted. Incivility often leads to more involvement with the system if he gets caught again. Medium risk here.\n\nNo drug use in four years; that's a positive sign. Low risk factor.\n\nStress factors: living alone and not feeling depressed\u2014could mean less emotional support, which might contribute to substance abuse or other issues. Medium risk because while it's a stressor, it's mitigated by his lack of drug use and depression symptoms.\n\nChildhood circumstances are bad\u2014he was in a household of four with his dad in a rural area. Such environments can lead to strained relationships and higher crime rates. High risk here.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God for personal issues\u2014might relate to substance abuse or neglect, which are linked to recidivism. Medium because it's not directly tied but could influence behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: education is a strong negative (high), past arrest slightly increases risk (medium), living situation is high, and other factors are medium. So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"No HS diploma/GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can lead to unstable employment and family situations, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Past non-convicted arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest may signal higher involvement with the criminal system if reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without emotional support could contribute to substance abuse or other issues.\"),\n    (\"Household of 4 in rural area at young age\", \"high\", \"Childhood experiences in challenging environments can lead to strained relationships and increased crime risk.\"),\n    (\"Does not feel depressed\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years and no current depression symptoms mitigate risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
