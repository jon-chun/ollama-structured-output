    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which immediately raises a red flag because prior convictions are a strong indicator of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis age is still young at 19, but that doesn't necessarily mean he won't make mistakes again. Young adults often enter the workforce or society with less life experience, so that could contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's never married and living alone\u2014maybe he's going through something personal that isn't being openly acknowledged. Being single can sometimes be an indicator of instability or lack of support, which might push him towards criminal behavior.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is concerning because education plays a significant role in reducing recidivism. Without proper education, he might not have the skills needed for successful employment and long-term stability.\n\nHe's held two jobs, but since he's only 19, that's pretty early in his career. Maybe he's taking on multiple responsibilities or working part-time, which could be risky if those roles lead to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nNot using drugs in the past four years is a positive sign; drug use is often linked to criminal behavior and poor decision-making. His lack of recent drug use might indicate a change in mindset or responsibility towards his future.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is interesting. While depression can sometimes be a motivator for criminal acts, not feeling it now suggests he's mentally stable enough to handle his responsibilities without becoming unstable again.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five at a young age indicates he might have experienced a lot of stress or neglect, which could contribute to behavioral issues later on. This environment doesn't provide him with the stability that many recidivists need to avoid criminal behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014prior convictions, lack of education, living situation, and past drug use\u2014the risk assessment suggests a high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of two prior arrests and convictions which is a significant indicator of potential future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age and Early Work Experience\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old with only two jobs held, indicating limited life experience that may correlate with higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Currently living alone at 19, which could indicate instability or lack of support systems contributing to potential criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lacks a high school diploma and GED, which can impede future stability and employability, increasing risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Has not used drugs in the past four years, which may indicate recent positive changes in substance use behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
