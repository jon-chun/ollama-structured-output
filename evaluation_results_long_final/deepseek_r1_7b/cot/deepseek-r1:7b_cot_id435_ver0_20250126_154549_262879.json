He's been arrested nine times and convicted once, which is a solid indicator of past criminal behavior. His age might mean he's still developing skills, especially since he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. That could affect his ability to find stable employment.\n\nHe's living alone without any jobs for the past year, so job training and support systems are probably lacking. Not using drugs in the past four years is positive, but he hasn't felt depressed recently either. However, his early life was tough\u2014he lived with his biological mother in a household of 14 in an urban area. That extreme poverty could have long-term effects on his behavior.\n\nHe identifies as God-involved, which might suggest some spirituality or moral guidance, possibly reducing recidivism. But considering all factors, especially his extensive criminal history and unstable living situation, I'm leaning towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with nine arrests and one conviction, indicating past problematic behavior which could predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age and Educational Background\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, the individual may still be developing essential life skills such as education and employment, which are critical for reducing recidivism risk.
