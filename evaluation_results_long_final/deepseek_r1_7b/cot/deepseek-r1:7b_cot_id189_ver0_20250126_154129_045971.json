    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 19-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested twice but not convicted, which might indicate past mistakes that could predict future ones. His height and weight probably aren't factors here since he's already got a high school diploma without college enrollment.\n\nHe's married living with his spouse, so social support is likely good. No job experience could mean he's not actively seeking help or opportunities, which might contribute to recidivism. Using marijuana in the past four years shows drug use history; that's a risk factor because substance abuse can lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nLiving in a household of six from a young age suggests he was raised in an environment without much supervision, maybe leading to unstable family dynamics or poor decision-making as an adult. His belief in God might indicate a lack of strong personal accountability towards his actions, which could correlate with higher risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014arrest history, substance use, unstable upbringing\u2014the likelihood of rearrest seems high. I'd assign the primary risk factor 'high' based on the combination of past criminal behavior and other contributing factors.\n</think>\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Arrest History:** The individual has a history of two arrests but no convictions, indicating prior misdeeds which could predict future criminal behavior.\n\n2. **Drug Use:** Past use of marijuana may correlate with higher risk of substance abuse issues, potentially influencing future substance-related criminal incidents.\n\n3. **Upbringing:** Growing up in a household of six from a young age suggests possible neglect or unstable family dynamics, contributing to risky decision-making later on.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe combination of these factors points towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of two arrests but no convictions, indicating prior criminal behavior that could predict future criminality.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana may correlate with higher risk of substance abuse issues, potentially influencing future incidents involving drugs or alcohol.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban area with six household members from a young age suggests possible neglect or unstable family dynamics, contributing to risky decision-making later on.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse.
