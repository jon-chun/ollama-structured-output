I'm not sure how that plays into recidivism risk, but generally, race can influence outcomes based on systemic issues, so maybe it's a medium factor.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a significant red flag\u2014revious convictions increase recidivism risk, so this is probably high.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to reoffending, but they might not be factors either.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support network, which might increase risk, but it's not as direct as other factors. Maybe medium.\n\nNo marital status\u2014since he's never married. Some studies suggest that being single can lead to higher recidivism due to substance use and lack of supervision, so maybe medium or high.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment\u2014he's educated, which might reduce risk if he's motivated, but maybe low.\n\nTwo job placements during the year\u2014not a lot of employment history, could be a red flag if he struggled before. Maybe low.\n\nDrug use in past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014substance abuse is a big risk factor for recidivism. High weight here.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently\u2014he doesn't mention it. If he was depressed before, that might have contributed to substance use, so maybe slightly medium or low.\n\nYoung age with four-parent household\u2014it's a stable environment initially but as he grows older, dependency on parents decreases. Maybe no direct impact unless there were disciplinary issues in the past.\n\nBelieves in God\u2014religion can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to lack of control over substance use, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting this all together: High risk due to prior arrest and drug use. The job placements are minimal but not directly bad. Substance abuse is a strong indicator, which tips it towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Previous conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years raises the risk of engaging in similar behavior again.\"),\n    (\" employment status\", \"low\", \"Two job placements may indicate some ability to support oneself, but it's a minor factor compared to other indicators.\"),\n    (\" family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with parents at a young age might suggest past stability, which is less concerning than other risk factors like substance use or previous convictions.\"),\n    (\" mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently doesn't directly correlate with prior behavior but could mitigate some negative effects of substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
