    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger adults generally have a lower recidivism rate because they're more likely in their prime years and haven't had as much life experience to lead them astray. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there are disparities in the criminal justice system based on race, so being White might be associated with higher rearrest rates compared to other racial groups. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has been arrested 3 times and convicted. Multiple convictions are a strong indicator of recidivism because they show she's had trouble staying out of trouble before. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHer height is 5'3\" and weight between 175-199 lbs, which seems within a normal range for her age. Weight isn't typically a direct correlate unless there are underlying health issues or chronic substance use, but she's not mentioned having that yet. So I'll consider this low.\n\nShe's never married and currently not living alone. Not being in a stable relationship or living situation can affect her behavior and ability to reintegrate into society successfully. This might be a medium risk factor.\n\nLack of a high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational barriers can lead to substance abuse, lack of skills, and unstable employment. This is another medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held 2 jobs in the past year. Having some work experience is positive as it shows ability to support herself, but only two jobs might be insufficient for stability or providing enough resources. Medium risk here.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with recent drug use in the past month when she felt down. Substance abuse can increase recidivism rates because of impulsive behaviors and potential triggers. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe feels down often and may be seeking comfort substances to cope, which could lead to more substance-related issues or other risky behaviors. High risk.\n\nYoung age and living with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Family factors can influence behavior; being raised in a household with multiple people might have both protective and negative influences. Medium risk here.\n\nConsidering God as something that affects her personally suggests she may seek spiritual guidance for issues, which could be positive but not directly linked to higher recidivism unless there are other negatives like neglect or abuse.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors include multiple arrests, drug use, recent emotional distress, and maybe the White identifier. Medium factors are age, living situation, education, job stability. Low factors are height and no current issues with living arrangements.\n\nI'd estimate a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger adults generally have lower recidivism rates due to their prime years and life experience.\"),\n    (\"Race (White)\", \"medium\", \"Criminal justice disparities based on race may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate past trouble, increasing future risk.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Normal range; no evidence of underlying health issues or substance use affecting stability.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can affect integration into society and support network.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education and absence from college may hinder self-sufficiency.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs might be insufficient for long-term stability or resourcefulness.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past use, especially recent, can lead to impulsive behaviors and triggers for substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress/Recent Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Frequent mood swings and drug use may increase risk of further issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Household size and urban area could have both protective and negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Seeking spiritual guidance is positive unless other negatives like neglect are present.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
