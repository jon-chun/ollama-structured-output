    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her criminal history: she has one arrest but no conviction. That might be a low risk because there's nothing on her record yet, but it's something to consider.\n\nAge is 21, which is relatively young, so maybe less recidivism? But it also depends on how much time she spends in the system and elsewhere.\n\nShe identifies as White. I remember that racial factors can influence recidivism rates, often having a low impact compared to other factors like substance use or prior criminal history.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'5\" and 135 lbs. Not sure if that affects risk directly, but maybe related to health issues which could be another factor.\n\nLiving alone: she's not married and living alone. Some studies suggest living in single occupancy might reduce risk compared to cohabiting or being with family, but it can also depend on support systems.\n\nEducation: high school diploma but enrolled in college. Higher education is generally protective against recidivism, so that's a good sign.\n\nNo job during the year: maybe she's looking for work or not actively employed. Employment is usually a positive indicator as it provides stability and reduces stress, which could contribute to substance use.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to instability or other issues, but since she's not feeling depressed now, maybe that mitigates some risk.\n\nYoung age at home: lived with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Urban living might offer more opportunities and stressors which could contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nReligious belief: considers God has something to do with her life. Religious involvement is generally protective as it can provide moral guidance and support, reducing risk factors.\n\nPutting this all together, the low factors are her education and living situation. Medium factors include her age, drug use history, and past home environment. High isn't present, but maybe she's at medium due to some risk points from the past four years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"Her single arrest without a conviction may indicate low recidivism risk compared to individuals with more serious or multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"While 21 is considered young, time spent in incarceration and substance use could increase risk over the next three years.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Racial background typically has a minor influence on recidivism rates compared to other factors such as substance abuse or lack of education.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes reduce risk if she has support from family or community, but it also increases isolation and potential stressors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Her high school diploma and college enrollment are strong protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Joblessness\", \"medium\", \"Lack of employment could contribute to increased stress and substance use, which may influence rearrest risk over three years.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"While she has a history of drug use, her lack of recent depression may indicate reduced risk associated with drug-related stress or trauma.\"),\n    (\"Urban Homelessness in Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a household size of two could expose her to various stressors that might influence substance use and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"high\", \"Her consideration of God as part of her life may provide moral support, which is protective against recidivism.
