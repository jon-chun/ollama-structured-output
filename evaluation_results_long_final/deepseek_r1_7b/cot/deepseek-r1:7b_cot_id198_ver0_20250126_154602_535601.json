    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old male. Let me break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two arrests and one conviction. That's a solid red flag because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher chances of reoffending. So that factor is definitely high risk.\n\nHis race is White, but I don't think that plays into it here since we're looking at factors related to his behavior, not demographics. So maybe no impact on the risk assessment beyond what's already given.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs 145 lbs. That doesn't seem directly relevant to recidivism unless there are health issues, but he hasn't felt depressed recently, so probably not a problem here.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Being in a stable environment generally reduces risk, but if he has support from friends or family, it's less concerning. Since he's 22 and young, maybe not as much of an issue, but still neutral.\n\nHe has a Bachelor's degree and is college-bound. Education can be a mitigating factor because higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and financial stability. So that might lower his risk slightly, maybe medium.\n\nHe held only one job in the past year. That could be a red flag because unemployment for so long might indicate underlying issues or perhaps he's not actively seeking work. If he had stable employment history before, this could be worse, but since it's just one job, maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse problems, which can lead to other criminal behaviors or increase risk of relapse. So that's high risk because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's positive; if he were feeling down, it might affect his behavior. But since he's stable, maybe not a significant factor here.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four. His family background could influence his behavior and decision-making. If the family was supportive, it might be less concerning, but if there were issues, it could add to the risk factors. Since no specific issues are mentioned, maybe neutral or low.\n\nLastly, he believes in God's influence on his life. Religious beliefs can affect behavior, but without knowing specifics, it's hard to gauge. If it's a strong belief with support from family and friends, it might mitigate some risks; otherwise, it could be neutral. So probably medium.\n\nPutting it all together: The two prior arrests are high risk factors. Drug use is another high one. The job and living situation don't add much. Education mitigates but isn't enough to bring it down. So overall, the risk assessment points towards a high chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the structured response:\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- **Prior Arrests (High)**: Two arrests indicate a history of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\n- **Drug Use (High)**: Recent drug use can lead to substance abuse issues, which often correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\n**Supporting Factors:**\n- **Education and Employment**: Higher education and current employment may offer stability, mitigating risk but not eliminating it entirely.\n- **Family Background**: Living in a supportive household of four doesn't indicate significant family dysfunction, keeping this factor low to medium.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe presence of high-risk factors like prior arrests and drug use significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest. Despite mitigating factors such as education and employment, the overall risk assessment is high due to these critical indicators.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests indicate a history of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can lead to substance abuse issues, which often correlate with higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
