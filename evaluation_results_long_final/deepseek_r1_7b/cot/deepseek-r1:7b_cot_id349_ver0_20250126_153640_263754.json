    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White, but I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues in the system affecting him specifically, which isn't mentioned. So maybe no impact on weight.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one prior arrest and a conviction. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that would be high weight.\n\nHis age is 22; younger individuals might have more time to learn or change, but recidivism rates can still be higher in this age group compared to older adults who may be more settled.\n\nHe's 6ft 0in and weighs 212 lbs. Taller and heavier people are sometimes considered a risk due to potential substance use issues like marijuana, which he has used in the past four years. However, since his recent mental health hasn't been depressed, maybe that mitigates some of that.\n\nHe's living alone, so noone to look out for him as much as if he were with family or friends. But living arrangements can vary widely in supportiveness.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in college suggests some level of education but also indicates maybe less employability unless he has a specific skill. Not working during the year might contribute to dependency issues, which could increase risk.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) is a red flag because even if it's low-level, substance abuse can lead to other problems that may recidivate. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so maybe he's more stable now but still has past issues.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of six in an urban area. That was a stressful environment which could have long-term effects on his behavior and mental health. Urban environments can be isolating or have higher stressors.\n\nBelieving in God might provide some stability, but if he's had issues before, that belief alone doesn't negate past problems.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and living in a tough household are strong risk factors. His weight and drug use could add to the risk, while his education level is neutral unless there's associated unemployment. So I'd lean towards high risk with some mitigating factors but still likely to reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as it reflects a history of criminal behavior and potential lack of responsibility for past actions.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces some support network risks compared to living with family or friends, but it doesn't eliminate the risk of isolation or substance abuse\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use can lead to ongoing substance abuse issues which may contribute to recidivism if not addressed.
