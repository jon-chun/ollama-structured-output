    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 20-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I don't think race plays a significant role in recidivism beyond systemic factors, but since he was convicted once, maybe past convictions influence future risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a risk factor because people with less education might have fewer job opportunities or skills to avoid criminal activities.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can affect support systems. Not being married might mean he has no spouse for support, but living alone doesn't necessarily directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there are other factors like lack of supervision.\n\nNo jobs during the past year is a red flag. Unemployment often leads to increased criminal activity because people have less income and may turn to illegal activities as a result.\n\nNot using drugs in the past four years seems positive, but if he hasn't used them at all, maybe that's not directly related unless there are other drug-related issues he didn't mention.\n\nHe isn't feeling depressed over the past month. While mental health can affect recidivism, recent feelings of depression don't seem to be a major factor here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of three. A larger family at that time might have meant more supervision or different pressures, which could influence current behavior.\n\nHe believes God is involved in his life. This religious belief can sometimes provide guidance and structure, reducing the likelihood of problematic behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He has past convictions, low education, no job, living alone, no drug use, recent mental health, and a family background. His lack of support from family might increase the risk because he's relying on his own resources or perhaps lacks supervision.\n\nThe factors that point towards higher risk are his lack of education, unemployment, living situation, past convictions, and maybe the family size affecting his stability. The positive factors like no drug use and recent mental health don't offset these risks enough to lower the probability significantly.\n\nSo overall, considering all these points, I think there's a moderate to high risk he might reoffend within three years. But not extremely high because some factors are mitigating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior conviction which can indicate past behavior that may influence future actions.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma indicates lower education, which may correlate with less access to resources or opportunities for positive development.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to increased stress and reliance on personal resources rather than support systems.\"),\n    (\"no_job\", \"low\", \"Lack of employment during the past year could be a sign of instability, which may increase criminal activity as a means of survival or escape.\"),\n    (\"past_drug_use\", \"high\", \"No recent drug use might seem positive, but combined with other factors like lack of supervision, it can still pose a risk over time.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Recent lack of depression does not directly correlate to higher recidivism but could be due to personal circumstances rather than mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of three at a young age may have provided different pressures and influences compared to larger or smaller families.'),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might provide guidance, potentially reducing the likelihood of problematic behavior over time.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
