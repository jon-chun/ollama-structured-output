    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two prior arrests and a conviction. That's definitely high risk because past convictions are strong indicators of reoffending.\n\nHis weight is between 200-224 lbs at 5'11\". That might be on the higher side; maybe he's sedentary or has health issues, but I'm not sure how that affects his risk compared to others. Maybe it's medium risk?\n\nHe's living alone and never married. Being in a single-parent household can sometimes correlate with lower risk if he's stable, but without other factors, I might lean towards low.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is usually a positive factor, so lack of education would increase risk\u2014maybe medium to high?\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year and has used marijuana in the last four years. Drug use can have negative consequences on recidivism rates, especially if it's recent or frequent. That sounds like high risk.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month. A lack of mental health issues is positive, so that might temper some of the other factors\u2014maybe lowering the overall risk a bit.\n\nYoung age at 21 and previous household size of 11. Younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive or have higher recidivism rates due to maturity issues. Large households could mean he's under a lot of stress or exposed to different influences, which might affect his behavior positively or negatively\u2014I'm not sure.\n\nHe believes in God, so he has some level of support and spirituality. That's generally protective against recidivism but might not directly mitigate other risk factors like drug use or unstable living situation.\n\nPutting it all together: two prior convictions (high), weight maybe medium, living alone and single (low), no education (medium to high), recent marijuana use (high), lack of jobs (medium), no depression (positive), young age (maybe low), large household (could be mixed). \n\nI think the dominant factors here are his criminal history, education lack, and drug use. So overall risk is probably medium. But I might have missed something about how all these factors interact.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests and a conviction significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Weight Category\", \"medium\", \"His weight may suggest sedentary lifestyle or health issues, but without additional context, it's considered medium risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone and never married can sometimes indicate stability, offsetting some negative factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism, especially with recent incarceration.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and lack of mental health issues (no depression in past month) contribute to high risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"mixed\", \"Large household could mean increased stress or exposure to influences that may affect his behavior positively or negatively.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Having some level of spirituality can provide support and protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
