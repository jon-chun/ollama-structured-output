    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old with a history of being arrested once but not convicted. That might be less impactful than someone with prior convictions because at least one negative event has occurred without legal consequences.\n\nHe's 6'2\" and over 250 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a risk factor if it's leading to health issues, but since the question doesn't mention any related incidents or health problems, I might not consider this high here.\n\nHe's living alone with no children. Living alone without supervision could increase risk of substance abuse or other risky behaviors, so that's probably a medium-high risk factor.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is a positive sign; educational support can help him stay on track and avoid criminal behavior.\n\nHe has two job experiences during the year. Having some work experience might indicate responsibility, which is a mitigating factor.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Since it's marijuana (not meth or harder drugs), the risk might be lower than other drug users, so maybe medium.\n\nHe lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area. While that could provide stability, urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates which might affect his risk differently.\n\nReligious involvement: He believes God is involved in his life. Religious factors can aid in personal accountability and can be protective against recidivism if he's actively seeking help or staying within legal boundaries.\n\nNow, considering all these, the high risk factors are living alone without supervision (medium-high) because that could lead to isolation and risky behaviors. The low factors include no prior convictions, current school enrollment, job experience, religious involvement, and not using more dangerous drugs. The medium factor is his drug use history since it's not severe but still something to monitor.\n\nPutting this together, he might have a slightly higher risk because of the living situation but with several mitigating factors that could lower the overall risk.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor:\n\n1. **Living Alone Without Supervision**: Medium\n2. **Drug Use History (Marijuana)**: Low\n3. **No Prior Convictions**: Low\n4. **Current School Enrollment**: High\n5. **Two Job Experiences**: High\n6. **Living with Biological Parents in Urban Area**: Medium\n7. **Religious Involvement**: High\n\nThe prediction is that he has a low risk of rearrest, but factors like living alone and drug use should be monitored closely.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"He was arrested once without being convicted, which may have less impact than if it were a conviction.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could increase risk of risky behaviors despite not having any prior criminal history.\"),\n    (\"School Enrollment\", \"high\", \"Currently enrolled in school suggests positive engagement and potential support for avoiding criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"high\", \"Two job experiences during the year indicate some level of responsibility which can be a mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently; this may not significantly impact recidivism risk compared to other drug users.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in an urban area, which might present a mix of stability and potential exposure to urban risks.\"),\n    (\"Religious Involvement\", \"high\", \"Believes God is involved in his life, which can be protective against recidivism if he actively seeks help.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
