    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 19-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a high school diploma but hasn't completed college yet. Education can sometimes predict future success or stability, so maybe her lack of further education is a negative factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. This could indicate past issues that might affect her ability to reintegrate smoothly into society, possibly increasing risk.\n\nHer living situation: she's living alone and hasn't married. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors or instability, so that's another point towards a higher risk.\n\nShe has one job during the year. Employment is generally linked to lower recidivism rates, but maybe having only one job could limit support systems if something happens.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression symptoms are positive indicators, suggesting she's in good mental health and not using drugs, which can be significant factors against her risk of reoffending.\n\nShe was a child raised by her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in such conditions might have had both positive and negative effects; however, it's often associated with higher recidivism rates for adults due to potential trauma or socioeconomic stress.\n\nHer belief in God could be seen as a protective factor against substance abuse or criminal behavior, but it doesn't directly relate to recidivism risk. However, it's a personal factor that might influence her behavior indirectly.\n\nPutting all these together: education level is average, past arrest could be a concern, living alone adds to instability, one job isn't much support, no drug use is positive, past family environment may have issues, and religious belief doesn't directly impact recidivism. \n\nI think the factors leaning towards high risk are the lack of education, past arrest, living situation, and maybe the family background. The positive factors like employment and mental health might somewhat mitigate but not enough to reduce overall risk significantly.\n\nSo, I would lean towards a high relative weight because multiple factors point toward higher risk despite some mitigating influences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High School Diploma\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a positive factor as it indicates some level of education and stability.
