He's white, has four arrests, and a high school diploma but isn't in college. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history is significant. Four arrests and convictions are red flags\u2014higher chance of reoffending. But since he's only 20, maybe there\u2019s some leniency or potential for growth.\n\nHis age being 20 might be a consideration too; younger individuals can sometimes have more motivation to change their ways. But if he has a history, it could weigh him down.\n\nHe uses drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014but he hasn\u2019t used them in the past month. That\u2019s interesting because drug use can lead to impulsive behavior or strained relationships. Not using recently might indicate some control over his substance use now.\n\nLiving alone with no ties to a support system like family, especially since at 14 he lived with both parents in a household of four, could mean he's isolated. No one to rely on for emotional support during tough times, which can lead to increased stress and maybe criminal behavior.\n\nHe\u2019s never married but is living alone\u2014maybe he's single-parenting or trying to be independent. But if he was raised in a big family, perhaps he's not getting the same level of support now. That could contribute to him feeling lost or having no one to turn to when things go wrong.\n\nNot being enrolled in college might mean he\u2019s focused on other areas like work or street life. Without education, he might have less skills and opportunities that could lead to further crimes if he's not careful.\n\nHe\u2019s had five jobs in a year\u2014this shows he can handle different roles, but maybe it also indicates inconsistency or a lack of focus. Working multiple jobs without a clear plan might leave him vulnerable to taking up other activities like drug use or criminal behavior.\n\nHis belief in God might be affecting his motivation towards positive actions. If he doesn't see a higher power supporting him, he might not have the same drive to change his ways or seek help, making him more susceptible to negative influences.\n\nPutting it all together: His past convictions and arrests are strong indicators of potential recidivism. The factors like isolation, lack of family support at 14, drug use (even if recent), living alone, and not being in college all contribute to higher risk. While he's young, the other factors might be more influential.\n\nI think the combination points towards a high risk but maybe leaning slightly towards medium because his age could offset some of the negative factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has four arrests and convictions, which are significant indicators of past criminal behavior and potential for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Despite being 20, the recency of his criminal history could indicate a period of possible growth or change in behavior, potentially reducing risk over time.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine suggests potential for strained relationships or impulsive behavior, which can contribute to increased risk but with possible control now.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone without a support network, especially after being part of a large family at 14, may increase stress and isolation, potentially leading to criminal activity through lack of emotional support.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Not currently enrolled in college alongside working multiple jobs might indicate prioritization of work over education, reducing opportunities for positive change or deterrence\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Having held five jobs may suggest inconsistent stability or focus, which could leave him vulnerable to fluctuations that lead towards further criminal activity rather than positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God might provide some motivation for positive behavior, potentially reducing risk through faith-based accountability and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
