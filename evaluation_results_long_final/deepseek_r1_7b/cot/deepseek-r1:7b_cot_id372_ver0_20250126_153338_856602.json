    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18 but she's been arrested three times with convictions. That's a significant number of prior offenses which usually correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe's White, which can sometimes be associated with different risk factors based on societal perceptions and systemic issues, so that could be medium to high. But I'm not sure how much weight to give that without more context on her specific circumstances related to race.\n\nHer height is 5'4\" and she weighs between 150-174 lbs. Weight in this range can sometimes be associated with substance use issues, which might tie into her drug use history.\n\nShe's never married and living alone\u2014being homeless or living in poverty often correlates with higher recidivism rates because of unstable environments.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED. Not completing education is a known risk factor for reoffending due to lack of skills and increased vulnerability to exploitation or criminal opportunities.\n\nShe held only one job last year, which suggests she's not employable or has struggled to find stable work, which can lead to dependency on informal economy or other negative behaviors.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for both re-arrest and other criminal behaviors like theft or violence.\n\nShe feels so down that nothing Cheeks her up\u2014this could indicate low self-esteem, which might affect her ability to seek help or make positive choices.\n\nYoung age at 18 with past trauma from living with her biological dad in a household of four can lead to attachment issues and substance abuse. This environment often creates conditions conducive to criminal behavior.\n\nHer belief that God doesn't affect her personal life could imply lack of motivation for good behavior, which is another risk factor as she's unlikely to seek help or follow legal guidelines.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high), drug use (high), education gaps (high), unstable living situation (high). The job history and self-perception are medium. Her background and belief systems lean towards high risk factors.\n\nThe factors point strongly towards a high risk of rearrest, so I'd predict \"YES\" with 90% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Age being 18 with prior convictions increases the likelihood of reoffending as it signals past criminal behavior and potential for continued engagement in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Being White may be associated with systemic issues that could influence risk factors, though this factor alone doesn't directly point to high risk without more context about societal impacts on her personal circumstances\"),\n    (\"Weight Range\", \"medium\", \"Her weight range is within a population often linked to substance abuse issues which can contribute to higher recidivism rates.
