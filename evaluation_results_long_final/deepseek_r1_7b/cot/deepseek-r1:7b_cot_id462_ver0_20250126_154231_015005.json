    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which might indicate he's still developing socially and emotionally. Young adults can be more susceptible to negative influences early on, which could impact his behavior later.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I don't think race plays a direct role here unless there are systemic factors we're not considering. He has two arrests but no convictions. The lack of convictions might mean he's facing less severe penalties, so maybe the risk from that is low.\n\nHis height and weight fall within typical ranges for his age, nothing stands out here as either a positive or negative indicator.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, which could limit support systems. Living with family can sometimes provide stability, but living on his own might increase his exposure to negative influences.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school or going to college can limit opportunities and might lead him towards certain risky behaviors if not monitored.\n\nHe's worked two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive as it shows responsibility, but only two jobs at 19 might indicate he hasn't found long-term stability yet.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana in the past four years, which could be problematic. His recent use during the last month adds to this concern\u2014he feels low and can't find cheer, suggesting ongoing struggles with substance abuse.\n\nHis early life involved living with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That's a stable environment, but urban areas can have higher exposure to crime or negative influences, though that might be mitigated by the supportive family setting.\n\nHe believes in God, which could provide some moral guidance and resilience against negative influences, reducing risk factors related to belief systems.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest history is low because no convictions. Living alone isn't directly a risk factor here unless it's from neglect or abuse, but we don't have that info. GED and not in college are medium risks as they might limit opportunities for positive role models. Drug use, especially recent marijuana use, raises the risk significantly.\n\nThe job history is somewhat positive but doesn't outweigh other negative factors. His early life isn't directly a risk factor without more context on potential abuse or neglect.\n\nConsidering all these factors, his recidivism risk seems higher than medium because of the drug use and limited educational opportunities. The prediction would be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is 19, indicating a developing stage which may influence behavior early on.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"Two arrests without convictions may indicate less severe risks compared to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase exposure to negative influences but doesn't directly correlate with high risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"ged\", \"medium\", \"No college enrollment or GED could limit opportunities for positive role models and support networks.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is a significant risk factor indicating potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with a supportive family in an urban area may mitigate some negative influences without more context on potential issues.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide moral guidance and resilience against negative influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
