    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine the risk factors for a 20-year-old male with a Black racial identifier. He's been arrested once, convicted, and has a BMI of over 30. His living situation is solitary, he's in school, never married, and has held five jobs. Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years but only recently during low mood.\n\nHe was raised in a household of six with his biological mother in an urban area and believes in God's influence on his life.\n\nFirst, age: 20 isn't old, so maybe no significant risk from that.\nRacial factors: Black individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues but the single conviction might lower it here.\nConviction history: One time; not a lot of prior crimes, which is positive.\nBMI over 30 indicates obesity, which can be linked to higher risk factors like hypertension and diabetes. This could contribute moderately high risk.\nLiving alone increases vulnerability to stressors. His current job stability with five jobs in a year might indicate some inconsistency, but being in school suggests he's seeking better opportunities\u2014maybe reducing risk slightly.\nDrug use: Past four years, so it's not recent, which might reduce recidivism chances compared to recent use. However, the recent feelings of low mood and marijuana use could be significant stressors leading to substance abuse issues that may contribute to future offenses.\nHousehold size: Growing up in a large family with his mother could provide protective factors like emotional support but also potential neglect if not properly attended to\u2014could be conflicting here.\nBelief in God: This might reduce stress from religious trauma, which is positive for recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are BMI and living alone. Medium risks include past drug use and the current instability with five jobs. Racial and family background have a mix but not tipping towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 20 years old, which is relatively young and does not typically correlate with high recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Racial Background\", \"high\", \"Black individuals may face systemic barriers that could influence recidivism rates, though this case has only one prior conviction.\"),\n    (\"BMI\", \"medium\", \"A BMI over 30 indicates obesity, which is associated with health risks and potential substance abuse issues that can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases vulnerability to stressors and instability, which are known risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years may not directly correlate with recent recidivism but could signal potential substance abuse issues that may contribute to future offenses\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding five jobs in a year may indicate some inconsistency, though being currently enrolled in school suggests seeking better opportunities which is positive.\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Condition\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in an urban area for a young age could provide emotional support but does not directly correlate with high recidivism rates if attended to well\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may reduce stress from religious trauma, which is protective and thus reduces the risk of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
