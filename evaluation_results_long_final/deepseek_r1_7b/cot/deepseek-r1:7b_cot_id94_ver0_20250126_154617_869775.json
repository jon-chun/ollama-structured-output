    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment query for a 19-year-old Black male who has been arrested once and convicted. His factors include living alone, no job, GED, past drug use, emotional distress in the last month, early family experience with his mother, and spirituality.\n\nFirst, his criminal history is low to medium risk since it's only one offense. But since he's 19 and considering his age as a factor, maybe there's some uncertainty here.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone, which could indicate instability but doesn't immediately point to recidivism unless there are other factors like substance use or emotional issues.\n\nHis GED might be seen negatively if it suggests he didn't complete high school, so that's medium risk. Not being in college could also imply lower educational support, adding another medium factor.\n\nNo job history is a red flag; unemployment can lead to substance abuse and lack of purpose, which are high-risk factors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, especially marijuana, is concerning but not necessarily high unless it correlates with more severe behavior. His recent emotional distress might indicate stress from his background or current situation, making him a medium risk.\n\nLiving with his mother at a young age in an urban area could have both positive and negative aspects; while it's stabilizing, the urban environment might be stressful if he's facing issues there.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, each contributes to varying degrees of risk. The high factors are from drug use and emotional distress, but the majority are medium or low. \n\nPutting this all together, his overall recidivism risk is probably medium because while some issues are concerning, others mitigate it enough that a 3-year prediction wouldn't be extremely certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"The person has only one prior arrest and is convicted.

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 178 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year.
