    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black female. She has a criminal history with one arrest and conviction. Her age is quite young, which might mean she's still developing her skills. She's got some personal issues: living alone, no job, and drug use in the past four years, especially during the last month when she felt really down.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the factors. Age could be a mitigating factor since she's young, but also maybe contributing if she's still learning. The criminal history is definitely a red flag\u2014more likely to reoffend. Her living situation alone might increase stress or vulnerability. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential relapse.\n\nHer past family life with her mom in a household of four could affect her stability and support system. Considering religion plays a role, she might seek help but also face internalized issues. Her emotional state during the last month adds to the risk if drug use was a coping mechanism for stress or trauma.\n\nPutting it all together, I think each factor contributes positively to her risk. Even though she's young, her past behaviors and current situation make me lean towards high risk. Maybe around 75% confidence that she'll rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 21 may influence her development and decision-making abilities, potentially affecting her reoffending rate but also making her more susceptible to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction significantly increase the likelihood of rearrest as she may face similar pressures or circumstances that led to previous incarceration.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can isolate an individual, potentially increasing stress or vulnerability but not necessarily directly linked to criminal behavior unless other factors are present.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Heavy drug use in the past four years, especially during the last month when she felt down, suggests ongoing substance abuse which is a strong risk factor for reoffending and relapse.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of four may provide support but could also indicate underlying issues such as trauma or unstable family dynamics that might affect her behavior.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Falling into a deep mood during the last month, possibly using drugs to cope, indicates potential emotional distress which can be a significant driver for criminal behavior if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
