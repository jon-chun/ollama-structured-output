    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. She's Black, has one arrest but not a conviction, weighs 127 lbs at 5'4\", is married living with her spouse, holds a GED but isn't in college, hasn't worked during the year, hasn't used drugs in four years, hasn't felt depressed in a month, lived in a household of four with her biological mother in an urban area since a young age, and believes God influences her life.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor. Her age is 21, which isn't too concerning yet. The lack of convictions despite one arrest might mean she hasn't faced significant consequences, so maybe lower risk from that angle.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse; stability there could be a positive factor. No job experience during the year\u2014it might indicate she's in transition or perhaps not actively seeking employment, which could be a red flag if she's been unemployed for long periods.\n\nGED and no college enrollment: GED holders often have higher chances of completing high school and getting jobs, so maybe lower risk there. But if she's not working, that could affect her ability to earn a wage.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014good sign. No depression in the past month suggests mental health is stable, which is positive for re-arrest risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother since young age in an urban area: Urban environments can have different crime rates and social dynamics; not sure if that directly affects her risk but might be a neutral factor.\n\nBelieving in God\u2014religion can influence behavior, but without knowing more about her actions or life choices, it's hard to gauge. Maybe she's proactive or maybe she's just religious but not acting on it.\n\nNo past drug use and stable mental state\u2014both positive indicators for low risk.\n\nShe's not working, which could be a concern if she needs financial stability or has existing health issues that require work. But since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe she's handling her current situation well.\n\nPutting this all together: Her lack of convictions, stable living situation, positive past behavior (no drug use, no depression), and GED might suggest lower risk. However, being 21 is still early in life, but not necessarily a cause for concern unless there are other factors pushing her towards higher risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low to medium risk because most of the factors point positively. The key areas would be employment stability (she's not working) and her living situation. If she can secure job training or has support systems in place, her risk might be lower.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without Convictions\", \"low\", \"Having one arrest but no prior convictions suggests limited criminal history which typically indicates a lower risk of reoffending compared to those with prior convictions.
