    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White, which doesn't seem directly related to recidivism, but it's worth noting that some studies have found overrepresentation of minorities in the criminal justice system, so maybe there could be systemic factors at play here, but I'm not sure how much that affects individual risk. I'll tentatively assign a low weight.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and is convicted, which definitely raises his risk. Convictions are strong indicators of past behavior that might lead to reoffending. So this factor should be high weight.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; it's more about his behavioral history than physical characteristics. So I'll give them a low weight.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which could contribute to isolation and potential substance abuse issues, but again, without more info on his current situation or any stressors, this is probably a medium factor.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college might mean he has some skills that could help him find better opportunities. So maybe a lower risk from education, so low weight.\n\nHe's worked two jobs, which shows stability; working multiple jobs can indicate financial independence and responsibility, which are positive signs against reoffending. So this factor is low.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana, could be problematic. Drug use often correlates with other criminal behaviors or higher risk-taking, so this is a high factor.\n\nHis recent feelings of depression might be linked to substance abuse or mental health issues, which can increase recidivism. This seems like a medium-high risk because it's not necessarily proven but strongly suggestive.\n\nGrowing up in a household of three with his biological father in an urban area could have both pros and cons. Urban environments sometimes offer more opportunities but also might be linked to higher crime rates or unstable families, so this is probably medium.\n\nHis belief in God doesn't directly affect risk unless he's using that faith for substance abuse or neglecting responsibilities, which isn't clear here. So I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and convictions are high. Drug use and recent emotional issues could be medium-high. Everything else is low. Considering these factors collectively, the risk seems pretty significant.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the 20-year-old male, here's a structured evaluation:\n\n1. **Prior Arrests and Convictions**: High - A significant history indicates past behavior likely to repeat.\n2. **Drug Use**: Medium-High - Past use correlates with potential future issues.\n3. **Recent Emotional State**: Medium-High - Possible indicators of stress or mental health issues affecting behavior.\n\nConsidering all factors, the overall risk is high due to the presence of multiple concerning indicators despite some positive attributes like education and employment stability.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction history increases the likelihood of reoffending as past behavior can predict future actions.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium-high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse which can contribute to criminal behavior or risky decisions.\"),\n    (\"recent_emotional_state\", \"medium-high\", \"Recent feelings of depression may point towards mental health issues that could influence substance use or decision-making patterns, increasing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 130 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
