    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. She's got several factors that might influence her risk.\n\nFirst off, she has a criminal history with two prior arrests and a conviction. That seems like a significant factor on its own\u2014it points towards higher recidivism because of past mistakes in the system.\n\nHer age is 19, which isn't too old yet, but it's also not super young either. Younger people might have different motivations or circumstances that could affect her behavior, so she's definitely a risk there.\n\nShe identified as White, and while race can be a factor in certain contexts, I don't see any direct association between her race and higher rearrest rates here. So maybe this isn't the most impactful factor for her case.\n\nMarital status: she's married to her spouse. Marriage often provides stability, so that might actually lower her risk compared to someone who's unemployed or living alone. But in this case, she's not really doing much else since she has only one job and lives with her spouse, which could be a mixed signal\u2014stability but maybe also monotony.\n\nEducation-wise, she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities for positive change, so that's another red flag pointing towards higher recidivism.\n\nShe has only held one job during the year, which suggests job instability. Job loss is often a precipitating factor for recidivism because it leaves individuals vulnerable to stressors and temptations, especially if they have substance use issues.\n\nHer drug use history: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates due to relapse and potential self-harm or dangerous behavior after release.\n\nThe most concerning factor here is her recent emotional state. She's been feeling so down for most of the past month, which could mean she's struggling with mental health issues. This isn't just about substance use; untreated mental health can exacerbate substance abuse problems and lead to more risk-taking behaviors that might contribute to recidivism.\n\nHer background: at a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. That might be related to family dysfunction or other social issues which could have contributed to her current behavior. However, it's a bit unclear how this directly affects her risk unless there are patterns from that environment.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal happenstance, which might indicate she's involved in religious communities or seeking spiritual guidance. This could be a protective factor if it helps her stay stable, but without more context, it's hard to say how much of an influence this has on recidivism.\n\nPutting all these factors together: prior arrests and convictions (high), age still relatively young (medium), education issues (high), job instability (low?), marital status with a current spouse (maybe medium), substance use (high), recent emotional low (high), and family background (probably low unless there's more to it). The most significant factors here are the prior convictions, substance use, lack of education, and the recent emotional state.\n\nEach factor contributes in different ways. Prior criminal history is a strong indicator because she has two convictions. Substance use is another major factor since it can lead to other problems that might make her reoffend. Her education level being low means she's less likely to find better opportunities, which could keep her in the same cycle.\n\nConsidering all these points together, I think this person falls into a high risk category for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has two prior arrests and one conviction, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At 19, she's still relatively young, which can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates due to developmental factors or lack of life experience.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college, limiting opportunities for positive development and reduced risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Employment\", \"low\", \"Currently living with her spouse but only has one job, which might indicate some level of stability despite possible monotony or lack of engagement in other areas of life.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use History\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine, along with recent feelings of low mood, suggests potential substance abuse issues that can lead to increased risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Recent emotional low could contribute to stressors or self-harm tendencies, potentially increasing the likelihood of risky behaviors post-release.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
