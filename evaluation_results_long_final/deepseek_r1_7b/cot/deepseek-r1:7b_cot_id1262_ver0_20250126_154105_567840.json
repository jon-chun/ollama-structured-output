    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the risk of this individual rearrest within a three-year period. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: He\u2019s 21 years old, which is relatively young but still in his prime. Generally, younger individuals might have less life experience that could contribute to criminal behavior. So maybe low risk here.\n\nRace: Hispanic descent. I don't see any systemic issues or discrimination highlighted in the case, so this shouldn\u2019t be a significant factor. Probably medium risk because lack of specific info points towards no bias.\n\nConvictions: He has one arrest but not a conviction. This could indicate potential for future convictions if he re-offenses. Medium risk here since it's an unresolved arrest.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\"/168 lbs. No mention of physical issues or being overweight, so probably low risk related to substance abuse given the data provided.\n\nMarital status: Single living alone. Living arrangement can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism due to potential lack of support network. So medium here.\n\nEducation: High school diploma and not in college. Education level is usually a positive predictor for lower recidivism, so this might be low risk.\n\nJob history: Employed 2 jobs in the past year. Employment generally reduces recidivism as it provides stability. Low risk factor.\n\nDrug use: No drugs in four years. Clean drug history is a strong negative indicator. Low risk here.\n\nMental health: No depression in the past month. Positive sign, so low risk.\n\nUpbringing: Young age living with biological father in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and may influence behavior, but without more info on specific circumstances or support, it's a medium risk factor.\n\nBelief in God: Doesn\u2019t believe in God. Some studies suggest that lack of religious belief is associated with higher recidivism due to possible lower spiritual accountability. So this might be high risk.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- No drug use and clean record are strong positives.\n- Urban environment could have some negative impact, but without specific issues, maybe medium.\n- Belief in God might slightly increase risk.\n- Race doesn't heavily factor here unless there's bias, which isn't indicated.\n  \nSo overall prediction would be low to medium risk. Given the belief in God and urban living, perhaps leaning towards low? But considering other factors, maybe medium confidence.\n\nWait, but the belief in God was a high factor. So combining all, I think the overall risk is low, with some consideration for belief in God making it slightly lower.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may indicate less life experience contributing to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic descent does not inherently correlate with higher recidivism without specific systemic issues indicated.\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One unresolved arrest suggests potential for future convictions if re-offense occurs.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant physical indicators of substance abuse or health issues are present.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may correlate with higher recidivism due to potential lack of support network.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and no college enrollment indicate positive educational influences on behavior.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Employment in two jobs suggests stability and reduced likelihood of criminal activity due to financial necessity or purpose.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong negative indicator of substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported over the past month indicates positive mental health status.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological father in an urban area may correlate with higher crime rates, though no specific issues are noted.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"No belief in God could be linked to potential lower spiritual accountability and increased risk of certain behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
