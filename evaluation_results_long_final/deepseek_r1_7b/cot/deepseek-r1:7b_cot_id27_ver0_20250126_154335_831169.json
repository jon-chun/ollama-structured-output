Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White but hasn't been convicted yet. Being White doesn't directly correlate with higher or lower risk, but race can sometimes be a factor in certain contexts. However, without more info on systemic issues, I'll consider it neutral here.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Maybe having a high school equivalency might indicate some level of education that could help, but not sure how that affects recidivism.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone.\u5355\u8eab\u4e14\u72ec\u5c45\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u793e\u4f1a\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u72af\u7f6a\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\nDrug use history: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. The more recent drug use during the last month is concerning because it suggests ongoing substance abuse, which can impair judgment and increase risk of criminal behavior.\n\nShe has a violent history as a child living with four parents in an urban area. That's a high-risk factor for recidivism due to exposure to violence.\n\nHer spiritual beliefs might provide some protective factors, but if that's her primary support system, it could also be a vulnerability.\n\nPutting this all together: Drug use and past violent environment are strong indicators of higher risk. The GED is mitigating slightly, but the other factors dominate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has not been convicted\", \"low\", \"Her lack of conviction despite one arrest might suggest she has had opportunities to change her behavior or learn from past mistakes.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"She has used drugs in the past four years, with recent use during the last month indicating ongoing substance abuse which can impair judgment and increase risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (single parent household in urban area)\", \"high\", \"Living alone after a young age could reduce family support and may lead to isolation or other risk factors associated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Childhood environment (biological parents, household size 4, urban area)\", \"high\", \"Exposure to a violent environment at a young age can significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"GED certificate\", \"low\", \"Having a GED might indicate some level of education that could potentially help in reducing future recidivism.

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 139 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
