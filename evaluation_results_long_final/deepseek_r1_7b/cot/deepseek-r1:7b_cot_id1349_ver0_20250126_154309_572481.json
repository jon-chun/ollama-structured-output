    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having recidivism within three years. She's Black, has a history of 10 arrests and convictions, which is really high. Her age being 18 might mean she's younger and perhaps less experienced compared to older individuals.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and weighs 109 lbs, but I don't think physical characteristics are the main factors here; it's more about behavior and history. She's living alone, which could be a double-edged sword\u2014being alone might make her feel lonely or isolated, possibly leading to higher rates of self-harm or substance abuse. But she hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that's a positive sign.\n\nShe's never married and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. This could indicate she didn't complete school, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates because of potential lack of skills or support systems. She's worked two jobs, but without a high school diploma, it might be challenging to get better opportunities.\n\nShe grew up in a household of four with her biological mother in an urban area. That's quite a large family size, which can sometimes lead to dependency issues, especially if there's no strong support system. Her belief in God could mitigate some negative behaviors but doesn't necessarily protect against others like drug use or criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: The high number of arrests and convictions is a red flag. Age might be on the younger side, but her extensive criminal history is likely more impactful. Living alone without any family support could increase stress or isolation, which are risk factors. Lack of education and not being in school could limit opportunities to change her trajectory.\n\nHer lack of drug use and depression for the past month is positive, so maybe she's in a better mental health state, but that doesn't negate her past issues. The urban environment might offer more opportunities for crime or social influences that contribute to recidivism.\n\nI think her risk factors are significant enough to lean towards high risk. I'm not 100% confident because some mitigating factors like drug use and depression aren't present, but the overall profile points strongly towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 10 arrests and convictions, which is significantly higher than the average risk assessment for recidivism.
