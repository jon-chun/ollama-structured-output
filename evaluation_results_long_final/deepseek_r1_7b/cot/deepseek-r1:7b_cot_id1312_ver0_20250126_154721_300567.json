    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. Younger individuals might have more potential for growth or making mistakes later on, but it also depends on other factors like substance use and living circumstances.\n\nRace: he identifies as Black. Historically, Black individuals in the US have had higher arrest rates compared to White individuals, even when controlling for crime statistics. This could be a significant factor contributing to his risk.\n\nNumber of arrests: he's been arrested once but not convicted. The fact that it's an arrest rather than a conviction might indicate that the court didn't pursue charges or maybe it was a minor offense. However, even one arrest can raise concerns about underlying issues.\n\nDrug use: he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of substance abuse, which increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again. He hasn't felt depressed recently, but substance use often leads to other negative behaviors that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nLiving situation: he's living alone. Living with someone can provide support and reduce stress, but living alone means he might not have the same level of supervision or access to resources which could aid in his stability.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED. He's not enrolled in college either. Lack of education can limit opportunities for positive development and might lead to engaging in risky or criminal activities later on.\n\nJob history: he hasn't held any jobs during the year. Without a steady income, he might be more susceptible to relying on illegal activities or unstable situations that could increase his risk of reoffending.\n\nFamily background: at a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an11-person household in a rural area. This could indicate living conditions that were challenging and potentially neglectful, which can contribute to behavioral issues. However, it's also possible that he learned some resilience from this experience.\n\nReligious affiliation: he doesn't feel God has anything to do with his personal life. This might affect his decision-making regarding substance use or other risky behaviors if he perceives religion as a source of guidance or support.\n\nPutting all these together, the factors that stand out are race (Black), drug use, living alone, lack of education, and no job history. These seem to be the most significant contributors to his risk of rearrest. Even though he's young, these factors point towards a higher relative weight for each of these risk factors.\n\nConsidering all these points, I'm leaning towards a high prediction with moderate confidence because while there are mitigating factors like age and living in a rural area, the presence of multiple risk factors increases the likelihood significantly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"His age is 21, which might suggest potential for growth but could also indicate immaturity contributing to risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"He identifies as Black, and historically, Black individuals have higher arrest rates, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One non-convicted arrest raises concerns about underlying issues that might reappear.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, especially with marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation but may also reduce supervision and stability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not enrolling in college can limit opportunities and contribute to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"No job history might indicate instability, which could increase risk potential.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with an11-person household in a rural area may have had challenging conditions but doesn't directly correlate to immediate risk without neglect issues.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Not feeling God's involvement might not significantly affect his risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
