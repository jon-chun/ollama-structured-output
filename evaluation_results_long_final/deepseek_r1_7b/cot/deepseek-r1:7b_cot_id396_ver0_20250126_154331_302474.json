    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 22-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her criminal history: She has one prior arrest and is now convicted. That's a significant point because recidivism is often influenced by past convictions. So that's high risk.\n\nHer age being 22 isn't too concerning yet, but combined with the other factors, it might still influence the prediction.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there are racial disparities in recidivism, and Black individuals have higher rates than White. Since she is White, this factor alone doesn't add much risk unless we consider other variables, which she isn't.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'2\" and 145 lbs. Being underweight can be a sign of malnutrition, which might affect her ability to handle stress or maintain sobriety. That's medium risk contributing factor.\n\nNever married and living alone: Living independently is generally associated with lower recidivism because she has no one to turn to for support after a problem arises. So this doesn't add much risk.\n\nGED certificate but not in college: Some argue that having a GED can increase job opportunities, potentially reducing recidivism. However, if she's struggling with education, it might indicate other issues. This is a neutral factor.\n\nShe has three jobs during the year. Having multiple stable jobs usually helps in maintaining sobriety or financial stability, which would reduce risk. So this is low to no contribution.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana past four years but mainly feels down recently.Marijuana use isn't as severe as harder drugs and doesn't have long-term consequences like alcohol does. However, recent feelings of low mood could be related to substance use or other stressors. This might be a medium risk factor if it's leading to substance abuse.\n\nYoung age with living in a household of four: Living in a larger family can sometimes lead to more support networks but also potential issues like higher stress or dependency on others for help, which could contribute to substance abuse or instability. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nBelieves in God: Religious beliefs can influence behavior and recovery. Some people find comfort in religion, so it's not necessarily a risk factor unless there are underlying issues that lead to substance use.\n\nPutting it all together: The most significant factors are the prior conviction (high), drug use (medium), and living situation (medium). The rest of the factors don't add substantial risk. Combining these, I think her three-year recidivism is somewhat high but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use combined with feelings of low mood may indicate substance abuse issues that could lead to further behavioral problems.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living independently is generally associated with lower recidivism risk as she has no immediate support network to fall back on for emotional or practical needs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
