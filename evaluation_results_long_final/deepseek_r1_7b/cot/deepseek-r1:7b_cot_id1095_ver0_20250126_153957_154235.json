    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger adults are generally at a lower risk compared to older individuals who might have more life experiences contributing to negative behaviors. So that's probably a low or medium risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. I'm not sure if there are any specific demographic factors here, but without specific data on crime rates by race in this context, it might be neutral. Maybe medium? Or maybe low since being part of a minority often isn't directly linked to higher recidivism unless there's systemic issues.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times and convicted. Multiple prior convictions are strongly indicative of higher risk because they show a history of breaking the law, which can lead to more criminal behavior again. That should be high risk.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 185 lbs. These physical characteristics don't directly relate to recidivism risk unless there's something about his health or environment that affects it, but with no other info, I'll say low risk for this factor.\n\nHe's separated and living alone. Living in a stable home is protective, so that would be low risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college: Educational attainment can reduce recidivism. Not being enrolled might indicate instability, but since he has a diploma, maybe it's medium because sometimes lack of education can lead to other issues.\n\nNo job during the year: Unemployment or lack of income support is linked with higher risk as it may lead to turning to criminal activities for subsistence. That should be high.\n\nNo drug use in past four years and no depression in the last month. These are positive indicators, so low risk here.\n\nBorn into a household of six at an urban area: Large family sizes can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to various social or economic stressors, but it's not always directly linked. Maybe medium.\n\nDoesn't believe in God: This is more about personal belief and may influence his behavior indirectly, perhaps indicating a lack of religious guidance which could be either protective or not. Maybe low or neutral.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nMultiple prior arrests (high risk), no job (high), living alone (low), education level with diploma (medium). The rest are lower except the prior arrests. So overall prediction might lean towards high but considering some mitigating factors like living alone and education, it could be medium to low.\n\nWait, his age is 21\u2014though still young, maybe more likely to change? But recidivism studies often look at past behavior as a predictor of future. So perhaps higher risk because of prior arrests.\n\nI think the confidence would be around 70-80% since multiple high risk factors but some mitigating ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a lower risk compared to older adults who might have more life experiences contributing to negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Race (Hispanic)\", \"medium\", \"Demographic factors alone, without specific data on crime rates by race, may not directly link to higher recidivism but could be influenced by systemic issues.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests and convictions strongly indicate a history of criminal behavior which can lead to higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Stability in living environment is protective, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to lack of support or resources.\"), \n    (\"Educational Attainment (High School Diploma)\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma may reduce recidivism risk but not being enrolled could indicate other underlying issues which might increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status (Not Employed)\", \"high\", \"Lack of income and job security can lead to turning towards criminal activities for subsistence, increasing rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (None in Past Four Years)\", \"low\", \"No drug use is a positive indicator as it shows discipline and self-control which reduces the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health (No Depression in Past Month)\", \"low\", \"Lack of depression suggests mental stability, which is protective against recidivism as it may prevent impulsive or harmful behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family Background (Household of 6 in Urban Area)\", \"medium\", \"Large family sizes can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to various social or economic stressors but not always directly linked.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief (Doesn't Believe in God)\", \"low\", \"A lack of religious guidance may influence behavior indirectly, perhaps protective if it reduces societal obligations but could also be neutral.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
