    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a primary factor in most risk assessments, but it might be relevant if there are systemic issues, though that's probably low weight here.\n\nHe has one arrest without a conviction. That seems minor and not enough to have a big impact on recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'10\"/180 lbs. Not sure how that affects risk, so maybe it's low weight.\n\nNot married living alone\u2014again, probably low influence since he's an adult making his own decisions.\n\nHigh school diploma in college now\u2014he's educated, which might reduce recidivism chances, but some people drop out or face other issues later.\n\nHe held two jobs. Having job experience can be positive as it shows stability, so maybe medium weight.\n\nDrug use: past four years with marijuana and cocaine. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential future drug use, which can lead to more offenses\u2014so high risk factor here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's a good sign; mental health issues might influence substance use or other issues, but since he's not depressed now, that's medium.\n\nYoung age and foster care: lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. Foster care can sometimes lead to higher recidivism due to disrupted family environments\u2014so high risk factor.\n\nBelieves in God: That's more about his personal belief which might influence his behavior but probably low weight unless it's affecting his decisions negatively, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting this all together: Drug use (high), Foster care past (high). The rest are either neutral or lower. So the overall risk is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"His one arrest without a conviction may not significantly impact his recidivism risk, as it is a minor offense and he has no prior criminal history beyond that point.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"He has held two jobs during the year, which could indicate some stability but does not directly correlate with high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"His use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years significantly increases his risk of future substance abuse, which can contribute to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological parents in an urban area from a young age may have contributed to behavioral or family issues that could lead to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month is a positive indicator but does not directly correlate with reduced risk of recidivism compared to someone who has experienced depression.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
