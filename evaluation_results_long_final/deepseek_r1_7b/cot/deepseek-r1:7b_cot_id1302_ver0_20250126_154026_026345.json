    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22 years old. Young adults can sometimes be more resilient, but factors like living alone and recent incarceration might affect this.\n\nRace: Black is a protected class in some places, so that could influence risk assessment tools due to racial bias, which I need to consider.\n\nNumber of prior convictions: He has two. More convictions are generally associated with higher recidivism rates, especially if they're for serious crimes like drug offenses.\n\nHeight and weight: 5 feet 10 inches, between 150-174 lbs. This doesn't immediately ring any bells in terms of risk factors unless it's related to previous issues or health, which isn't indicated here.\n\nLiving situation: Living alone can increase stress and isolation, which might lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors that contribute to recidivism.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED. Lower education is linked to higher crime rates and reoffending tendencies because they may not have the skills needed for stable jobs or communities.\n\nNumber of jobs held: He's held two jobs in a year. Some job experience can be beneficial, but if he hasn't been stable or has faced difficulties, this might indicate underlying issues that could lead back into criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong risk factor for reoffending, especially if it's a recent issue.\n\nMood swings: He feels down frequently, which can contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors. Mood issues might also suggest underlying mental health concerns that could influence his decisions.\n\nEarly life experiences: Living with four people at a young age and considering God as part of his life. While this doesn't directly point to criminal behavior, it's important context for understanding his background but not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors like prior convictions, drug use, living alone, lack of education, and mood swings are all pointing towards a high risk of rearrest. Each of these contributes significantly to recidivism, especially given that he has a history of substance abuse which can lead to more impulsive or criminal decisions.\n\nI should also consider the impact of his race on the risk assessment; some tools might have inherent biases, but in this case, it's more about the individual factors. The combination of these high-risk factors makes me lean towards a high relative weight for each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"22 years old can sometimes be resilient, but factors like living alone and recent incarceration might affect this risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Black is a protected class in some places, so that could influence risk assessment tools due to racial bias, which I need to consider.\"),\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior convictions are generally associated with higher recidivism rates, especially if they're for serious crimes like drug offenses.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress and isolation, which might lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors that contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED.
