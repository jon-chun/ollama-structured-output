    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 20-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I remember that race can influence recidivism rates, but since he was convicted once, maybe it doesn't add much here unless there are systemic issues, which isn't mentioned. So probably low weight.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it might lead to better job opportunities and skills. So this factor would be low.\n\nAge 20 seems young, but he's been arrested once and convicted. Young adults often have more flexibility, so maybe medium risk? Or perhaps the recent conviction makes him a bit higher risk.\n\nHe's single living alone; no kids mentioned. Being an only child can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism because they might take better care of themselves. So low weight here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a big red flag for recidivism. It increases the likelihood of future substance abuse, which can lead to more crimes or longer prison sentences. This factor should be high.\n\nHe's never been married. Not sure how this affects, but maybe living alone could mean he's focused on himself or has different life choices. But since he's single and maybe in a relationship now, perhaps it doesn't add much weight. Maybe medium? Or low?\n\nReligious affiliation: He believes in God. Some studies suggest religious individuals might have lower recidivism rates because they may seek forgiveness or stay focused on their faith. So this could be low.\n\nPast home environment: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates and maybe stress from living with siblings. This might have an impact, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors. Maybe medium.\n\nHe feels no depression over the past month. No depression could mean he's mentally stable, which might lower recidivism risk. So this factor would be low.\n\nPutting it all together: Drug use (high), education and job (low), age (medium). The rest are either neutral or low. Since drug use is a strong indicator of potential future issues, I think the overall prediction leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"The individual's race does not significantly influence recidivism in this case as he has already been convicted and there are no systemic factors mentioned.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and current enrollment in college typically indicate better job prospects, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At 20 years old, the individual may still benefit from flexibility but his recent conviction could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine significantly increases the likelihood of future substance abuse, enhancing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not necessarily correlate with higher recidivism risk unless there are other unstable factors which are not mentioned.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may contribute to better decision-making and forgiveness, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Home Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of four in an urban area could expose him to higher stress or crime-related issues, increasing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
