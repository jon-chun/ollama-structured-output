    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of a 21-year-old female having recidivism over the next three years. She has some history with the law, being arrested twice and convicted. That's already a red flag because reoffending is more likely if someone has a criminal record.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 140 lbs, which isn't particularly relevant here unless there's something about her weight that I should consider, but since she doesn't use drugs anymore, maybe it's not an issue. Her living situation is interesting\u2014she's divorced and living alone. Being in a stable environment usually reduces risk, so this might actually be a protective factor.\n\nHer education background: no high school diploma or GED, and she hasn't enrolled in college. This could impact her ability to get stable jobs and make good life choices, which are inversely related to recidivism. Plus, not having an educational support network might affect her decision-making.\n\nShe didn't work during the year, so unemployment is a risk factor because people who don't have income often turn to illegal activities when stressed or in tough economic times. Her recent drug use history is clean for four years, which is positive, but that's from two months ago, so maybe she hasn't been using recently.\n\nHer mood this month: feeling down and couldn't find anything to cheer her up suggests she might be dealing with stress or low self-esteem. This could affect her ability to form positive relationships and make decisions that lead to reoffending.\n\nBiographically, at a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That's a bit concerning because living in such environments can sometimes correlate with more challenging family dynamics or lack of support, which might influence her behavior as she gets older.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her personal events adds a positive aspect; spirituality often correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this could be a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history is high risk. Education and employment are low or medium factors depending on the context. Living alone might be protective but her current stressors could be a risk. Her mood isn't directly tied to recidivism unless she's using that as a motivator, which she hasn't in recent months.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think her overall risk is high because of her past convictions and circumstances that might not protect her from reoffending.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **High Criminal History:** The individual has two prior arrests and a conviction, significantly increasing the risk of recidivism.\n\n2. **Education Levels:** Lack of education (no diploma or GED) may hinder future employability, negatively impacting her ability to make positive choices.\n\n3. **Employment Status:** Not working during the year could lead to increased stress or dependency on illegal activities when under strain.\n\n4. **Mood and Stress:** Current emotional state suggests potential stress or low self-esteem, which might affect decision-making.\n\n5. **Living Situation:** Living alone may offer some protective factors, but her recent mood issues are concerning.\n\n6. **Biographical Factors:** Past home environment (household of four in urban area) could have negative family dynamics, potentially influencing behavior.\n\n7. **Spirituality:** Positive influence from religion can lower recidivism risk, mitigating some of the above factors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe high criminal history and circumstances suggest a high risk of reoffending over three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"The individual has two prior arrests and a conviction, significantly increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education levels\", \"low\", \"Her lack of education may hinder future employability, negatively impacting her ability to make positive choices.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"low\", \"Not working during the year could lead to increased stress or dependency on illegal activities when under strain.\"),\n    (\"mood and stress\", \"medium\", \"Current emotional state suggests potential stress or low self-esteem, which might affect decision-making.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone may offer some protective factors, but her recent mood issues are concerning.\"),\n    (\"biographical factors\", \"low\", \"Past home environment (household of four in urban area) could have negative family dynamics, potentially influencing behavior.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Positive influence from religion can lower recidivism risk, mitigating some of the above factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
