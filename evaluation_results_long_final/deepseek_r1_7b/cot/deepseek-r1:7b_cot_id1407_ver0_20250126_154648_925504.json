    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine the risk factors for a 18-year-old Black female with a rearrest recidivism prediction. She's been arrested three times but not convicted. Her factors include living at home with her mother since she was young (age 10), being currently employed part-time or full-time, not using drugs, having some mental health issues in the past month, and considering God as a factor.\n\nFirst, I'll break down each risk factor:\n\n1. **Re prior ratio (RPR):** She's been arrested three times without conviction. RPR is high when there are multiple arrests regardless of convictions because it indicates a history of being stopped by authorities.\n2. **Age and Neighborhood:** At 18, she's nearing the typical age for recidivism. The urban area where she lives could have higher crime rates or poorer facilities, which might influence her behavior.\n3. **Previous Incarceration:** No prior convictions mean RPR is high as mentioned earlier.\n4. **Drug Use:** She hasn't used drugs in four years, so this factor isn't a risk here.\n5. **Mental Health Issues:** In the past month, she felt very down and couldn't find comfort. This could lead to substance abuse or self-harm, which are significant risks.\n6. **Homelessness/Living Alone:** She's been living alone since age 10 when she lived with her mother in a household of ten. Small households might not provide enough supervision, potentially leading to increased risk.\n7. **God Influence:** If she believes in God, it could either reduce or increase recidivism. Without more info, it's safer to assume it doesn't significantly influence behavior compared to others.\n\nNow, weighing each factor:\n\n- High RPR due to multiple arrests without convictions.\n- Age is a medium risk since she's relatively young but nearing the prime age for recidivism.\n- Previous living situation in a large household could be low to medium based on family support and stability.\n- Mental health issues might slightly increase risk as it can lead to behavioral issues, so perhaps medium.\n\nConsidering all factors, her overall risk of rearrest is likely high because of past arrests regardless of convictions. Her mental health issues are contributing but not the primary factor. The small household isn't a significant issue without more info on support systems.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor, here's the evaluation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Re prior ratio (RPR)\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested three times but not convicted, indicating a history of being stopped by authorities which could impact her ability to reintegrate into society without supervision.\"),\n    (\"Age and Neighborhood\", \"medium\", \"At 18 years old, she is nearing the typical age for recidivism, though factors like living in an urban area may influence her risk.\"),\n    (\"Previous Incarceration\", \"high\", \"Despite not having convictions, prior arrests can lead to higher chances of future arrests as they indicate past behavior and potential reactivity.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"She has not used any drugs in the past four years, reducing this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"medium\", \"In the past month, she has felt very down and without comfort, which could lead to substance abuse or self-harm, significantly increasing her risk.\"),\n    (\"Homelessness/Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone since age 10 in a small household may not provide enough supervision but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there is evidence of instability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 105 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 1 job during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 10, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
