    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearresting within three years. He's a Black individual with quite a few factors pointing towards high risk. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history is really significant here. He's been arrested 17 times and convicted. That's an extremely high number of convictions for someone so young. I remember reading that having multiple felony convictions can strongly predict recidivism because it shows a pattern of illegal behavior from a very early age.\n\nNext, his socioeconomic status comes into play. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Many people with limited education often find themselves in situations where they can't afford to get out of prison or improve their circumstances. This lack of education likely contributes to him seeking out more opportunities that might lead him back to criminal activity.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which might affect his stability. Living alone can sometimes mean higher stress levels and less support system, but he also mentioned feeling down and not getting much cheer from anything, so maybe it's more about personal issues than just living situation.\n\nHis drug use history is concerning too. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has been using them recently. Substance abuse can really impact someone's ability to function normally, which might make him more susceptible to making impulsive decisions or facing new challenges that could lead to further criminal behavior.\n\nThe fact that he lived with his biological mother in a household of five from a young age is alarming. Living in such a large family environment, especially in an urban area, can often lead to neglect and exposure to various negative influences. Plus, growing up in this setting might have caused him some trauma or stress that could manifest later on.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might also play a role. If he doesn't see a higher power as a deterrent, it might make him more inclined towards criminal behavior without considering the consequences. This attitude could contribute to impulsive actions or not seeking help when needed.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014multiple convictions, low education, drug use, living situation, and family background\u2014it's clear that this individual is at a very high risk of rearrest within three years. Each factor amplifies his chances of reoffending, so collectively they make the prediction quite strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"17 prior felonies\", \"high\", \"Multiple felony convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior that can predict future recidivism effectively.\"),\n    (\"No HS diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Inadequate education often correlates with low educational attainment and potential involvement in further criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana/cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse can impede cognitive function, leading to impulsive decisions and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of support from family or community may increase stress but doesn't directly correlate as strongly with recidivism as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Trauma at age from living with 5 siblings in urban area\", \"high\", \"Exposure to trauma at a young age can lead to behavioral issues and higher risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"No religious belief, feels nothing cheers him up\", \"medium\", \"Lack of spiritual support might influence decision-making but isn't as directly linked to recidivism as other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
