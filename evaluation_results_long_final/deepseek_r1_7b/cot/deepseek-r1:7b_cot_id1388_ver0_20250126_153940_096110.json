    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. She's white, has seven arrests and two convictions, which is quite a lot. Her age might be a factor since she's still young, but she's had multiple offenses.\n\nShe's 6'0\" and weighs between 175-199 lbs. Being underweight sometimes can lead to health issues that might contribute to recidivism, but I'm not sure how much that plays into it compared to other factors.\n\n living alone without a support network could increase her chances of falling back into trouble or getting involved with the criminal system again. Divorce proneness isn't mentioned, but maybe that's inferred? Not really though.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma and hasn't enrolled in college, which is a red flag because people with less education might not seek help or be as employable if they get caught again. Plus, she held only one job last year, indicating instability.\n\nHer substance use history is significant\u2014marijuana and cocaine use over the past four years, plus some recent severe mood issues. This could affect her ability to function legally or in society and might make her more prone to criminal behavior.\n\nShe experienced abuse at a young age when she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. That's a strong indicator of possible trauma which can influence her risk-taking behaviors and decision-making processes later on.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her personal events suggests she might struggle with seeking help or understanding why bad things happen, which could contribute to a higher risk.\n\nPutting all this together, each factor points towards high risk. The multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable living situation, substance use issues, and trauma from early life all compound to make her highly likely to have a rearrest in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested 7 times and convicted twice.
