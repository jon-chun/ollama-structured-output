    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 22-year-old male based on his background. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he has two arrests and a conviction. That's significant because prior convictions are strong predictors of recidivism. So that's high risk.\n\nNext, his education is a high school diploma with college enrollment. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this factor might be low or medium.\n\nHe's living alone, which can sometimes mean he's less supported and more prone to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. That's another medium risk factor.\n\nHis job situation: only one job in the past year. Unemployment for a while could indicate instability, which is also a medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years \u2013 that's positive. No depression in the past month suggests he's mentally stable, so low risk there.\n\nRegarding his early life, he lived with non-biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Exposure to such environments can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism rates due to potential neglect or stress, so medium risk.\n\nLastly, his lack of religious affiliation might not directly impact his risk but could affect social support and behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are the highest, followed by living alone and job issues. Education is a mitigating factor but not as strong. So overall, I'd say there's a high relative weight for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has two prior arrests and one conviction which significantly increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less support system, potentially increasing risk factors such as isolation or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"joblessness\", \"low\", \"Only one job in a year is not inherently bad but could be considered average compared to others with more stable employment histories.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use for the past four years indicates good sobriety which can reduce recidivism risk factors.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No depression for the past month suggests mental stability and may positively influence recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of size 4 could contribute to higher recidivism risk due to potential neglect or stress factors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"No religious affiliation does not directly correlate with recidivism but may suggest different social dynamics which are less likely to impact risk directly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
