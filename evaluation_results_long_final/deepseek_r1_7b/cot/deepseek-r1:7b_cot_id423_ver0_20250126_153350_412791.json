    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old male regarding rearrest recidivism. Let me break down each piece of information provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted. That's a solid indicator of past criminal behavior, so that should be high risk.\n\nHis age is 22, which isn't too old but considering his history, it might still pose some risk if he's not turning things around.\n\nHe uses drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can have serious consequences on recidivism rates because it often leads to more criminal behavior or increases stress, making him more likely to relapse.\n\nHe feels down for some of the past month. That could be a sign of mental health issues, which might contribute to substance abuse and thus higher risk.\n\nLiving alone at a young age with four people in his household when he was younger can sometimes lead to emotional instability or dependency issues, especially if there's no support system now.\n\nHe believes in God but doesn't see how that helps him. That might indicate a lack of faith or spirituality which could be a barrier to making positive changes.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: high risk from prior convictions, moderate from age and living situation, higher due to substance use and current mental state, and low from having some support (but only in the past). \n\nPutting it together, he seems moderately to highly at risk. Maybe leaning towards medium but with underlying high factors so maybe high overall.\n\nSo I'll assign each factor a weight: Prior Convictions - High, Drug Use - High, Current Mental State - Medium, Age - Medium, Living Alone - Low, Lack of Faith - Low.\n\nOverall prediction is YES he will be rearrested within three years with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of prior convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse in the past four years can contribute to higher rates of relapse and subsequent arrests, indicating a high risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Current Mental State\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for some of the past month may indicate underlying mental health issues that could exacerbate substance use or other negative behaviors, contributing to medium risk.\"),\n    (\"Age at Arrival in the System\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, while still relatively young, this age group often faces challenges that can lead to recidivism if not properly addressed, indicating a medium risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a support system may limit opportunities for positive change and could potentially increase risk factors like substance use or mental health issues, but this is mitigated by the presence of a biological father in the household at a young age.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"While belief in God can sometimes provide moral guidance, the individual expresses doubt about its impact on their personal well-being, which may reduce the perceived protective effect of this factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of size 4.
