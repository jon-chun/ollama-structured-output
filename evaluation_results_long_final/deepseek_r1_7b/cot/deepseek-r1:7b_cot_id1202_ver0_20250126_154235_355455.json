He's got a history of being arrested three times with prior convictions, so that's already concerning. His weight is 5'8\" and 168 lbs\u2014nothing too unusual there.\n\nHe's not married and isn't living alone right now, which might mean he's in a relationship or has someone to support him. He has a GED and is in college, so education seems positive, but he's had three jobs in the past year, indicating some instability. That could be a red flag because job loss can lead to dependency on social services.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs for four years, which is a good sign. His mood was really low recently\u2014nothing could cheer him up. That might suggest he's dealing with mental health issues or has personal problems that aren't being addressed.\n\nHis early life involved living with his biological mother in a household of two\u2014he seems to have some support there but maybe not enough. He believes in God, which is good for moral guidance, but doesn't necessarily protect him from external factors like the criminal justice system.\n\nPutting it all together: He has prior convictions, unemployment or underemployment (three jobs might be interpreted as instability), low mood indicating possible mental health issues, and a background with limited family support. These factors could increase his risk of recidivism. While he's educated and in college, which is positive, the other factors weigh more heavily. I think there's a moderate to high risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 3 prior convictions, indicating a past tendency for criminal behavior and potential difficulty in changing course.\"),\n    (\"unemployment_or_underemployment\", \"medium\", \"Holding only 3 jobs over the past year may indicate inconsistent or unstable employment, which can contribute to economic stress and possible substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"low_mood\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for extended periods can signal underlying mental health issues that may affect judgment and decision-making in social situations.\"),\n    (\"homelessness_orinstability\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a partner suggests he is not homeless but may face instability due to recent life changes or lack of support networks.\"),\n    (\"drug Abuse History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, which is a positive indicator of substance abuse prevention efforts and stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 168 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
