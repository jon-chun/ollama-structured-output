    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her race is White. I remember that being a minority can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates in some studies, but it's not always consistent. So maybe that's a low factor.\n\nShe has one arrest and no conviction, which isn't too bad. That single misdemeanor might have negative effects though. Maybe medium risk because it could still lead to issues down the line.\n\nHer height is 5'7\" and weight 155 lbs. I don't think physical attributes alone contribute much unless there's a history of substance abuse tied to weight, which isn't mentioned here. So probably low impact on recidivism.\n\nNever married living alone \u2013 that might be a red flag for social support issues or possible isolation. Maybe medium risk because it could affect her mental health and ability to seek help effectively.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree but isn't in college anymore. Education can sometimes influence job opportunities and self-esteem, but since she holds a degree, maybe this is less of a concern. So low weight here.\n\nFour jobs in the past year \u2013 inconsistent work history could be a sign of instability or perhaps substance abuse causing dropouts. Maybe medium risk because it might indicate underlying issues affecting her stability.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and felt down recently. This is a significant red flag. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential relapse, strained relationships, and higher recidivism rates. So this factor would be high weight.\n\nYoung age and living with both parents at a young age suggests she has a history of substance abuse in the family. That could increase her risk because there's a higher likelihood of using substances again. High weight here too.\n\nBelieves God doesn't affect her life \u2013 that might mean she struggles with faith-based coping mechanisms for stress or trauma, which could relate to mental health issues affecting recidivism. So another high factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use is the highest risk, followed by young age and family history. The rest are medium or low factors. So overall, there's a strong likelihood she'll have issues leading to rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the 22-year-old female, here's the breakdown:\n\n- **Race (White)**: Low - Being a White individual doesn't inherently increase recidivism risk without specific context.\n- **Misdemeanor Arrest**: Medium - A single non-convicted misdemeanor can have negative consequences but may not be as impactful as other factors.\n- **Height and Weight**: Low - No significant impact unless linked to substance abuse, which isn't indicated here.\n- **Living Alone**: Medium - Living alone can contribute to isolation, potentially affecting mental health and support networks.\n- **Bachelor's Degree**: Low - Holds a Bachelor's degree but not currently enrolled; education typically positively influences outcomes.\n- **Four Jobs**: Medium - Inconsistent job history may indicate instability linked to substance abuse or personal issues.\n- **Drug Use (Marijuana/Cocaine)**: High - Past use and current feelings of low mood suggest potential for relapse, impacting mental health and relationships.\n- **Young Age and Family History**: High - Early drug use and family environment can increase risk of further substance abuse and related issues.\n- **Religion Belief**: High - Struggles with faith-based coping mechanisms may relate to mental health challenges affecting recidivism.\n\nConsidering the high impact factors, especially drug use and family history, the prediction leans towards a higher risk. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being White doesn't inherently increase recidivism risk without specific context.\"),\n    (\"Misdemeanor Arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single non-convicted misdemeanor can have negative consequences but may not be as impactful as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant impact unless linked to substance abuse, which isn't indicated here.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can contribute to isolation, potentially affecting mental health and support networks.\"),\n    (\"Bachelor's Degree\", \"low\", \"Holds a Bachelor's degree but not currently enrolled; education typically positively influences outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Four Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Inconsistent job history may indicate instability linked to substance abuse or personal issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana/Cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Past use and current feelings of low mood suggest potential for relapse, impacting mental health and relationships.\"),\n    (\"Young Age and Family History\", \"high\", \"Early drug use and family environment can increase risk of further substance abuse and related issues.\"),\n    (\"Religion Belief\", \"high\", \"Struggles with faith-based coping mechanisms may relate to mental health challenges affecting recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
