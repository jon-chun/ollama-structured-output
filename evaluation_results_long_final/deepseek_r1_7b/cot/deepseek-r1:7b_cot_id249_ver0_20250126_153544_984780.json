    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of a 19-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let's break down all the factors given.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a prior conviction. That seems significant because past convictions are usually a red flag for recidivism. I'd say that's a high factor since having a prior conviction increases the chance of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs between 225-249 lbs, which is on the higher end but not extremely overweight. Not sure how much that affects risk, maybe more about his health or stability. Maybe no immediate impact, so I'll note it as low.\n\nNo family ties\u2014never been married, living alone. That might mean he's less likely to get support if he needs help after being released. But I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other factors like prior convictions. Maybe medium risk because isolation can lead to higher recidivism rates in some contexts.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now, which is a positive sign. Education often leads to better job opportunities and less involvement in the criminal system. So that should be low or maybe even no factor.\n\nHeld 3 jobs in the past year\u2014maybe inconsistent work? Having multiple jobs can sometimes help with financial stability but might also indicate substance use if he was unstable, which is already noted as a prior factor. Maybe medium because having some job experience isn't great but not a strong positive either.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can lead to health issues and instability, increasing the risk of reoffending. That's definitely high because substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism.\n\nNo depression felt over the past month. That's good news as previous depression could have contributed to his criminal behavior or stressors leading to it. So that factor should be low.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a multi-parent household can provide stability and support, which is protective against recidivism. That's probably medium but leaning towards lower risk because urban environments can have more stressors too.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events\u2014this might relate to his spiritual support system or belief in determinism versus free will. If he believes in a higher power influencing his decisions, it could provide some guidance and reduce risk. So maybe low impact on recidivism rates.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior conviction (high), drug use (high), no support from family or significant help like school enrollment (medium each), multiple jobs (medium). The high factors dominate here, so the overall prediction is high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"Having a prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending as it signals past behavior that may influence future decisions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly marijuana use, is strongly associated with higher rates of recidivism due to potential health complications and increased impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Multiple Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs can offer some stability but may also indicate underlying issues like substance use or financial instability which could contribute to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk unless there are extenuating circumstances such as lack of support networks which, in this case, is mitigated by school enrollment and belief in a higher power.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
