    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query from someone who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about an 18-year-old male and asked for a prediction on his rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let's break down what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I need to assign a relative weight to each of the risk factors they listed: low, medium, or high. Then, using those weights, predict whether he'll be rearrested and provide a confidence level.\n\nLooking at his background, he's 18 years old, White, arrested once but not convicted. He's tall (6'0\") and heavy (220 lbs), which might relate to substance use, but he hasn't used drugs in the past four years. No depression in the past month either, so mental health isn't a risk factor here.\n\nHe's living alone with no kids since his young age when he lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. He doesn't feel a strong religious influence on him personally. He has a high school diploma and works three jobs, which suggests stable employment but maybe not a job that would lead to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nLet me consider each factor:\n\n1. Age: 18 is typically associated with lower recidivism since he's still developing. But as an adult now, maybe some immaturity could affect him.\n2. Drug Use: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that's a good sign.\n3. Marital Status: Single and living alone. Some argue that being single can be a risk factor due to potential isolation or lack of support network, but he might have friends or family elsewhere.\n4. Education: High school diploma is positive; more education usually correlates with lower recidivism.\n5. Employment: Employed three jobs could indicate stability, which reduces the risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n6. Family History: He lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area, but since he's 18 now and living alone, maybe that's less relevant unless there are other issues not mentioned.\n7. Beliefs: No strong religious influence mentioned. Some studies suggest religion can be protective, so the absence isn't necessarily a risk.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor seems to contribute positively without any major red flags. The high school education and stable employment back him up, and the lack of drug use is a significant plus. His living situation might have changed from his youth, which could mitigate any negative family factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Age: 18 years old is typically associated with lower recidivism as individuals are still developing and transitioning into adulthood.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"He has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator of stability and reduced risk of substance abuse-related offenses.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"He is currently living alone without children, which may indicate a stable environment with less potential for risk factors like domestic violence or neglect.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which correlates with lower recidivism as individuals with higher education levels are more likely to enter the workforce and reduce opportunities for criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"He has held three jobs during the year, indicating stable employment and financial stability, which reduces the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"His family history is not strongly associated with recidivism since he lived with both parents at a young age but is now living alone, away from potential influences that could contribute to risk factors like substance abuse or instability.\"),\n    (\"Religious Influence\", \"low\", \"He does not feel a strong religious influence on his personal life, which may suggest less likelihood of behaviors influenced by religion that could contribute to recidivism\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
