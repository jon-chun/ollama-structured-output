    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk of this 19-year-old Black male who was arrested once but not convicted. He's 5'10\", weighs 185 lbs, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, currently in a job for two years, hasn't used drugs in four years, hasn't felt depressed recently. His early life involved living with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area since he was young, and he believes in God's influence on his life.\n\nFirst, let's break down each risk factor step by step. \n\n1. **Age**: He's 19, which is relatively young. While age can be a mitigating factor if he hasn't had much time to develop criminal behavior or substance use, since he has been arrested once and not convicted, his recidivism might still be low. But being so young could also mean he's just entering adulthood and may have less life experience.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years. That's a positive indicator as drug abuse is often linked to higher recidivism rates after treatment. His clean behavior suggests he's managed to stay away from substance abuse, which can be a strong mitigating factor.\n\n3. **Mental Health**: He hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health issues are significant, recent lack of depression might indicate he is currently in good mental health or actively managing his well-being. However, not feeling depressed doesn't necessarily mean he won't develop it in the future, but it's a positive sign.\n\n4. **Education Level**: He hasn't completed high school and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor as individuals without formal qualifications might have fewer opportunities for positive development or may engage in risky behaviors. However, since he's 19, this is still early in his life, and perhaps he could start working towards an education.\n\n5. **Employment**: He has held two jobs in the past year. Having some work experience can be beneficial as it shows responsibility and practical skills, which might help reduce recidivism. However, if he's not stable or isn't making progress, this could still be a risk.\n\n6. **Living Situation**: He's living alone. Living at home without support can increase stress and isolation, potentially leading to negative behaviors. But if he has friends or family nearby who support him, it might mitigate some of these risks.\n\n7. **Family History**: His early life involved living with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. This could have had both positive and negative influences\u2014being sheltered but also potentially exposed to negative environments. Urban settings can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or exposure to more risky behaviors, so this might be a mitigating factor if the environment was protective.\n\n8. **Belief in God**: He believes that God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs often provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, which can be positively associated with reduced recidivism. However, it's subjective and varies based on how he applies these beliefs.\n\nPutting all this together, the factors are mixed but lean towards lower risk due to positive indicators like clean drug use, employment, and belief in God. The negative factors\u2014age being relatively young, no education, family living situation, and limited supervision\u2014are still present but perhaps not as impactful without more context.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think his overall risk of rearrest within three years is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which is a relatively young age.
