    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 22-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history but it's not a conviction yet. That could be a red flag because even if he's been arrested once, it might indicate some underlying issues that haven't been resolved. So maybe medium risk there.\n\nHe's white. Wait, does race play a role in recidivism? I think there are disparities based on race and socioeconomic factors, but 22 is still early in his career. Maybe this factor isn't as significant yet because he's young.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; it's more about behavior and circumstances. So probably low risk from that.\n\nHe's married living with his spouse. Stability at home could reduce the likelihood of him acting out, so maybe low risk there.\n\nHigh school diploma but not college. Maybe less likely to get involved in higher education or have opportunities for betterment, which might lower risk? Or perhaps it's more about his current situation.\n\nHe has two jobs during the year. Having some income can provide stability and reduce the incentive to engage in criminal activities, so low risk from that perspective.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana past four years but felt down recently. Short-term drug use isn't a strong indicator of future behavior unless it's frequent or severe. Maybe medium risk because recent feelings might suggest potential issues, but not a clear pattern yet.\n\nYounger age and past living in a large household could mean less supervision and more exposure to negative influences, which is a higher risk factor. So high here.\n\nHis lack of faith in God might increase his impulsive behavior or defiance against authority, which are signs of higher recidivism risk. High risk from that.\n\nPutting it all together: factors like living with family, job stability, education seem positive but the past drug use and household environment are strong negatives. Since he's young, maybe the weight isn't too high yet. I'd predict a low to medium risk, leaning towards medium since some factors are pushing him up.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a criminal history with one prior arrest, which could indicate underlying issues that may affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 22 years old, the individual is relatively young, which may suggest lower long-term recidivism risk despite past behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Living with a spouse in a stable household could provide support and reduce criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma but not pursuing college might limit opportunities for positive change or deterrence.\"), \n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"low\", \"Employing two jobs during the year provides financial stability, which can decrease recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years with recent episodes of low mood could indicate potential behavioral patterns that may increase risk over time.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of six at a young age suggests possible exposure to negative influences, which can significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Not associating with God might lead to impulsive behavior or defiance against societal norms, increasing risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
