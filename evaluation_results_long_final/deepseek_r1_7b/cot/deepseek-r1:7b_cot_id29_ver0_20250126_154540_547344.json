    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this task to assess the recidivism risk of a 20-year-old female named Maria. She's Hispanic, hasn't been convicted yet but has an arrest. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Young adults can sometimes be more resilient, but factors like living alone and not being married might influence her stability. Next, she's 5'1\" and weighs between 200-224 lbs. Her weight range doesn't immediately jump out as a risk factor unless it's a sign of underlying health issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's living alone, which can be risky with isolation leading to possible drug use or other habits. She's never married and currently single, so no support network from her spouse. Her employment status is present since she's in school, but not much info on if she has a stable income elsewhere. \n\nShe's had three jobs in the past year; that might indicate some instability, which could correlate with substance use or other issues. Her drug use history includes marijuana over the past four years and recent instances of feeling down, which might suggest substance abuse affecting her mental health.\n\nHer background: at a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. That's a tough spot, high stress from living with siblings could contribute to emotional or behavioral issues. She believes in God but isn't clear on its direct impact here.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I think the risk is low because despite some negative traits like substance use and instability, she hasn't been convicted yet and might be motivated by personal factors rather than external stressors. But it's still a bit concerning.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of Maria's risk factors, including her age, living situation, employment status, drug use history, family background, and mental health indicators, the relative weight assigned to each factor is as follows:\n\n- **Age**: Low - 20 years old may be more resilient, but other factors like substance use could influence recidivism.\n- **Living Alone**: Medium - Living alone can increase stress and isolation, potentially leading to substance abuse or behavioral issues.\n- **Employment Status**: Low - Currently enrolled in school; employment status is unclear beyond her current situation.\n- **Drug Use History**: High - Past marijuana use and recent feelings of depression could correlate with substance abuse affecting mental health.\n- **Family Background**: Medium - Experiencing living with six siblings in an urban area may indicate potential stressors, though it's not directly linked to recidivism.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the risk is low. However, due to the presence of multiple concerning indicators like drug use and family stressors, the confidence level is moderate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"20 years old may be more resilient but could be influenced by substance use or other factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress and isolation, potentially leading to substance abuse or behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school; employment status is unclear beyond her current situation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use and recent feelings of depression could correlate with substance abuse affecting mental health.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing living with six siblings in an urban area may indicate potential stressors, though it's not directly linked to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area.
