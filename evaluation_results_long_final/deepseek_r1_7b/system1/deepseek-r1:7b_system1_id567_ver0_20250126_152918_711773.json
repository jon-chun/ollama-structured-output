    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this risk factor step by step. The person is an 18-year-old male, White, arrested once but not convicted. His physical stats are average height and weight, married living with his spouse. Education-wise, he lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. He has two job experiences, hasn't used drugs in the past four years, no recent depression episodes.\n\nHe's had a troubled start: at 14, lived with three family members in a rural area. Now considers God as part of his life. Despite these factors, he doesn't have any history of substance abuse or mental health issues. He's actively employed and has a stable living situation.\n\nConsidering all this, while there are some negatives like past living conditions and lack of education, the positive aspects like employment and no drug/alcohol use should temper the risk level. It seems like he's proactive and not engaging in risky behaviors. So, overall, I wouldn't label him as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
