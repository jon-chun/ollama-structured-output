    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let's break down each point one by one.\n\nFirst off, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 21 isn't that old, but considering it's his first offense or multiple offenses? He has been arrested three times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; three could be considered high risk because each arrest can lead to more supervision and probation, which sometimes results in relapse.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and he weighs 210 lbs. I'm not sure how weight relates here unless it's indicating something about his lifestyle or substance use, but he hasn't mentioned that. His current living situation is alone, so maybe less risk compared to living with others who could provide support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college now. Maybe this independence could be both positive and negative. Without an ongoing education, he might have fewer resources or opportunities for positive development.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is good because it shows he can manage money and provide for himself. It also suggests a sense of stability compared to someone not employed much.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That might indicate that he doesn't engage in heavy drug use, which could be a positive sign since heavy substance use is often linked to higher risk behaviors like theft or vandalism.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. No family support can sometimes lead to isolation, but it also means no ongoing responsibilities from an intimate partner.\n\nConsidering his past living with both parents at a young age in an urban area of a household size four could have shaped his character. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, so that's something to note. Also, being in a larger household might mean less supervision and more exposure to potential stressors like poverty or abuse.\n\nReligion: He believes God has something to do with his personal events. That can be a protective factor as religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and support during tough times.\n\nPutting it all together, the key factors that stand out are the three prior convictions. Each arrest brings its own set of risks, including supervision, community involvement, and potential for future criminal behavior. The fact that he's never married but living alone could put him at risk if he becomes involved with substance use or other risky activities.\n\nHis age is young, which might mean he's still developing problem-solving skills, but it also means the risk of recidivism decreases as he gets older. However, considering his past, three convictions in two years are concerning on their own.\n\nThe high school diploma and not being in college could be a double-edged sword; while it shows some education, if he doesn't continue learning or develop new skills, that might contribute to him seeking out more risky opportunities.\n\nHis work history is positive with two jobs, which reduces dependency issues. The lack of drug use (marijuana) and recent absence of depression also indicate a lower risk of engaging in harmful activities.\n\nThe family background could be an area for concern as urban areas often have higher crime rates, but it's mitigated by his living alone and not having a biological parent present at the time he was young. That might indicate some level of stability or resilience.\n\nOverall, while there are positive factors like employment and family absence, the most significant risk here is likely tied to the prior criminal history. Three arrests in two years suggest that he's had issues which could lead to ongoing problems if not addressed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
