    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this risk assessment indicates high risk for the individual based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male of White ethnicity. At this age, it's typical for someone to be in school and possibly entering the workforce, so that might not be a strong indicator of high risk yet.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That means there's no criminal record beyond an arrest, which usually is noted on a background check. So, maybe some concern about reoffending based on past behavior, but it's not clear-cut.\n\nHis physical attributes are 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 220 lbs. That makes him fairly tall and heavy. I know that weight can sometimes be associated with higher risk in certain contexts, like substance abuse or criminal tendencies, but without more info about his habits or past issues related to weight, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone at 19 seems a bit young, which could indicate instability or difficulty managing on his own. It might suggest he needs support but isn't directly tied to criminal risk yet.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now, so education level is good. That usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because education can lead to better job prospects and stable environments. So that's a positive sign against high risk.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Having a job, even just part-time, is generally associated with being able to support oneself and maintain a stable lifestyle, which reduces the risk of involvement in the criminal system again.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a strong indicator towards low risk since substance abuse is often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Emotional well-being is important for overall stability and ability to function without negative impacts on his behavior or relationships, which can influence criminal activity.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of three. Shared environment from a young age could have both positive and negative influences. While living with a parent might provide stability, it's not directly tied to high risk unless there were issues within that household that affected him negatively.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior but without specific evidence of problematic behavior influenced by religion, this factor doesn't strongly suggest high risk.\n\nPutting all these factors together: no prior convictions, good education, stable living situation, employment history, low drug use, recent positive emotional state, and a possible supportive environment from family. These all contribute to lower risk indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
