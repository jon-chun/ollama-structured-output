    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the given individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nShe's a 21-year-old female of White descent. Age is quite young, which might influence her ability to handle responsibilities, but that alone isn't a strong indicator. Her criminal history: one arrest and a conviction. That's a red flag because even a single conviction can affect future opportunities.\n\nHer physical characteristics are average height and weight; not sure how relevant that is here. She's unmarried and living alone, which might suggest she relies on herself or others for support, but again, context matters.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, so her education level could impact her ability to secure employment or manage substance use. Employed three jobs in a year; job stability is positive, but not directly related to risk unless there's unemployment elsewhere.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years and recent use during the last month. Frequency of drug use can affect judgment and relationships, which are indicators of risk.\n\nHer feelings that she sometimes feels down might suggest underlying issues or stressors, which could contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors if not addressed.\n\nLiving with her biological mother at a young age in an urban area\u2014family environment could influence her mental health. She mentions considering God's role in her life; this is more of a personal belief and may not directly correlate with risk unless there are issues with belief in certain systems (like religion vs. materialism).\n\nPutting it all together, the factors like past arrest, drug use, emotional distress, and family background suggest moderate to high risk. However, without knowing the specific cutoff for high risk from her context or previous assessments, I can't be 100% confident but leaning towards yes with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year.
