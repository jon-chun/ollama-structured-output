    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female of White ethnicity. Not sure how that affects risk yet, but she has only one arrest without conviction, so that might not be significant on its own. Her weight and height don't seem directly related to risk factors here.\n\nShe's divorced and living with others, which isn't necessarily bad. She has a GED and isn't in college; maybe indicating some educational focus elsewhere. She's held only one job recently, so inconsistent work history could be a factor but not sure yet.\n\nHer drug use is clean for four years, which is positive. Her mood is described as down most of the time\u2014could indicate depression or low motivation, possibly affecting her ability to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nFamily background: she lived with three people at a young age, so maybe some instability there? Also, she doesn't believe in God, which might relate to mental health issues like depression.\n\nCombining all these, while some factors like not having a conviction and clean drug use are positive, the mood state is concerning. The lack of conviction means we don't know her criminal history beyond that one arrest. Her living situation with others isn't an issue, but her self-perception about religion might correlate with other mental health issues.\n\nI'm leaning towards not high risk because she has no prior convictions and drug use history is clean, but mood could be a concern without more info on mental health support or treatment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
