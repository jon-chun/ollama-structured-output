    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this risk assessment query to analyze, and I'm supposed to determine if the given factors indicate a high risk. Let me break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being 21 isn't particularly old, so that might not be a big red flag on its own. Racial identification can sometimes play into societal perceptions, but without more context, I shouldn't assume any inherent risk there.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That's interesting because being arrested at least once could indicate some level of criminal behavior or substance use issues, as the marijuana use is mentioned. But since it's an arrest and not a conviction, maybe he's managed to avoid more serious charges. I'll have to keep that in mind.\n\nHis physical attributes are 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 205 lbs. He's described as athletic build with good proportions. Weight isn't necessarily a risk factor unless there's something else about his health, but since it's not mentioned here, maybe it's just part of the description.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a sign of instability or past challenges, which might correlate with higher risk scores if other factors support that idea. But without more info on why he's living alone, I can't make too much of it yet.\n\nHis educational background: high school diploma but enrolled in college. That shows he's committed to furthering his education, which is a positive indicator and lowers the risk compared to those with less education or no formal qualifications.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Single job might suggest some difficulty finding stable employment before, but it also could mean he's managed to get by on his own since he's 21. Stability in work can be a good sign for personal and financial well-being.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone doesn't necessarily correlate with high risk unless there's evidence of substance abuse leading to problems, like alcohol abuse or other issues. Since he's not feeling depressed now, it might indicate that any prior use was minimal or didn't have severe consequences.\n\nHe feels that God has something to do with his personal life and experiences. That could relate to spirituality or religious involvement. Some people find comfort in a higher power, but without knowing if that translates into risky behaviors, I can't link it directly to risk here.\n\nLooking at the history: living with both parents at a young age in a household of five in a rural area. That's quite an unusual situation. Younger siblings and living with multiple relatives might suggest family support or perhaps neglect, which could be associated with higher risk if other factors like substance abuse continue.\n\nHis belief that God is involved could correlate with low risk if he has a stable environment, but the past home situation raises some flags about potential instability or family dysfunction.\n\nPutting it all together: While there are some points that might suggest potential risk, like past living arrangements and possible drug use in moderation, overall factors point more towards stability. The arrest is only once, and other aspects like education, employment, and family support indicate a responsible individual with manageable issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
