    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 19-year-old female and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut. That might be relevant because there could be cultural or family factors affecting her behavior that aren't captured in general risk assessments, but I'm not sure how significant that is for predicting recidivism.\n\nShe's been arrested two times without a conviction. Having past arrests can indicate prior involvement with the system, which sometimes might correlate with higher risk, especially if she's still young and perhaps more impulsive.\n\nHer age is 19; being in this age group could mean she's just starting out, so maybe her risk is lower than someone older who has had more time to develop problematic behaviors. But she's also not very old yet, so her potential for future issues should be considered.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Being in a stable relationship can usually reduce recidivism because she has support and motivation to stay out of trouble. This might actually lower the risk rather than increase it.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. She's already showing signs of underachievement; not completing basic education could lead to other negative behaviors like drug use or unstable living situations.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness can contribute to poverty and substance abuse. Without a steady income, she might be more likely to turn to drugs or engage in risky behavior.\n\nDrug use past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential for further behavioral issues and could lead to more criminal activity if it's used as a coping mechanism.\n\nIn the past month, she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This could indicate depression or low self-esteem, which are mental health issues that can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area at a young age. Growing up in such an environment might have specific challenges like limited resources or family dysfunction that could affect her behavior later on.\n\nBelieving in God's role is positive, but sometimes religion can be tied to substance abuse or other negative behaviors if there's pressure from family or community expectations. It depends on how she views it and whether it influences her choices.\n\nPutting this all together: past arrests (two), living with a spouse (good for stability), no education (bad), one job (bad), drug use, and mental health issues. These factors seem to point towards a high risk because of the negative life circumstances she's in. She has multiple vulnerabilities that could lead to more criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\nThe individual presents several red flags such as past drug use, lack of education, unemployment, and living with her spouse, who may not provide sufficient support against her current lifestyle choices. While her age and marital status are mitigating factors, the overall risk assessment points towards a high risk due to multiple vulnerabilities.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
