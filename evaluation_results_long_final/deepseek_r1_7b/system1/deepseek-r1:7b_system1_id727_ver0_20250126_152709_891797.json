    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 19 years old. Young age often correlates with higher recidivism rates because of inexperience. His race is White; however, I'm not sure how much that affects risk without more context on the data available.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. This could be a red flag because being arrested shows he's had some contact with the system, which might indicate prior issues or willingness to engage in legal processes.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to risk unless there's a health concern mentioned elsewhere. He's 5'7\" and weighs 185 lbs\u2014nothing jumps out as problematic here.\n\nHe's living alone, single, no children. Living independently might suggest he has the resources or the support system needed to avoid further issues, but it can also be a risk factor if he lacks support networks that could help him when things go wrong.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college\u2014this indicates he's likely undereducated, which is a significant risk factor. Many individuals with lower education levels tend to have higher chances of incarceration or reoffending after release.\n\nHe has two job positions during the year\u2014he\u2019s employed, so maybe not a direct risk factor unless the jobs are unstable or not providing enough support.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be risky, especially if it's leading to other issues like mental health problems, which could affect his ability to engage positively in society.\n\nNo history of depression over the past month\u2014this is positive. People who manage their mental health well are often lower risk compared to those with ongoing issues.\n\nHe was a child raised by his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. This might suggest he has experienced homelessness or neglect, which can be high-risk factors as these environments often lead to behavioral issues and substance abuse.\n\nLastly, he believes in God\u2014he may have a strong moral compass, which could reduce risk, but it's not always consistent with all outcomes due to individual differences in faith strength and how they influence behavior.\n\nPutting this together: Low educational status is a major red flag. Being arrested once isn't necessarily a conviction, so maybe some caution there. Living alone without support might be a moderate risk if he doesn't have any network for help when needed. Drug use with no recent depression could indicate self-regulation but also potential for misuse. The urban household and past trauma could increase vulnerability to new risks.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the risk is high enough to warrant concern. So, my prediction would be YES with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
