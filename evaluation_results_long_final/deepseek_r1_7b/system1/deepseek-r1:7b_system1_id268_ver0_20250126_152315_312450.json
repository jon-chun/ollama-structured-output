    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male Hispanic. The demographic doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's important to consider how race might influence his risk profile in certain contexts. However, without specific data linking Hispanic individuals to higher risk, I'll keep this as neutral for now.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Repeated arrests are a significant indicator of criminal history, which typically correlates with higher risk of reoffending or becoming a chronic offender.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches and he weighs 190 lbs. This makes him lean towards the heavier side but doesn't directly indicate a risk factor unless combined with other metrics like BMI, which isn't provided here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be a protective factor as it reduces opportunities for substance abuse or domestic violence, but again, without more context, this is neutral.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can correlate with lower risk if he's actively seeking better opportunities, but not being educated might indicate limited resources which could increase risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Employment history suggests he's been stable enough to work multiple roles, which is usually positive for managing substance use or other personal issues. However, inconsistent job history can sometimes signal instability, so this should be considered.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is present but not severe. Marijuana use isn't typically as concerning compared to other drug types like cocaine or heroin, and since it's self-reported, the severity might be underplayed.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of recent depression could suggest he's managing his mental health well, which lowers risk. However, past depressions aren't addressed here, so that's not a positive indicator in itself.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area. Childhood living conditions can influence adult behavior and risk factors. Small households might be more rigid or controlling, which could impact his risk profile positively if the environment was protective, but without knowing specifics like family dynamics, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with lower risk if they provide a sense of purpose or moral support, but this is speculative and not directly tied to known risk factors.\n\nPutting all these together: Four prior arrests are a strong indicator of high risk. Drug use isn't severe but still contributes. The living situation might be protective, and lack of recent depression is positive. Educational status and current employment suggest he's in control enough to manage his issues without needing higher education or consistent work history.\n\nHowever, the repeated arrests are likely the most significant red flags here. Four times being arrested increases the likelihood of chronic offender behavior, which points towards high risk. The other factors don't necessarily counterbalance that, so while some mitigating factors exist, the overall assessment leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
