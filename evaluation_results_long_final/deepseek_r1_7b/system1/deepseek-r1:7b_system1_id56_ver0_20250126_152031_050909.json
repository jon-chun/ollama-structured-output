    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the given individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age is somewhat young but not necessarily a strong indicator unless there are other factors related to her age. She has been arrested three times and convicted once. That\u2019s a significant number of prior convictions, which usually indicates higher risk.\n\nShe measures 5'3\" and weighs between 175-199 lbs. Her height is on the shorter side, but weight could be concerning if it's BMI-related. She hasn't been married and isn\u2019t living alone now. Not living in a stable environment might pose some risks, though not as directly as prior convictions.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Educational gaps can lead to unstable situations, so that's another point towards higher risk.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year. Having worked before shows responsibility but also indicates possible dependency on income if there are issues with employment stability.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which could be a problem if it's frequent or severe. Also, her feelings of low mood for most of the past month might suggest underlying mental health issues, which can contribute to risk behavior.\n\nLiving at a young age with her biological mother in an urban area of size four. That's a family environment that might influence her behavior and decision-making. It could be associated with higher risk due to exposure to different influences or potential neglect.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with her personal events\u2014this suggests she may have some level of spirituality, which can sometimes correlate with lower risk if it provides guidance. However, it's not a direct indicator and might even indicate other underlying issues if she's seeking help through her faith.\n\nPutting all this together: Prior convictions (3), drug use (past 4 years), age-related living situation, lack of education, unstable living arrangements, and possibly low mood contributing to risk-taking behavior. These factors collectively point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
