    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk. The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which might mean he has a criminal history but hasn't faced the consequences yet.\n\nHe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 170 lbs \u2013 that doesn't immediately stand out to me as high risk unless there are health issues, but it's just his height and weight. He's living alone, never married, so no family support from spouse or partner. That could be a red flag because having a support system usually lowers risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college \u2013 maybe he's looking for work but hasn't found it yet. He's not employed during the year, which means no steady income to maintain current living expenses. Unemployment can lead to poverty, which is a risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years \u2013 that's positive, probably indicates good mental health or self-control. No depression over the past month \u2013 another positive sign. So these two factors are actually working against him, reducing risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a small household in a rural area. That might suggest family stability but could also mean limited exposure to a broader social environment that might offer opportunities or support. Since it's a rural area, maybe less resources for education or job prospects.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events \u2013 which suggests he's in a place of spiritual or religious well-being, possibly indicating good mental health and positive values.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a clean criminal history (not convicted), no drug use, no recent depression. His living situation is modest but perhaps not particularly stressful. He's 19, so still young, which might mean he can change direction quickly. His education level doesn't suggest he's in trouble academically.\n\nHowever, being only 19 and having a criminal arrest could be concerning because it shows he's had some involvement with the system. But since he hasn't been convicted, maybe his risk is lower than someone who has a full conviction or more serious offenses.\n\nI'm trying to weigh how these factors balance out. The negatives are low on drugs, no recent depression, clean living situation, and being Black (which might have systemic issues but this person hasn't had significant issues yet). The positives are lack of job experience, living alone (could be a risk if unstable), high school diploma.\n\nGiven all that, I'm not sure it's a high risk. He seems to have positive attributes, but there's still the potential for further issues based on his age and prior arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
