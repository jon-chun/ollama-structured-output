    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's Black and identified as such. I know there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but at this point, without more info, it might not be enough on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That means she's still on probation or maybe just a minor offense. Not much here yet.\n\nHer height is 5'4\" and weight 127 lbs \u2013 that seems within normal ranges for her age, so no indication of being underweight or anything that might cause health issues related to risk.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse \u2013 stability in a relationship can be protective rather than risk-inducing. Good sign maybe.\n\nGED certificate and not enrolled in college. She's got some educational background but isn't furthering it. Without a degree, maybe she's looking for better opportunities or is less likely to have higher-paying jobs that could lead to more stable income, which might affect her ability to support herself.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year \u2013 so she's unemployed. Unemployment can be a red flag because not having income means relying on others (like family) for support. This could increase stress and dependency, which are linked to higher risk of involvement in the criminal justice system again.\n\nNo drug use in past four years \u2013 that's positive. Drug abuse is a known risk factor when it's present but here she hasn't used any, so that's good.\n\nNo depression over past month \u2013 mental health is also important. She seems mentally stable at least recently.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at young age. That's a home environment; maybe not directly related to risk unless there were issues there, but without knowing, it might be neutral or even protective if she had supportive people around.\n\nBelieves in God \u2013 has no immediate impact on risk based on this alone.\n\nPutting it all together: She hasn't been convicted yet, so that's a low risk factor. She's not currently employed and without further education, which can limit her opportunities but also might mean she relies more on family. Her living situation with four people in an urban area could be stressors if there were issues, but we don't know. Her lack of drug use and no recent depression are positive indicators.\n\nConsidering all these factors: she's not in trouble yet, has some challenges but not indicative of high risk at this point. So maybe her overall prediction is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
