    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old male to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted. That's a clear history of criminal behavior, which usually indicates some level of risk. Arrests can signal past issues that might affect his ability to reintegrate successfully.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race is a direct indicator unless it relates to systemic issues or discrimination in the justice system. Here, no other factors suggest otherwise, so maybe not much impact on this case.\n\nHis physical characteristics are height and weight; nothing unusual there. No immediate red flags from that.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or lack of support networks, which might influence his risk level based on social connections.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is in college. Education can vary the risk factors; some people with higher education might have better job opportunities or skills to find employment.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences shows adaptability and resilience, which are positive traits that could mitigate risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014this is a good sign as substance abuse can be a significant predictor of recidivism.\n\nHe felt down for most of the past month. Emotional distress might affect his motivation or willingness to engage with support systems, but it's not immediately clear if this directly ties into criminal risk without more context.\n\nHis early life involved living with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area. A large family could provide stability but might also suggest potential issues like neglect or abuse that could affect his current risk profile.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events, which suggests he has some internal support system. Beliefs can play a role in personal behavior, though it's not directly tied to criminal risk without further information.\n\nPutting this all together: His arrest history is concerning but not the only factor. Other factors like living alone and recent emotional distress might suggest instability. However, since he has education, job experience, no drug use, and a belief system, these could temper his risk level.\n\nI'm leaning towards a \"NO\" with high confidence because while there are some negative indicators, he also has positive attributes that reduce the overall risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
