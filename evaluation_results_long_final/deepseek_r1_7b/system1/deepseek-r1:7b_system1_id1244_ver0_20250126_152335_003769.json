    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male identified as Black. Age 21 might suggest he's still developing his character and habits, which could be lower risk compared to someone older with more life experiences.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. That means he hasn't faced any significant legal consequences beyond stopping at a minor offense. This lack of prior conviction is positive, indicating he hasn't had serious issues before.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight 148 lbs. While these factors can sometimes be associated with health risks like hypertension or obesity, there's no information provided to suggest he has any underlying health issues related to his weight that could impact risk.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse. Living independently might indicate self-reliance, which is generally a protective factor against certain types of violence or recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment can be linked to lower recidivism rates if he's been actively seeking opportunities, but not being enrolled could mean he's disengaged or facing challenges that might affect his future decisions.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience is positive as it shows stability and practical skills which are less likely contributors to criminal behavior.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years suggests he's maintaining a clean lifestyle, which reduces risk factors associated with substance abuse.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Emotional well-being without recent mental health issues is another protective factor against recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting might have provided him with different social experiences and possibly some challenges that could influence his risk behavior later on.\n\nHis belief in God indicates a level of spiritual support, which can aid in personal well-being and decision-making, reducing risk factors associated with lack of religious or supportive networks.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one arrest without prior conviction, no drug use, stable living situation, positive educational background not leading to further issues, job experience, lack of recent mental health issues, and a belief in God. These all point towards lower risk.\n\nSo, I would rate this individual as low risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
