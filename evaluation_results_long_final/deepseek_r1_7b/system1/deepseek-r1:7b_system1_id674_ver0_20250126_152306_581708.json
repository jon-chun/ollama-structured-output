    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of White ethnicity. That's pretty young and from a majority ethnic background. Not sure how that affects risk immediately.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That means he has some criminal history which could indicate past behavior issues, but since it's only one conviction, maybe not too bad.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 171 lbs. No immediate info on health from these stats.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to isolation or possible lack of support network, but I don't know how significant that is in this context.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Maybe indicates some level of education, which could be associated with lower risk as opposed to dropping out, but it's just one factor.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Unemployment spells can affect someone's stability; holding a job might indicate he's employed somewhere.\n\nNo drug use in past four years and no recent depression. That's positive indicators for low risk.\n\nAt a young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of nine. High number of siblings could imply family issues or environment that might impact behavior.\n\nBelieves in God; religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different risk profiles based on cultural or belief-based support networks.\n\nPutting this all together: The person has only one prior arrest and is now convicted, which might indicate some past behavior but not a lot. He's young, so maybe he's still developing and less likely to have significant issues in the future. The lack of drug use and depression are strong positive indicators. His family background with nine siblings could be stressful, but it doesn't necessarily mean high risk unless there were specific issues related to that environment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think his risk level is low enough not to indicate a high risk. So prediction would be \"NO\" with confidence around 10%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 10\n}\n```",
