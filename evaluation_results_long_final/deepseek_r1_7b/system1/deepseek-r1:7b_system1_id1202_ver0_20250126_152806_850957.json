    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old Black male who has been arrested three times and convicted once. His height is 5'8\", weight 168 lbs, single and not living alone. He has a GED, is in college, has three jobs, no drug use in the past four years. He felt down for much of last month and lived with his mom at age 2. He believes in God.\n\nFirst, the number of prior convictions: three times. That's significant. Repeated arrest can indicate past trouble which might affect future behavior or willingness to comply with interventions.\n\nHis GED and college enrollment suggest he's trying to get an education but perhaps isn't using it effectively. Maybe he's facing barriers that are hindering his progress, which could be a risk factor if not addressed.\n\nHe has three jobs, so employment is stable. That might indicate responsibility or past success in managing resources, which can sometimes reduce recidivism risks.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs for four years and was down but maybe not actively. If he's feeling negative, it could stem from deeper issues like personal trauma or lack of support. This could be a red flag for unaddressed mental health concerns.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at age 2 suggests early abuse or neglect, which is a strong indicator of potential future behavior issues. This should significantly increase the risk assessment.\n\nBelieving in God might indicate internalized religion; however, it's less directly related to criminal behavior but could influence his coping mechanisms when things go wrong.\n\nConsidering all these factors: prior convictions (high), lack of education support (moderate), stable employment (low), drug-free past (low), trauma history (high), and religious belief (moderate). The strongest risk indicators are the prior convictions, living with an abusive mother, and the potential for unaddressed mental health issues.\n\nI think this person is at a high risk. His prior criminal history and family trauma are major red flags that outweigh other mitigating factors like employment status.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
