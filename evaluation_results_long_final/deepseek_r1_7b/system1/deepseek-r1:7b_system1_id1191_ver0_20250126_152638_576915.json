    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old Black male who's been arrested twice and convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is Black. From what I know, racial disparities in the criminal justice system are significant. Black individuals are often overrepresented in arrests and convictions even when controlling for other factors like being Black itself can be a risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice before conviction. Repeated arrest is a strong indicator of prior criminal behavior which could predict future involvement in the system again, leading to longer detentions and possibly higher risks associated with substance abuse or recidivism.\n\nHis educational background shows he only has a high school diploma and isn't pursuing college. People with less education might have fewer opportunities for positive development, leading them towards criminal activities as a means of survival or opportunity.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Being single can sometimes be a sign of instability, possibly due to family issues, which could increase stress and substance use as coping mechanisms.\n\nHe has only held one job in the past year. Joblessness often correlates with higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues because there are fewer alternatives for dealing with stress or finding solutions when not employed.\n\nHe used marijuana within the last four years. Drug use can have serious consequences, including addiction which can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and affect relationships and job prospects.\n\nIn the past month, he hasn't felt depressed. While recent emotional state isn't directly linked to future risk, chronic mental health issues are a concern. However, since he's not feeling down now, it might indicate he's managing without severe depression, but this is a gray area.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such an environment can lead to various stressors like neglect or abuse, which are known risk factors for substance abuse and criminal behavior later on.\n\nLastly, he believes in God's influence over his life. While religious beliefs can impact behavior, some evidence suggests that having strong moral support from religion might actually reduce risk if followed positively. However, this is a personal belief so it's less of an indicator.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrest convictions, educational and employment issues, family environment, substance use, and possible mental health factors all point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
