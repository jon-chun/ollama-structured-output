    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the person described. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age might not be the biggest factor here unless it's significantly below or above typical recidivism rates, but since he's quite young, maybe that's less of a concern.\n\nHe has one arrest and hasn't been convicted yet. That means he's in a clean record except for a pending charges, which could affect his future opportunities. But just one arrest might not be enough to label him as high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and weight is 180 lbs. Body type can sometimes be associated with substance use or other factors, but without more data on that, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can correlate with various issues, but again, without specific data linking these factors to risk, it's not clear.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Educational attainment often correlates with lower recidivism rates because education can lead to better job opportunities and stable lives. So having a diploma might actually be protective.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment history is usually positive for risk assessment; having work experience can show stability, which might reduce risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can be risky but might also be linked to other factors like unstable living situations or lack of support. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe he's managing those substances without significant issues.\n\nHe says that at a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. Cohabiting with strangers can lead to various challenges, potentially affecting his mental health or substance use patterns later on.\n\nHis religious affiliation is stated as believing in God affecting his personal life. Religious support systems might provide different kinds of stability compared to other households.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, living alone (though he's never married), some drug use but no recent depression, and a young age with a clean educational background and job history. These factors don't strongly indicate high risk because many are protective or neutral. The presence of an arrest is a minor concern, but without more information on the nature of that arrest or any other red flags like violent behavior or significant substance abuse beyond the past four years, it's probably not enough to label him as high risk.\n\nSo, my conclusion would be to rate this person with low confidence in high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 15\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
