    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this 19-year-old male. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 19 and from White background. Age might be a factor; younger individuals can sometimes have different motivations or circumstances compared to older ones. But alone that doesn't mean much on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because criminal history is strongly linked to future criminal behavior. The fact he's been through arrest and has a conviction might make him more prone to engage in risky behaviors again.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 3 inches, which seems tall, but I'm not sure how relevant that is here. Similarly, his weight of 165 lbs doesn't immediately raise any red flags without context on body type or health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence behavior; being single might mean he has fewer social supports or responsibilities contributing to substance use or risky decisions. But again, this needs more context to be meaningful.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower risk behaviors compared to those without formal education. However, the fact that he's still studying might indicate some motivation towards bettering himself, which could be positive or negative depending on the context.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having multiple job opportunities is generally a good sign as it can contribute to financial stability and reducing dependency on drugs or other substances. But if he's been struggling with substance use, maybe the jobs don't cover his expenses sufficiently?\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for various crimes, including theft, vandalism, or more serious offenses. The recency of the last check might matter here; if he hasn't used drugs in the past month, maybe he's trying to change his behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can be a motivator for risky behaviors like substance use or self-harm, but if he's not feeling it now, that might indicate better mental health management. However, this is just one aspect and doesn't fully capture his overall mental state.\n\nAt a young age, living with both biological parents in a household of four could have both positive and negative implications. A stable home environment can be protective, but if there are issues within the family or other stressors, it might increase risk.\n\nHe believes that God has an influence on his personal events. This religious belief can sometimes provide coping mechanisms for stress or trauma, which can be protective. However, if he's struggling with external factors, this belief could help him navigate through challenges better.\n\nPutting all these together: a criminal history is a strong indicator of high risk. His age might not directly correlate to risk unless there are other factors indicating immaturity in decision-making. The drug use and living situation do raise concerns but without more context on his current situation or support systems, it's hard to fully assess.\n\nConsidering all the points, especially the arrest and conviction history, along with the potential for ongoing substance use issues, I would lean towards a high risk level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
