    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's a 20-year-old male from Asian/Pacific Islander background. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That might show some prior trouble, but since it's not a conviction, maybe the impact isn't as severe. Then his height and weight: 5'4\" and between 125-149 lbs. I'm not sure how that relates to risk; maybe it's just personal info.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability, but without more context on living situations or issues, it's hard to say. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe not pursuing higher education could mean he's looking for easy money or something, but that might depend on other factors.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having only one job might indicate financial dependency, which can be risky if it relies too much on that single source of income. Drug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That could mean he's using them recreationally or for low-level drug-seeking without severe mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, living with eight people. That's a big household; maybe it was chaotic or stressful. Believing in God: some cultural factors might influence this person's mindset towards stressors and solutions.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, not convicted, single job, moderate drug use, living alone at 20. The negative factors don't seem overwhelming but could add up to a low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
