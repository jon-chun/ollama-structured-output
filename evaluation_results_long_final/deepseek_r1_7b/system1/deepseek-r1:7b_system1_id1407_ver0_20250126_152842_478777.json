    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old Black woman. Being Black can sometimes correlate with higher arrest rates due to systemic issues, but since she hasn't been convicted yet despite three arrests, that might not be as significant here. \n\nShe has never been married and is living alone. Living at home without a partner could indicate some level of independence or perhaps she's single because she's focused on school or career. That might lower her risk compared to someone in a relationship who might have different factors.\n\nHer height and weight: 5 feet 4 inches and 105 lbs. This is quite thin, but without knowing her BMI or other health metrics, it's hard to assess if that's a significant factor here. Maybe she's at a higher risk due to health issues related to her weight, but since she's in school now, maybe she's managing that.\n\nShe enrolled in school currently, which suggests she's focused on education and might have better job prospects, reducing recidivism risk compared to someone not studying.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having a job can provide stability and financial independence, so that's a positive indicator against high risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is excellent as substance abuse is often linked to higher recidivism rates. Also, she mentioned feeling down sometimes but nothing could cheer her up. This might indicate some mental health issues or stress, but it's important to note that she hasn't been convicted yet, so maybe she's managing these feelings without external triggers.\n\nLiving at a young age with her biological mother in a household of ten in an urban area. Large households can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to various social and economic factors, but if she's living on her own now, it might not be as significant. Urban areas can also have different risk profiles compared to rural areas.\n\nShe believes in God, which is a positive factor often associated with lower recidivism rates due to religious guidance or moral support.\n\nPutting all this together: She has some negative points like being Black and living in a large household, but she's stable, has education, no drug use, and a positive belief system. Her three arrests are not convictions, which might indicate she's been through some issues but isn't fully engaged yet.\n\nGiven these factors, I would lean towards her having a lower risk of high recidivism. However, considering the potential social factors from her past living situation, maybe there's still some residual risk. \n\nHer confidence level is around 65%, which suggests moderate confidence in her low-risk categorization but not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
