    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old male who hasn't been convicted despite two arrests. Since he's still young and his criminal history isn't significant yet, this might not be a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHis height and weight suggest he's in decent physical condition, with no apparent signs of drug use based on the provided information.\n\nHe's living alone without a family background, which is quite common among young individuals. His lack of marriage and single status don't indicate any domestic issues that could pose a risk.\n\nEducational background: He has a high school diploma but isn't pursuing further education. This might limit his opportunities but also indicates he's stable in terms of education.\n\nOccupation: He's held only one job during the year, which suggests some level of work experience and responsibility. This stability can be beneficial for reintegration into society.\n\nNo recent drug use or signs of depression are positive indicators as well. These could indicate good mental health and substance use discipline.\n\nBiodata: Growing up in a household of six with his biological parents might have shaped his early experiences, but since he's an adult now, this probably doesn't directly contribute to current risk factors unless there's evidence of ongoing issues from that time.\n\nReligious involvement shows he has personal values guiding him, which is positive and not typically linked to recidivism risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the combination doesn't strongly suggest a high risk. The key here are the low number of arrests, successful attempts, lack of drug use, good mental health, and stable living situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
