    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old female and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old Black woman with a criminal history of 10 arrests and previous convictions. That's a significant number; multiple offenses can increase the risk level because recidivism rates are higher among individuals with a history of arrest.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 0 inches, which isn't particularly concerning unless it's unusual for her population or indicative of some health issues. Similarly, her weight is 109 lbs. I don't see any obvious signs of underweight or obesity here that might relate to risk behaviors.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors, but without more context on her current situation or stressors, it's hard to gauge the direct impact.\n\nEducation-wise, she lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Not completing formal education might lead to employment challenges and could be linked to higher recidivism rates as she might not have the skills needed for better opportunities.\n\nShe has held two jobs in the past year, which is manageable but doesn't necessarily indicate low risk on its own.\n\nHer drug use history shows no recent drug use over the past four years. That's a positive indicator and could mitigate some risk factors.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which suggests she's maintaining her mental health to some extent, reducing stressors that might contribute to risk behavior.\n\nShe was raised in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of four. While living in an urban environment can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, it doesn't directly indicate personal risk unless there are other factors like exposure to violence or unstable environments.\n\nHer belief in God could be a positive motivator for her personal behavior and decision-making, potentially reducing the likelihood of risky choices.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: multiple arrests increase the risk significantly. Her education level and employment status don't present an immediate high risk but might contribute to lower recidivism if she's making good choices. However, since she has a long history of arrests, that alone should tip the prediction towards high risk despite some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
