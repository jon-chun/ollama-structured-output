    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment query step by step. First off, the person is an 18-year-old male from White background. He's been arrested three times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior offenses; convictions are strong indicators of past behavior issues.\n\nHis physical characteristics don't immediately raise red flags, but it's his living situation that catches my attention. He's single and living alone after the age of 18 is already concerning. This suggests he might be struggling with social skills or independence, which can lead to isolation and potential behavioral problems.\n\nHe's in school now, so education is a positive factor. It usually correlates with better decision-making and lower recidivism rates, but it also means he's actively working on improving himself, which I should consider when determining his risk level.\n\nHis job history is minimal\u2014holding one job past year\u2014but that could indicate instability or difficulty finding consistent work, which might contribute to substance abuse issues. Plus, considering his use of marijuana in the past four years, even just once, can be a red flag for drug-related problems.\n\nThe mention that he felt so down during the past month and nothing could cheer him up points towards possible depression or low self-esteem. These mental health issues often go hand in hand with substance abuse and could lead to more serious risk behaviors if not addressed.\n\nHis background living with his biological mother at a young age, especially in a household of four in an urban area, might indicate family dynamics that contribute to his current issues. Urban environments can sometimes have higher stress levels due to various community issues, which might influence his behavior.\n\nAdditionally, he believes in God's role in his life. While belief systems are subjective and not directly measurable, it's something to consider when assessing his willingness or ability to make positive choices independently.\n\nPutting all these factors together: prior convictions, living alone at a young age, potential mental health issues, drug use, and possibly unstable family dynamics all contribute to a higher risk of reoffending. The person is likely to have underlying issues that could exacerbate any existing behavior problems once released from incarceration.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
