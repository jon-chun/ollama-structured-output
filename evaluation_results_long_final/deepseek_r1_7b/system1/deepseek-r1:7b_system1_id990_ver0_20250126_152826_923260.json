    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm supposed to act as a risk assessment expert and analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old female to determine if she's at high risk. \n\nFirst, I'll go through each factor one by one.\n\nShe's White, which isn't inherently a risk factor unless there are historical data showing White individuals have higher recidivism rates, but without specific info, I should keep it neutral for now.\n\nAge 18: Being an adult doesn't directly indicate high risk, but age itself is not a direct risk indicator. She hasn't been convicted yet, only arrested once, so that's not a conviction-based offense which might be more concerning.\n\nHeight and weight are within typical ranges; nothing jumps out as abnormal here.\n\nSingle living situation: Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to lack of supervision, but it also depends on other factors like support systems.\n\nShe's in school, which usually indicates she's actively trying to improve her circumstances. Unemployment is often a bigger concern than being employed while studying.\n\nNo criminal history yet, just an arrest. No convictions mean she hasn't faced significant legal consequences before.\n\nEmployed part-time at least once: She's working, so that might suggest stability compared to someone unemployed or looking for work.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine): Drug use can have both short-term and long-term effects on behavior. Recidivism studies show drug use is a risk factor, but not everyone who uses drugs ends up reoffending.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month: Depression can be a sign of mental health issues that might affect her risk. However, it's also possible she's managing well without needing support.\n\nBiological family living together at a young age with a household size of 4: Sharing a house with multiple siblings could provide some support but might also mean she's in an environment where she feels less responsible for herself, which can be risky if she doesn't have other support.\n\nBelieving God has nothing to do with her personal life: This indicates strong atheism or lack of religious belief. Some studies suggest people who don't affiliate with religion may face different risk factors compared to those who do, but without data on how that affects recidivism, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some indicators like drug use and family living situation, none stand out as strongly concerning. She has a clean record, is in school, employed, and living independently. Her positive mental health status also helps. So I think she might not be at high risk, but I shouldn't rule anything out entirely without more data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
