    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk and then respond with a JSON object containing \"prediction\" as YES or NO and \"confidence\" as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, looking at the person's age: she's 21. Young adults are often considered less likely to commit serious crimes because they're still developing their decision-making skills. However, it's important to consider other factors beyond age alone.\n\nShe identifies as White, which might indicate some underlying issues related to systemic inequalities in the criminal justice system, but without more information on race-specific risk factors, this isn't immediately decisive.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Re-arrests can be a sign of instability or ongoing problems with the legal system, but again, it's about the nature of these arrests and whether they indicate a pattern of behavior beyond just being in custody.\n\nHeight is 5'2\" and she weighs 160 lbs. This doesn't immediately raise red flags unless combined with other factors like body type that might suggest health issues or substance use, but there's no information here about her weight relative to her height or any related health problems.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence mental health; living alone at a young age without family support might contribute to isolation and substance abuse, which are risk factors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, indicating some level of education but also showing that she's actively working towards betterment, which might mitigate certain risks if she's applying her skills positively.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. Job experience can be positive as it shows stability and life skills, but it doesn't directly indicate risk unless there were issues with those jobs or substance use affecting work performance.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. This is a significant red flag because drug use, especially crack cocaine, has been linked to higher rates of criminal behavior such as theft, violence, and street involvement. Her recent use (last month) indicates ongoing issues which can increase risk.\n\nEmotional state: She's feeling down most of the time, so much so that nothing cheers her up. Persistent negative emotions can lead to substance abuse, depression, or self-harm, all of which are precursors to more serious criminal behavior.\n\nEarly life: At a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of four in a rural area. Experiencing abuse or neglect early on is a strong indicator of high-risk behavior later in life. Living in an unstable environment can strain mental health and coping mechanisms, increasing the likelihood of substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nBelief in God: She doesn't see any role for God in her personal life. This might indicate a lack of guidance during tough times, which could contribute to substance use or risky behaviors as she may not have a supportive spiritual network to turn to for comfort or problem-solving.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors that stand out are her drug use (past four years, recent), emotional state (persistent sadness), early life experiences in an unstable household, and lack of religious support. These are strong indicators of high risk. Despite some mitigating factors like being White and having a diploma, the dominant risk factors point towards a high risk prediction.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high confidence level because most of these risk factors are significant and not easily reversible. The user is 21, which might suggest she's still developing, but her arrest history, substance use, emotional struggles, and early life conditions significantly raise the bar.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
