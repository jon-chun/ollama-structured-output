    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 18 years old, which is young, so that might be a mitigating factor. He identifies as White, but race doesn't typically directly correlate with criminal tendencies unless in specific contexts, but I don't have enough info to consider that significant here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's one prior offense; some people commit new offenses after being released from the first, so maybe that's a sign of potential risk again.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight between 150-174 lbs. That places him around an average to below-average weight for his height, which might indicate he could be at higher risk if he's sedentary or has health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which can increase stress and substance use, so that's a possible red flag.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school, which is good because education often leads to better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having employment can be beneficial as it provides stability and financial independence.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse is linked to behavioral problems and health issues, which can contribute to higher risk if not addressed.\n\nMood: During the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This might indicate depression or a low mood, which can affect self-control and decision-making.\n\nAt a young age (18), lived in a household of four. Living with multiple family members can sometimes correlate with higher delinquency rates due to shared environment factors, but it's not always the case.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could relate to religion or spirituality, which might influence behavior; however, without specific evidence, this is a minor factor.\n\nPutting all together: He has a history of arrest, which can increase risk if he re-offenses. His drug use and mood issues are concerning. Living in a big household at a young age may contribute to risky behavior. However, his educational status and employment might mitigate some factors. The prior arrest is significant but not definitive without knowing if it's related to violent crimes or other offenses.\n\nConsidering all these, I'd lean towards high risk with 65% confidence because while there are mitigating factors like education and current job, the presence of a prior arrest, substance abuse, mood issues, and family background at a young age suggest he may pose significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
