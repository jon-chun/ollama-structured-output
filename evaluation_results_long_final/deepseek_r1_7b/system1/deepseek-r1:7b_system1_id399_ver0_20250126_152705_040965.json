    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates high risk for someone based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, 19 isn't too old yet, but being an adolescent might mean he's still developing socially and emotionally. Being White doesn't immediately stand out to me as high risk unless there are specific stereotypes involved, which I don't think are directly applicable here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a key point because an arrest can show that the individual has some criminal tendencies or maybe was in trouble before. However, since he hasn't been convicted, it might mean he's managed to avoid longer prison sentences or at least hasn't shown violent behavior yet.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight between 125-149 lbs. That seems within a normal range for his age, so no immediate association with high risk there. Maybe if he was significantly overweight, but in this case, it's just around the average.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of being somewhat independent or possibly experiencing some issues that might affect his mental health. But without more context on what's causing him to live alone, it's hard to say if that's a risk factor.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education level is an important factor because generally, higher education can lead to better job opportunities and stability. Being without a degree might indicate he's struggling with academics or perhaps not motivated enough, which could lead to other problems like unemployment.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Single job experience doesn't necessarily mean low risk; in fact, having some work experience can show responsibility and maturity. However, if that job was unstable or he's looking for another, it might be a sign of instability.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone isn't always a red flag unless there are other negative behaviors like significant drug-related issues or if he's been involved in substance abuse treatment. Since he hasn't felt depressed, maybe it's not severe enough to be considered high risk.\n\nHe was part of a household of five at an early age. Living with multiple siblings might suggest family issues or social pressures, which could potentially impact his behavior and mental health. However, again, without knowing the dynamics within that household, it's hard to gauge how much of an issue that is.\n\nHis religious belief in God affects him personally. This can be a protective factor as religious beliefs often provide support and guidance. It might also show he has personal values that could influence his behavior positively, but it doesn't necessarily predict criminal behavior unless there are other issues at play.\n\nPutting this all together: There's one prior arrest without a conviction, which is a risk because even if it's not leading to longer sentences, recidivism can happen. He's in a job, so maybe he has some income, but being undereducated could lead him into trouble. His living situation alone might be stable or not, depending on other factors.\n\nI think the high risk here would depend more on whether he's meeting certain thresholds for recidivism. Without specific metrics like re-arrest rates or other risk indicators, it's a bit tricky. However, considering his one prior arrest and limited education, these could be moderate to high risk factors.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with a confidence of around 65%. It's not extremely high but there are some indicators that point toward higher risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 5. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
