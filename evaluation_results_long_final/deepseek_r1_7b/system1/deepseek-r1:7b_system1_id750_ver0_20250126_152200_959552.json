    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given risk factors for this 18-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18 years old. At this age, he's likely still developing, so his decision-making might not be as mature as someone older. That could mean lower responsibility for past actions.\n\nHe identifies as White, which doesn't directly relate to risk unless there are stereotypes involved, but I shouldn't assume that. It's more about the factors listed.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That suggests he might face some legal consequences in the future if he chooses to break the law again without getting caught. However, since he isn't convicted yet, it doesn't show a history of serious offenses.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 2 inches and over 250 lbs. Being overweight can have health implications that might contribute indirectly to risks like substance use or chronic diseases.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living independently without support could increase stress or isolation, which might lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which indicates he has some level of responsibility towards his education and perhaps stability. This might help reduce risk compared to someone not engaged in school.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences suggests he can manage tasks and work environments, which could mean better coping strategies and less likelihood of engaging in risky activities related to employment.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While past drug use is a risk factor, not feeling depressed now might indicate personal motivation or other factors influencing his behavior.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. This suggests he has had a stable living environment from a young age, which could be protective rather than a risk factor.\n\nHe believes in God and feels influenced by his faith. Religious beliefs can provide support and coping mechanisms, potentially reducing risky behaviors associated with a lack of support or environment.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the main risks seem to stem from past legal issues (arrest without conviction) and living independently (living alone). The arrest could be a sign of potential future criminal behavior despite not being convicted yet. Living alone might lead to higher stress levels or isolation, increasing the likelihood of risky behaviors like substance abuse.\n\nHowever, his educational involvement, job experience, and stable early life circumstances mitigate some risk factors. But since he's still 18, the lack of conviction is a significant factor that could influence future risk behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence because despite mitigating factors, the arrest history and living situation point toward potential continued risky behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
