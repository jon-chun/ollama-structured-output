    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one and think about how they might contribute to risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. I know there can be some disparities in how different groups are treated within the justice system, but that's more about systemic issues than an individual's risk. So maybe not the most direct indicator of personal risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a single arrest. Generally, one arrest doesn't necessarily mean he's high risk unless there were serious charges or if there's any history of violence. But here, it's just a simple misdemeanor, so that might be low risk compared to someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 8 inches and weight 145 lbs. I don't see an immediate association between these physical characteristics and risk unless there's something about his past or lifestyle that relates to weight, but nothing here suggests that yet.\n\nHe's living alone, which might be a sign of independence, which could be positive for risk assessment as it might indicate he can manage on his own. But also, being alone doesn't necessarily mean high risk; maybe more likely to commit low-level offenses or have substance use issues.\n\nNever married and living alone suggests he might not have the same level of support network that could help him in times of trouble. However, this isn't inherently a risk factor without knowing other factors like financial stability or mental health.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is often linked to better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates. So not having education might increase the risk because he could have fewer resources for getting help or staying employed, leading to more involvement with the system.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience can be positive; it shows he has skills and is capable of supporting himself. But if one job was recent and he's looking for another, that might indicate instability. However, two jobs generally aren't a bad sign in terms of risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be risky because it can lead to substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates. But since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe he's managed his substances better lately, which could lower risk.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite living alone without a support system. Dealing with lonliness or lack of support can lead to mental health issues, but if he hasn't felt depressed recently, that might suggest some coping mechanisms in place.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four. That's an unusual family structure and could have significant social implications, possibly leading to attachment issues or emotional instability later on. This could be a red flag for higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe believes in God but doesn't specify any religious affiliation beyond that. While belief in a higher power can sometimes reduce criminal behavior due to moral accountability, it's not directly related to risk factors like substance abuse or prior convictions.\n\nPutting all this together: one arrest, no high school diploma, living alone with a biological mother in a large household might increase the risk slightly. The lack of education could contribute more significantly because it affects his ability to get help or maintain stability. The fact that he hasn't been convicted but has an arrest, along with potential family issues, suggests some underlying risk factors.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, I think there's a moderate level of risk here. Maybe around 40-50% confidence. But since it's on a scale to 100%, I'll have to be precise.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 38\n}\n```",
