    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male of White ethnicity. That might be relevant because of potential implicit biases or stereotypes about his behavior based on race and age. But alone, that doesn't mean much for risk assessment.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. Multiple prior convictions are a strong indicator of criminal history, which usually correlates with higher recidivism risk. So this is a red flag.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs 135 lbs. That makes him underweight by about 20%. Underweight individuals might have lower self-esteem or health issues that could contribute to mood swings or substance use problems, which he admits to using drugs in the past four years.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can increase feelings of isolation and loneliness, potentially leading to substance abuse as a coping mechanism, which aligns with his recent drug use.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not completing higher education might leave him more vulnerable to stressors or less engaged in personal growth, contributing to unstable behavior.\n\nHe's held five jobs during the year, but that seems stable unless there are issues like frequent job changes leading to instability. However, it doesn't immediately indicate high risk without further details on job performance.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years and admits feeling down for most of the last month. Drug use can severely impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and affect relationships, all of which are concerning indicators of high risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. This could indicate exposure to family dynamics that might have influenced his behavior, but it's not directly tied to high risk without knowing more about those dynamics or any disciplinary actions.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could be related to religious issues or spirituality, which might affect his mental health and relationships. However, without specific evidence of religious neglect or conflict, this alone isn't a strong indicator of risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (4), drug use, underweight status, living alone, not in college, recent negative mood state. These factors point towards high risk because of the history of criminal behavior, possible substance abuse issues, and personal challenges that could lead to further instability or recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
