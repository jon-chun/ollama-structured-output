    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 19-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 19 and still in high school. Young age can be a red flag because it might mean he hasn't made significant life decisions yet, which could lead to more involvement with the system or have fewer life skills.\n\nHe identifies as Black, which isn't directly a risk factor but could imply he may face systemic biases that might affect his treatment or outcomes.\n\nArrested twice but not convicted. Twice is significant because even though it's not a conviction, each arrest can impact recidivism rates and may point to underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 170 lbs. While that doesn't immediately indicate risk, combined with other factors like lack of education and living alone, it might suggest he's in a vulnerable situation.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can increase feelings of isolation and stress, which could contribute to substance use or mental health issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. Without education, he might have fewer opportunities for positive development and could turn to substances as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Lack of income can lead to dependency on substances, unstable living situations, and increased risk of involvement with the system.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism and other negative outcomes. It also reflects underlying mental health issues that could be contributing factors.\n\nHe felt so down most of the past month. Persistent feelings of low mood can indicate depression or anxiety, both of which are significant predictors of poor outcomes in the justice system and personal well-being.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in a household of seven in an urban area. This indicates a complex family environment, possibly with limited support and exposure to negative influences like substance abuse or neglect, which can have long-term behavioral and mental health consequences.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal experiences. While spirituality might provide some coping mechanisms, it doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's evidence of neglecting other aspects of life.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrest incidents, lack of education, substance abuse, negative living situation, and young age. These factors collectively suggest a high likelihood of recidivism or involvement in the system again. The individual appears to be at significant risk due to these circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
