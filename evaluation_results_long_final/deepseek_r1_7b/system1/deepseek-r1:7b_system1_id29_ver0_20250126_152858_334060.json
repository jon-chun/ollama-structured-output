    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female Hispanic. Her race isn't directly a criminal risk factor, but being Hispanic can sometimes be associated with certain issues, though it's not definitive. She has been arrested once but not convicted, which is a minor infraction. Minor convictions are usually low risk unless there's a pattern.\n\nShe's 5'1\" and weighs between 200-224 lbs. That's on the higher side of BMI; she might be overweight, which can contribute to health issues that could affect her behavior or safety. Being overweight is sometimes linked to substance abuse or other risk behaviors.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living independently doesn't inherently pose a high risk unless there are underlying issues like mental illness, which isn't indicated here. She's enrolled in school, which suggests she has goals and might be motivated to change her situation, reducing recidivism risk.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can indicate stability or ability to adapt, which usually reduces recidivism risk. It shows she's resourceful and capable of managing herself.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to using marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some of the time during the last month feeling down. While drug use isn't always a strong indicator unless it's frequent or severe, especially since she only used marijuana. A recent bout of sadness might be temporary stress rather than substance abuse.\n\nShe felt so down that nothing could cheer her up in the past month. This could indicate depression or emotional distress, which can affect judgment and behavior. Emotional issues often lead to substance use as a coping mechanism but don't directly correlate with high risk unless there's a history of violence or serious offenses.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Living in a large family might provide support but could also mean lack of individual accountability, which might contribute to substance abuse if not supervised. Urban environments can sometimes have higher rates of certain issues but without specific info on that.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. This religious affiliation doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's a known correlation between religion and criminal behavior, which is rare or varies by culture.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors don't strongly indicate high risk. Minor arrest, living alone but not in a dangerous area, employment, moderate weight, limited substance use (only marijuana), recent emotional distress from sadness, and living with family of six. Unless the emotional distress leads to substance abuse which could be risky, but she only used marijuana recently. Her belief in God doesn't add risk.\n\nSo confidence level would be lower, maybe around 40%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
