    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 20 years old. Young adults are generally considered low risk because they're in their prime and have better life skills compared to older individuals who might be more prone to substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nRace: he identifies as White. There isn't a direct link between race and recidivism unless there's systemic racism, which I don't have information on here. So maybe not much of an impact.\n\nArrests: 2 times but no conviction. Having arrests without convictions can still be concerning because it might indicate past behavior issues that could lead to more serious charges if he decides to retry or face new ones.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 1 inch, 180 lbs. This makes him quite tall, which isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself unless there's an associated health issue like heart problems or other physical vulnerabilities. But it doesn't directly point to criminal risk.\n\nLiving alone: currently living alone. Living with someone usually provides support and stability, but living alone can also mean isolation, which might lead to self-harm or substance abuse.\n\nEducation level: high school diploma not enrolled in college. Completing high school is generally a positive indicator of future behavior compared to those without education, but not enrolling in college could suggest some lack of motivation or interest in furthering his education, which might correlate with more serious behavior.\n\nEmployment: held 1 job during the year. Having a stable job is usually protective against recidivism as it provides economic stability and less time for risky activities. One job isn't enough to indicate high risk unless it's in a particularly unstable sector.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug-free status is a strong positive indicator of lower risk, so this factor leans towards low risk.\n\nMental health: no depression over the past month. Being mentally stable contributes to overall well-being and reduced likelihood of engaging in risky behavior that could lead to criminal charges.\n\nFamily history: at young age lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a stable, supportive environment is usually protective against delinquency or substance abuse. Urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates, but if he's living with his parents, that might mitigate some risks unless there were other issues.\n\nReligion: believes God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and may reduce substance abuse or risky behavior as part of spiritual guidance.\n\nPutting it all together, while none of the factors directly point towards high risk, most indicators suggest lower risk. The lack of convictions despite arrests is notable but not definitive. The job holding, education status, and mental health are positive signs. However, considering he's 20 and still in his prime years without any significant issues that would predict more risk as he gets older.\n\nI think the overall assessment might lean towards low to no high risk based on these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
