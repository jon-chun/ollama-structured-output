    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's Black, which is a known minority in some criminal justice contexts, but I don't know how that affects him specifically here. He has been arrested three times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions, especially for someone his age. He's 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs, which doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Being single in this context might not be directly related to risk but could indicate independence or lack of family support. He lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates, so not having one here suggests he might have more needs that aren't being met.\n\nHe's never held a job during the year, which can contribute to dependency on social services and increases risk of reoffending. His drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is concerning. Drug abuse is a major factor in recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While this might indicate resilience, it could also be a red flag if he's been dealing with other issues. It's a bit ambiguous. His background: at a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That suggests he was raised by his mother and might have had some form of family support.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which could affect his motivation towards positive behavior or seeking help if available through religious channels.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior arrests, lack of education, unemployment history, drug use. These factors are strong indicators of high risk for reoffending. While some factors like living alone might not be as significant on their own, the combination here seems to point towards a high-risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
