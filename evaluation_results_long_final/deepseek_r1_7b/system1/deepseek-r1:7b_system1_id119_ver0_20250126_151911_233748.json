    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the person described. Let me go through each factor one by one and think about how they might contribute to risk.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male of White ethnicity. Generally, being young might be associated with lower recidivism rates because people are still developing their skills and life choices. However, race can sometimes be a factor due to systemic issues, but at 20, it's probably less significant than other factors.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might indicate some reluctance to commit serious crimes or perhaps he felt it wasn't worth the time and trouble. This could suggest he may not engage in criminal behavior again, which is a protective factor.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 5'11\" and 190 lbs. I don't see any direct correlation between height and weight and recidivism based on this information alone. Unless there's an issue with health from being overweight, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and currently single.\u5355\u8eab\u751f\u6d3b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u67d0\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5355\u8eab\u4eba\u58eb\u5728\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4e0a\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u5708\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u662f\u5426\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\n\n\u4ed6\u6709\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6587\u51ed\u5e76\u8bfb\u56db\u5e74\u5927\u5b66\uff0c\u6b63\u5728\u8bfb\u672c\u79d1\u3002\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e00\u822c\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u518d\u72af\u7387\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b8c\u6210\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u540e\u3002\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u80cc\u666f\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u597d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u3002\n\n\u4ed6\u53ea\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fc7\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6216\u8d22\u52a1\u72b6\u51b5\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u662f\u5426\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u5230\u72af\u7f6a\u98ce\u9669\u8fd8\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\n\n\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u6bd2\u54c1\uff08\u5927\u9ebb\u548c\u6d77\u6d1b\u56e0\uff09\u8fc7\u53bb\u56db\u5e74\u5185\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u6ca1\u6709\u611f\u5230\u6291\u90c1\u3002\u5438\u6bd2\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u518d\u72af\u7387\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5f53\u5b83\u5f71\u54cd\u5230\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u65f6\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u73b0\u5728\u6ca1\u6291\u90c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u660e\u4ed6\u5df2\u7ecf\u8c03\u6574\u4e86\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u6bd2\u54c1\u5bf9\u4ed6\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u51cf\u5f31\u4e86\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u5438\u6bd2\u4ecd\u7136\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u518d\u72af\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\n\n\u5728\u5e74\u8f7b\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u5728\u5bb6\u5ead\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a4\u4eba\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\uff0c\u548c\u7236\u6bcd\u5171\u540c\u751f\u6d3b\u8fc7\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u80cc\u666f\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4ed6\u6709\u8f83\u591a\u7684\u5173\u7231\u548c\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4ed6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\n\u4ed6\u76f8\u4fe1\u4e0a\u5e1d\u6709\u5173\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u547d\u8fd0\u3002\u5b97\u6559\u4fe1\u4ef0\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u72af\u7f6a\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\u3002\n\n\u7efc\u5408\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u5438\u6bd2\u53f2\u3001\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u9ad8\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e1a\uff08\u5982\u679c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u6ca1\u6bd5\u4e1a\u7684\u8bdd\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u91cc\u4ed6\u662f\u9ad8\u4e2d\u6bd5\u4e1a\u751f\u3002\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3001\u5355\u8eab\u751f\u6d3b\u7b49\u90fd\u6709\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5438\u6bd2\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u77ed\u671f\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u671f\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd8\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u4ed6\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u80fd\u4e2d\u7b49\u504f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f46\u8003\u8651\u5230\u5438\u6bd2\u7684\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u7a0d\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u70b9\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
