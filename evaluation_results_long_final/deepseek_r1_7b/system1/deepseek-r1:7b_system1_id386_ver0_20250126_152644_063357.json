    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone involved in the criminal justice system. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 22 years old and male, identified as White. Age might not be directly indicative of risk unless there are specific recidivism statistics for that age group, but I don't have that information here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's a red flag because being arrested multiple times can indicate a history of trouble, but only one offense without a conviction doesn't necessarily mean high risk. It depends on the nature of the arrest and whether it led to any serious complications.\n\nHe is 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 157 lbs. His height and weight don't immediately suggest anything about his risk level unless combined with other factors like body type or previous issues, which they aren't here.\n\nNot married and not living alone\u2014living situation can sometimes be a factor if there are family dynamics, but without more info on that, it's hard to assess. He says he considers God involved in his life, which might indicate a stable upbringing or religious support, potentially reducing risk.\n\nHe has no high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a significant predictor of recidivism. Not having a degree puts him at a disadvantage both economically and socially.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can be beneficial as it provides income stability, but if he's switching jobs frequently due to instability, that could be a risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014he used marijuana. Drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, which might lead to more serious offenses or increased recidivism.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month\u2014this is a positive sign as chronic depression can contribute to substance abuse and other issues, but recent lack of depression doesn't necessarily negate risk factors from elsewhere.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Early exposure might have had an impact on his behavior or family dynamics, potentially affecting his risk level.\n\nConsidering the various points, the biggest risk factor here is that he has no high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational barriers can lead to unstable lives, which are associated with higher recidivism rates. The arrest count doesn't indicate a history of serious crime, but combining low education with other factors could increase risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\nThe analysis considers the lack of education and employment stability as significant risk factors. The absence of a high school diploma or GED certificate, along with being unemployed or underemployed, increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior again. Additionally, early family environment and substance use are also noted but do not outweigh the educational and employment risks.\nThe confidence score is based on the strongest risk indicators: low educational attainment (which is a well-known predictor of high recidivism rates) and the potential for unstable living conditions due to unemployment or underemployment. These factors alone suggest a moderate to higher risk, hence the prediction of \"YES\" with 75% confidence.\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
