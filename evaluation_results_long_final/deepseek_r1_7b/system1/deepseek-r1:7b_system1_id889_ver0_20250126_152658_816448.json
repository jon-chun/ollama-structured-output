    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from a Black background. His race can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates in some studies, but it's not always consistent. So that might be a point towards, but I don't know if it's significant here.\n\nHe has been arrested 19 times and convicted. That seems like a red flag because multiple convictions increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior. High recidivism is definitely a high risk indicator.\n\nHis weight is 210 lbs. While being overweight can sometimes be a risk factor, especially if it's due to substance abuse or other health issues, I'm not sure how significant this is on its own without more context like BMI or current health status.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there are other factors like unstable relationships or lack of support networks. Without that info, it's a bit neutral.\n\nEducation-wise, he lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Low education levels often correlate with higher recidivism because they might not have the skills needed for better employment or effective communication. That adds to the risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is another indicator of high risk since being out of work can lead to more substance abuse, lack of income support, and increased chances of criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down during the last month. Substance abuse, especially with drugs like marijuana, is a known risk factor for both recidivism and other related issues like theft or violence.\n\nFeeling down without any coping mechanisms could lead to further substance use or self-harming behaviors, which are indicators of high risk.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in a household of eight in an urban area. Young age can sometimes mean he was raised harshly or lacks supervision, especially if it's an urban setting where opportunities might be limited. This could contribute to behavioral issues and higher risk.\n\nBelieving in God as part of his personal circumstances. While religion can provide support, if he's struggling mentally or dealing with trauma, this belief might not protect him from negative life choices.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, living conditions that might be stressful, and a young age. All these factors point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
