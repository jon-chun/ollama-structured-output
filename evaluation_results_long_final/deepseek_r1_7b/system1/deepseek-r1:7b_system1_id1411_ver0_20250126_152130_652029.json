    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The person is a 22-year-old male identified as White. He's been arrested four times and has convictions, which immediately raises concerns about past behavior that might impact his current risk level.\n\nHe's described as tall (6'4\") and heavy at 190 lbs. While physical attributes can sometimes be red flags in terms of health or potential substance issues, they don't directly correlate with criminal tendencies without further context. His lack of marriage and not living alone is interesting\u2014maybe indicative of unstable living situations, which could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college. This suggests he's actively seeking higher education, which might indicate some level of self-motivation, but it also means he might be less likely to engage in risky behavior related to not completing his formal education, such as joblessness or lack of support.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Job instability can sometimes lead to financial strain and increased risk of substance abuse, especially if it's a low-paying gig. His drug use history\u2014only marijuana in the past four years\u2014isn't immediately alarming, but some recent use over the past month is concerning. He felt so down that nothing could cheer him up, which might point towards deeper mental health issues or stress.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in a household of four in an urban area suggests he was raised in a potentially stressful environment. This can sometimes lead to behavioral issues or substance abuse if not properly addressed. Additionally, his lack of religious affiliation (\"God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally\") might indicate a lack of support system or guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrest convictions, recent drug use (albeit marijuana), living in a stressful household environment, and a possible mental health concern due to feelings of low mood. These factors collectively suggest a high risk of engaging in risky behaviors. The person's age is still quite young, but the combination of these risk factors points towards a \"YES\" with a high confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
