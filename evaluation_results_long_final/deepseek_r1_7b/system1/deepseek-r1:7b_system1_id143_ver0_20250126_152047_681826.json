    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to analyze this risk factor step by step. So, the person is a 22-year-old White female who's been arrested once but not convicted. That one arrest might indicate some past behavior issues or possible substance use problems.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and 155 lbs. Her height and weight don't seem to be directly relevant here unless there's an issue with her ability to perform tasks, which doesn't appear to be the case from the given info.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to feelings of loneliness or isolation, especially if she hasn't found a partner. That could contribute to mood issues or depression symptoms.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree but isn't enrolled in college anymore. Maybe this indicates stability since she completed her education, but it might also show that she's seeking further opportunities beyond higher education.\n\nShe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences suggests some adaptability and work experience, which can be positive for managing stress or handling life changes. However, if one of those jobs was unstable or led to her arrest, that could be a concern.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine, with recent use within the last month causing significant low mood. Drug use is strongly linked to mental health issues like depression or anxiety. The mention of feeling down for much of the day points towards persistent negative emotions, which could indicate depression or other psychological problems.\n\nShe was living with both parents at a young age in a household of four in an urban area. That environment might have had its own set of challenges\u2014maybe family dynamics or exposure to negative influences that could affect her mental health later on.\n\nHer lack of belief in God suggests she may be experiencing some level of spirituality crisis or searching for meaning, which can sometimes lead to self-doubt or feelings of isolation if not addressed properly.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one arrest (possibly linked to substance use), drug use leading to mood issues, past living situation with family that might have contributed to emotional challenges, and personal beliefs affecting her mental state. These points suggest she is at moderate risk for some form of mental health issue or substance dependency.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has completed a Bachelor's degree and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year.
