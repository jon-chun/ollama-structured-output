    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male Hispanic. Age isn't typically a strong indicator of risk unless it's significantly above or below average, which it's not here. Being Hispanic doesn't directly correlate with higher risk without more context.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Repeated convictions, especially at such an early age, can be concerning. Each arrest increases the chances of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 185 lbs. These are average or slightly above average, so no direct risk there. Weight alone isn't a significant indicator unless there's associated health issues mentioned elsewhere.\n\nHe's separated and living alone. Living alone can be isolating but doesn't necessarily make someone a high risk without considering other factors like mental health.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college could mean he has low educational aspirations, which sometimes correlates with higher recidivism rates if there are no alternatives or support.\n\nNot working during the year might indicate unemployment issues. If he's unemployed, it can contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors if not properly addressed.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a positive sign; consistently clean individuals often make better risk assessments unless there's a reason to believe otherwise.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed for a month, which could be a red flag. Chronic lack of mental health support might lead him to consider alternative ways to cope or engage in risky behavior.\n\nLiving with both parents at age 15 in a household of six is a significant family environment factor. Small households can sometimes lead to higher dependency on others, but this alone isn't necessarily high risk unless there are other indicators like unstable living conditions.\n\nBelieving that God has no role in his life might suggest he's less likely to seek support or be influenced by positive societal norms, which could be a red flag for seeking help or engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the individual has some concerning aspects but not all. The key indicators are the multiple arrests and lack of employment. However, without additional information on mental health, living situation's stability, or support systems, it's hard to definitively label him as high risk. Therefore, I'll rate this as a low confidence (30%) because while there are some negative points, they don't strongly indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
