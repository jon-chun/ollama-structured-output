    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on their criminal justice context. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Hispanics are often a minority group in certain regions, which might influence risk assessments, but I don't have specific data linking his ethnicity to higher risk here.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Repeated arrests and convictions typically indicate a history of criminal behavior, which is generally associated with higher recidivism risk. Each arrest adds to the risk profile, so this could be a significant factor pointing towards high risk.\n\nHis physical description: 5 feet 11 inches and 160 lbs. While height or weight might not directly relate to risk unless combined with other factors like BMI, which isn't provided here. So, I'll note that but move on as it doesn't provide much information on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently not living alone. Living situation can influence support systems; however, without knowing if he has family or support, this factor might be neutral or slightly negative depending on the context.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level affects employment opportunities and future stability. Not having a higher education could increase risk as he may not have the skills needed for better job prospects.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job experience is important; holding just one job might indicate limited income potential or unstable living situation, which can contribute to substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\n\nNo recent drug use in the past four years and no depression over the past month. These positive factors suggest he's in a good mental state and doesn't have immediate substance abuse issues, which is reassuring for risk assessment.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two. This indicates stable living conditions from an early age, which can be protective rather than a risk factor unless there are other negatives not mentioned here.\n\nHe believes that God has no role in his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or spirituality, which might affect his personal well-being and decision-making regarding substance abuse or criminal behavior. However, it's subjective and depends on the individual's actual circumstances.\n\nPutting this all together: The most significant factors are the multiple arrests (3 times) and conviction, which point towards high risk. The lack of education, limited job experience, and current living situation also contribute to a higher risk profile. While some positive factors like no recent drug use and depression-free status are present, they don't outweigh the negative risk indicators.\n\nTherefore, considering all these elements, I would predict this individual as having a high risk, with a confidence level of 85%. This is because despite some mitigating factors, the history of criminal behavior significantly raises concerns about future offending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
