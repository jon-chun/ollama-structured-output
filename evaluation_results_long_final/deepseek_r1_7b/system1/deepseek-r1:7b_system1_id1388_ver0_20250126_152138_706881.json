    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age is a minor factor in risk assessment but having been arrested multiple times (7) suggests some instability or problematic behavior history.\n\nShe has a criminal history with convictions, which is a red flag on its own. The number of prior arrests usually correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 6 feet tall and between 175-199 lbs. This might not directly impact her risk but could be relevant for other assessments or understanding her behavior through body type.\n\nShe's living alone, which can sometimes correlate with isolation issues but isn't inherently a risk factor unless combined with other factors like drug use.\n\nEducation-wise, she lacks a high school diploma and hasn't enrolled in college. This suggests she might not have the skills necessary to avoid further trouble or make responsible decisions.\n\nOccupation: Only held one job during the year. Employment history can indicate stability; however, having only one job doesn't necessarily mean it's risky if she managed it reasonably well.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor as it increases the likelihood of further criminal behavior or complications like addiction disorders.\n\nHer mental health history: She felt very down for some of the past month, which could indicate depression or anxiety. These mental health issues can make individuals more prone to engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nShe's 19 years old and currently living alone. Young age combined with being an only child might lead to dependency on her environment or family, but since she's living alone now, it's a bit different.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area could have implications depending on other factors like the nature of their relationship or support available. However, considering the other risk factors, this might not be as significant unless there's evidence of neglect or abuse.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has some level of spirituality, which can sometimes influence behavior positively but doesn't inherently make her a high-risk individual if combined with other problematic traits.\n\nPutting all these together: Multiple prior arrests (7), lack of education, substance abuse, living alone, and young age. These factors point towards a high risk. The recidivism rate for individuals with such profiles is typically quite high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction is based on the significant number of prior arrests (7), lack of education, substance abuse history, and young age. These factors strongly indicate a high risk.",
