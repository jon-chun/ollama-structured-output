    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm not a legal expert, but I'll use the information given to assess the risk factors.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old White female. That might be relevant if there are stereotypes or biases, but I don't have data on that yet.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. One offense isn't too bad, especially since it's her first time. But convictions can still indicate some risk factors depending on the nature of the offense.\n\nHer height is 5'1\" and she weighs 110 lbs. No information here about whether this affects her risk; maybe if there was a risk related to physical activity or health, but nothing suggests that here.\n\nShe's never married and currently not living alone. Not sure how relevant this is unless it relates to other factors like social support or isolation, which aren't mentioned.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can sometimes indicate future behavior, but without more info on academic performance or grades, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Job history isn't directly linked to risk unless there are issues with unemployment or stability, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's concerning because substance abuse is a known risk factor for various behaviors like crime, addiction, and mental health issues. The fact that she felt down and couldn't be cheered up might indicate some underlying mental health issues.\n\nShe lived with both parents at a young age in a household of four in an urban area. This could suggest exposure to family dynamics or potential neglect if there were issues, but it's not clear here.\n\nHer belief that God has nothing to do with her personal life is interesting. That might relate to her spiritual or mental health, possibly indicating a lack of support system or facing challenges that she doesn't have religious coping mechanisms for.\n\nPutting this together: The presence of drug use (marijuana and cocaine), which can lead to substance abuse issues, and the belief that God has no role in her life, which might indicate some mental health concerns. These factors are known to increase risk of recidivism or other negative behaviors. The other factors don't seem to add much unless they hint at more concerning aspects like living situation or family issues.\n\nSo, considering these points, I think there's a moderate to high risk. She has substance abuse history and potential mental health concerns, which are significant in assessing her risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
