    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. His age might be relevant because younger offenders tend to have lower recidivism rates, but his race and being White are not directly indicators of risk without more context.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction increases the risk compared to someone with no criminal history. However, just one arrest isn't typically a very high risk unless there are other factors.\n\nHe is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs between 175-199 lbs. While his physical build might relate to substance use or health issues, without more info on his health status, it's hard to link height/weight directly to risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect mental health; being single might mean he doesn't have a support network which could increase risk if he's struggling mentally.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational barriers often correlate with higher recidivism rates because they may lack opportunities for positive development or job training.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, which might limit his income stability and life skills, potentially increasing risk if he's unemployed or underemployed.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant indicator of high risk as it can impair judgment, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\nHis recent feelings have been \"so down\" for most of the past month, suggesting possible depression or low mood, which are strong indicators of mental illness that could affect behavior and future risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area at a young age. Complex family environments can lead to emotional issues, which might contribute to higher risk if combined with other factors like drug use and mental health problems.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with his personal events. While this might indicate some level of spirituality or faith, it's not necessarily directly linked to high risk unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nConsidering all these points: prior conviction, lack of education, unemployment, substance use, and recent emotional distress are strong indicators. These together would likely indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
