    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step as I analyze these risk factors for the individual in question.\n\nFirst off, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. She has two prior arrests and a conviction, which immediately raises some red flags about her criminal history.Convictions, especially with multiple arrests, can be strong indicators of past problematic behavior, which might contribute to higher risk.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 140 lbs. While this information alone doesn't directly indicate high risk unless combined with other factors like weight relative to health or lifestyle choices. Her height isn't particularly concerning here.\n\nNext, her living situation: she's divorced and currently living alone. Living independently can sometimes correlate with higher self-reliance but also might suggest a certain level of instability if there are underlying issues. However, without more context on her current circumstances, it's hard to gauge the impact directly on risk assessment.\n\nHer educational background is another point: no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. This could indicate ongoing challenges with education, which often ties into stability and job opportunities. Without a steady income or career path, this can increase risk factors related to employment and future interactions.\n\nShe's had no jobs during the year, which points towards unemployment. Unemployment is linked to various risks, including lack of skills for re-entrant into the workforce, potential substance abuse issues she's facing, as indicated by her self-perceived low mood over the past month.\n\nHer drug use history is clean: no drugs in the past four years. That's a positive indicator and might actually mitigate some risk factors related to substance abuse. However, her mood swings could be linked to other stressors or personal issues she's not addressing.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. This suggests she was part of a multi-parent family living in an urban setting. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher stress levels due to community issues, but without knowing more about the dynamics within that family or surrounding environment, it's hard to assess.\n\nHer belief in God indicates a religious affiliation, which doesn't directly contribute to risk factors unless combined with other information like previous abuse or neglect. She might have a protective factor here if her faith is providing her with support and guidance.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, no education, living alone without a job, substance use history (though clean), and some indicators of personal distress. These elements collectively suggest she's at higher risk due to past problematic behavior, lack of stability, and potential underlying issues that could impact her ability to function effectively in the future.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I'm leaning towards a high risk assessment with confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year.
