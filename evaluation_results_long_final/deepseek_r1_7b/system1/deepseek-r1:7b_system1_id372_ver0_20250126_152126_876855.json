    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the given individual. Let's break down each of the risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might be more prone to reoffending if they don't get proper support early on.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted. Repeated arrests are a strong indicator of past criminal behavior, which usually correlates with higher risk of future crimes or substance abuse issues.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches and she weighs between 150-174 lbs. While this doesn't directly point to a high risk, her weight could be related to her living situation\u2014living alone might indicate some underlying issue, possibly substance use.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes signal social isolation or other personal issues that might contribute to higher risk behavior.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates; not having a diploma could mean she's facing barriers to better opportunities, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nShe held only one job during the year, which suggests limited financial stability and potential substance abuse since she might have less money for sobriety or other supportive measures.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. Drug abuse is a significant predictor of high-risk behavior; continued substance use can lead to further legal issues, domestic violence, etc.\n\nIn the past month, she feels extremely down and says nothing can cheer her up. This level of emotional distress could contribute to risky behaviors or self-harm, which are indicators of high risk.\n\nShe was living with her biological father in a household of four at a young age. Early-life experiences, especially from parents, can influence an individual's behavior and risk of involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nLastly, she doesn't believe in God personally. Religious beliefs often play a role in personal behavior; a lack of spirituality might lead to impulsive actions or a disregard for authority figures like judges.\n\nPutting all these factors together, each point contributes to a higher likelihood of high-risk behavior. Repeated arrest, lack of education, substance use, emotional distress, and living conditions with her father and lack of faith in God are all red flags that should be considered in assessing risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
