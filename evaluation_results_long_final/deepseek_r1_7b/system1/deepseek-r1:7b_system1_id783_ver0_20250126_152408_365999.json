    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old female and determine if they indicate a high risk. The user wants the response only in JSON format, so I have to make sure my final answer follows that exactly.\n\nFirst, let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nShe's a White female, age 20, with one prior arrest and a conviction. Being of color can sometimes be associated with systemic issues but in this case, she has already served her time. So maybe not a strong indicator yet.\n\nHer height is 5'4\" and weight 115 lbs. That's on the lower end; perhaps related to substance use? Not sure yet.\n\nMarried and living alone. Marital status can affect support systems, but living alone might mean less supervision. However, she's not an alcoholic or drug user as per her current feelings.\n\nNo high school diploma and no GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education could lead to risky behaviors if she's not motivated enough to succeed.\n\nShe has one job during the year. Having a job can provide stability, so maybe this is a mitigating factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't necessarily a high risk unless there are other factors like family history or mental health issues.\n\nYoung age (20) living with her biological mother in a household of five. That's a strong indicator for potential abuse, neglect, or family dysfunction. These can significantly increase risk scores because of the environment she grew up in.\n\nBelief that God has nothing to do with her life\u2014this could relate to spiritual issues, possibly leading to self-destructive behaviors like drug use or not seeking help when needed.\n\nPutting it all together: the family environment is a major red flag. Living with her biological mother in a household of five at a young age suggests possible neglect or abuse, which are high-risk factors. Her lack of education and limited job might contribute but aren't as significant without more context on how these relate to risk behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these points, I'd lean towards \"YES\" with a confidence level that reflects the strongest indicators (family environment) and moderate support from other factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
