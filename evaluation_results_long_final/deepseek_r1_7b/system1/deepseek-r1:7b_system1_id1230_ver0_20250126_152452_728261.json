    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male who's Black. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some prior trouble, but since it's not a conviction, maybe the impact is less severe compared to someone with a full record.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 145 lbs. That's pretty slim for his height, which could mean he's underweight or has a low BMI. Underweight individuals might have lower self-esteem issues, but I'm not sure how that directly affects risk here.\n\nLiving alone suggests he doesn't have family support, which can sometimes be linked to higher risk of substance abuse or neglect, though it's context-dependent.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe this indicates some level of education but also possibly lack of motivation for further education, which could relate to job opportunities or stability.\n\nNot working during the year might mean he's relying on other means of support, maybe drug use or welfare, though he hasn't used drugs recently as per the factors listed.\n\nHe isn't depressed over the past month. That's a positive sign; mental health is often linked to recidivism risk. If someone isn't feeling depressed, they might be more motivated to change their behavior.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. That could mean exposure to certain environments or family dynamics that might influence his behavior. Urban settings can sometimes have higher stressors but also opportunities.\n\nHe believes God is involved in his life. Religious involvement can provide a sense of purpose and support, potentially reducing risk factors like substance abuse or lack of motivation.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, no drugs, no depression, living with family, and religious involvement seem to counter some negative risk factors. The low educational level and lack of employment might be red flags for future issues. However, considering he's young (21), maybe the risk is lower because he's still developing his life skills.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low risk assessment here but not entirely certain without more context on his current circumstances like housing stability or any other potential stressors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
