    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male who's been arrested multiple times and convicted. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history is significant\u2014he's been arrested eight times and convicted. That alone points towards high risk because past convictions are strong indicators of criminal behavior.\n\nHis race is White, but since it's a categorical variable without any specific impact on the risk factors provided, I can note that as context but focus on other aspects.\n\nHe's 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150-174 lbs. The height doesn't immediately indicate risk, unless there are issues with weight or mobility, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone is a risk factor because isolation can lead to higher rates of substance abuse and criminal behavior. His GED status might suggest some educational barriers but not necessarily high risk; however, it's worth considering if this affects his employability or ability to reintegrate society.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone, which could contribute to feelings of isolation and potentially substance use issues. He's never married, so that adds another layer of social instability.\n\nNot being enrolled in college might mean he has limited opportunities for positive engagement with the community or education, which can be a risk factor as it may lead to underutilization of resources and higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having previous work experience is generally positive but having only two might indicate instability if those positions were inconsistent or if he's currently unemployed.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) over the past four years is a red flag, especially since even minor drug use can have significant behavioral and legal consequences. It could also be linked to other substance abuse issues like alcohol, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but if there's a history of mental health issues that haven't been addressed, it might still pose a risk. However, this is only for the past month, so I'm cautious not to assume ongoing mental health problems without more information.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with his biological father could indicate family dynamics or potential neglect, which are known risk factors associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life might be linked to existential despair. This lack of spirituality can increase vulnerability to substance abuse and criminal behavior due to a lack of purpose and support systems.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions (high risk), living situation alone (a risk factor), drug use history, family environment, and possible mental health issues contribute significantly. His age being 21 is in the early to mid-life stage, but given his history, he's likely at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```\nThe individual has a significant history of criminal convictions (8 times), which strongly indicates a high risk of reoffending. Additionally, living alone and having drug use history also contribute to his risk assessment. Despite some mitigating factors like being White and holding two jobs, the cumulative effect of these risk factors points towards a high likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
