    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's White. I'm not sure how this affects risk assessment, but maybe there are stereotypes or biases involved? Maybe it's worth noting, but perhaps not the most significant factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some prior trouble with the law, which could be a risk factor since being arrested can lead to criminal history and possibly other issues.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches, and he weighs 170 lbs. Not sure how this relates unless it's about physical health or something else. Maybe not directly relevant here.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. That could mean he has dependents or support, which might mitigate some risks but I'm not certain.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Maybe lower educational attainment can be associated with higher recidivism rates? Not sure how strong that is though.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Stable employment usually reduces risk, so that's a positive sign.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have negative consequences, but if he's not experiencing negative effects now, maybe it's less of an issue.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at age 5 in a household of four in an urban area. That might suggest he was raised by someone who could provide care and support, which is usually protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nHis belief that God doesn't affect his personal life indicates lack of religious support, but without knowing the surrounding environment or other factors, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some negatives like past arrests and drug use, he also has a GED, isn't in college, has two jobs, is living with someone, and perhaps has supportive family. I'm leaning towards not high risk because of the positive factors outweighing the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
