    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested three times but not convicted. His height is 6'0\", weight 185 lbs. Unmarried and living alone. He has a high school diploma and is in college, has worked four jobs in the past year, used marijuana in the last four years, hasn't felt depressed in a month. At a young age, lived with a household of three. Relies on God for his personal outcomes.\n\nFirst, let's consider each factor step by step. The person has a history of arrest but no convictions\u2014so maybe previous failed attempts could indicate some reluctance to get involved in the legal system. That might suggest potential for future issues if he continues that pattern.\n\nHis age is 20; risk tends to peak earlier, so it's possible he's still developing life skills. His Hispanic heritage can sometimes be a mitigating factor due to cultural factors affecting his behavior or mental health, but without specific info on discrimination issues, maybe not directly relevant here.\n\nHe\u2019s been arrested three times, which is significant\u2014more than most people in that age group. Not being convicted might mean he faces barriers each time, possibly indicating low willingness to comply with court orders if he does get convicted.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly related unless there's an issue with substance use, but since he's used marijuana, maybe not directly tied to physical health issues here.\n\nUnmarried living alone\u2014could relate to mental health or substance abuse. Some studies suggest living in isolation can be a risk factor for certain behaviors if the environment isn\u2019t supportive.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment are positive factors; education is often linked with lower recidivism rates, so maybe this person is proactive about improving himself.\n\nFour jobs in a year\u2014he\u2019s working multiple roles, which might indicate he's handling responsibilities well or possibly juggling different activities to stay engaged. Sometimes having various income sources can reduce dependency on substance use as a crutch.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana use specifically. Marijuana is generally less addictive than harder drugs but can still have psychological effects. If he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, maybe he's managed it well or doesn't see its long-term impact as critical.\n\nRelies on God for personal outcomes\u2014this could be a significant mitigating factor if he believes in a higher power and follows moral guidelines based on that belief. It might suggest he has strong values to guide his decisions and less likely to engage in risky behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some negative risk factors like past arrests, the positive aspects such as education, job stability, and religious involvement might balance things out. The lack of a conviction could indicate he's not facing significant legal consequences for previous issues, which might mean he\u2019s more likely to change his behavior if given a chance.\n\nSo considering all these points, I think there's a moderate risk but not high. Maybe around 30-40% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
