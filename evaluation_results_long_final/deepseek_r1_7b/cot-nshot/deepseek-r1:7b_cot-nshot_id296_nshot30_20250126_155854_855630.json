    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who's White. He has been arrested twice and convicted once, but wait, it says he's been convicted? Or was that in another example? Wait, looking back, in the provided case, it's \"arrested 2 times and has been convicted.\" So two arrests leading to a conviction.\n\nHe is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That seems within a normal range; no extreme weight that could affect recidivism rates.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, so that's not a risk factor for being released from prison but maybe living situation affecting other factors like support networks.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\u2014so educational barriers can sometimes lead to more opportunities or lack thereof. But does that directly impact rearrest? Maybe indirectly if he's unable to get better education.\n\nHe held 2 jobs during the year\u2014he might have some income stability, which could help with reintegration into society and reduce recidivism chances.\n\nDrug use: past four years, he used marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior or higher crime rates after release.\n\nFelt \"so down in the dumps\" some of the time\u2014he mentions this as a current state. Emotional distress might affect his ability to function or seek help, possibly leading to more issues that could result in further offenses.\n\nAt young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of 3 in an urban area. Maybe living in an environment without strong support systems could contribute to higher recidivism rates if there's no guidance after release.\n\nHe believes God is involved in his personal events\u2014so maybe he has some form of spiritual support, which can be beneficial and reduce recidivism risk compared to having no support network.\n\nNow, considering all the factors, let's assign weights. The main points are past criminal history (two arrests), lack of education, drug use, living alone with limited support, and current emotional distress.\n\nThe two arrests should be high weight because prior convictions significantly increase the chance of rearrest. Lack of education is medium; while it might affect opportunities, not directly a crime, but could relate to recidivism through other means.\n\nDrug use is definitely high\u2014it's a direct risk factor linked to criminal behavior and increased chances of reoffending. Emotional distress also high because mental health issues can impede his ability to reintegrate into society without support.\n\nLiving alone with limited support (biological dad in urban area) might be medium, depending on how supportive that environment is. But since he's White and considers God involved, that could mitigate some risk factors, giving a slight lower weight there.\n\nPutting it all together: two high factors (arrests, drugs), medium factors (education, living situation), and one slightly low factor (religion). The overall risk seems high but maybe not extremely so because of the positive belief in God. However, considering the drug use and arrests are significant, I'll lean towards a high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests and one conviction significantly increase the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may affect educational opportunities, which could influence recidivism but is not a direct risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine correlates with higher criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"current_mental_health_state\", \"high\", \"F frequent feelings of low mood can impede reintegrating into society without support, potentially leading to further issues.\"),\n    (\"living_alone_with support\", \"medium\", \"Living alone in an urban area with a biological father may offer some support but not enough to significantly reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"religion_involved\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may provide spiritual support, which can reduce recidivism risk compared to individuals without such support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
