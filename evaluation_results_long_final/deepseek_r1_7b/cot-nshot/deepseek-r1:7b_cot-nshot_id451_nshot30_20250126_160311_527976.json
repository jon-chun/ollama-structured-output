    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 20-year-old White female will be rearrested within three years. Let's break down her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history: one arrest and one conviction. That alone is significant because prior convictions increase the likelihood of recidivism. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe's 5'8\" and weighs 135 lbs. Her weight might not be directly related to recidivism unless it's affecting her ability to contribute, but since she's in college and working three jobs, maybe it's more about stability than physical factors.\n\nMarital status: She's never married and isn't living alone. This could affect support networks, which sometimes help with reintegration after incarceration, so that might be a medium risk factor because less stable living arrangements can lead to higher recidivism.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college. Education usually helps reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Having work experience suggests she's proactive and maybe more likely to find employment upon release, which would be a low risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both negative and positive outcomes depending on context, but since she's not currently experiencing depression, it might indicate she's managed her substance use, making this less of a concern compared to someone with ongoing issues. So maybe medium risk.\n\nLiving situation at a young age: She lived with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. This could have positive social support but might also be associated with higher stress or unstable environments if not properly supported. It's a bit ambiguous, so perhaps a medium risk factor.\n\nConsidering her religion, she believes God has something to do with her life. Supportive religious beliefs can aid in reintegration and personal growth, which would lower recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The main high risk factors are the prior conviction. Everything else seems positive or neutral. So I lean towards low confidence but maybe slightly higher than usual because of the past arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Not living with a spouse or in a stable household may affect support systems but does not directly indicate high risk without additional factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level/College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in college and has a high school diploma, which are positive indicators for reintegration and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Has held three jobs during the past year, indicating stability and potential employability post-release, which reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Past Four Years\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years but has not felt depressed recently.
