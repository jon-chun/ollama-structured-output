    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors. The person in question is a 22-year-old female Black individual with several risk factors.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the provided risk factors and analyze each one:\n\n1. **Arrests**: She's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. This could indicate potential recidivism as prior convictions might signal past behavior, though not being convicted doesn't always mean she won't reoffend.\n\n2. **Age**: 22 years old. Younger individuals sometimes have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and decision-making abilities.\n\n3. **Height**: 5 feet 7 inches. While this isn't a direct indicator of risk, being shorter might affect job opportunities or living situations, which could influence criminal behavior indirectly.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: Never married but currently living alone. Living with family can provide support, reducing the likelihood of isolation and potential drug abuse leading to crime.\n\n5. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational barriers often correlate with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities for rehabilitation.\n\n6. **Job History**: Never held a job during the year. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse, which is a known contributor to criminal behavior.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While drug use itself isn't a direct cause of recidivism, it can lead to impulsive behaviors and increase the risk of future offenses.\n\n8. **Household Size at Age of 15**: Lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2. Smaller households might offer more supervision or less exposure to risky environments during formative years.\n\n9. **Religion/Spirituality**: Believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religious involvement can provide moral support and accountability, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\n\nNow, comparing this case to the provided examples:\n\n- In example 7 (similar to our case), a Black female with 2 prior arrests, similar age, living alone without education or jobs, used marijuana but no depression, lived with mother in a small household, and considered religion. Her outcome was YES for recidivism.\n\nThe key factors that contributed were the two prior arrests, lack of education, no job history, drug use, and living situation. The presence of religion slightly mitigated risk but wasn't sufficient to prevent recidivism.\n\nIn our case, all these same factors apply: two prior arrests, age 22, no diploma, no jobs, drug use, living alone with a small household, and belief in God. While the smaller household provides some support, the other factors heavily indicate higher risk.\n\nTherefore, considering the high number of negative indicators\u2014two arrests, lack of education, job history, drug use\u2014the risk is significant enough to predict recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted, which can indicate potential for future criminal behavior and limited support from prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old indicates she is still developing life skills which may increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"Her height doesn't directly correlate with risk but could be considered in conjunction with other factors like living situation and family support to assess potential isolation or environment impact.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, despite being married (though not stated), can lead to isolation which may influence substance use and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED indicates limited opportunities for positive influences such as job opportunities and educational resources that could aid in rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"high\", \"Never held a job during the year, leaving her with unemployment which can lead to dependency on substance abuse and higher risk of future crimes.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently.
