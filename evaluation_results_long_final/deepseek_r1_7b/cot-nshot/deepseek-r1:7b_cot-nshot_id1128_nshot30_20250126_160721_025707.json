    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 5 feet 8 inches, weighing 143 lbs. He has one arrest and it's been convicted. Weight-wise, he's underweight but not significantly so; maybe medium risk because lower weight can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates in some studies.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation is solitary, which isn't inherently bad but might contribute to isolation or substance use issues that could lead to more problems. Medium risk here.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. GED can be beneficial as it can lead to better job opportunities, so maybe this reduces his risk a bit. But not being enrolled might indicate he's seeking further education, which is positive. So perhaps low risk for this factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having gainful employment usually helps in reducing recidivism because it provides stability and motivation to change behavior. High risk here since holding two jobs shows a solid work history.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but felt down recently. Past drug use, especially withconviction, can be a red flag for future substance abuse issues which are linked to higher recidivism. High risk because of prior drug use.\n\nFeeling down and not coping well: This might indicate poor mental health or stress from life circumstances. This is a warning sign that could lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors. High risk here as it suggests potential mental health issues affecting his ability to function positively.\n\nYouthful age at arrest (19) but has a prior conviction. Young adults with prior convictions might face higher chances of reoffending due to lack of life experience and impulse control. Medium-high risk because despite being 19, having a prior conviction can increase recidivism rates.\n\nHousehold size at young age was 2, which is small, so maybe not contributing much to instability unless there's neglect or abuse elsewhere. Maybe low impact here.\n\nLiving alone: Some studies suggest living in single occupancy might be safer than multiple DWIs but still can lead to isolation if substance use is involved. Medium risk because it doesn't eliminate the possibility of issues related to living situation.\n\nNo current relationships and living with parents, so maybe he's seeking help or has support from family. This could lower his risk as he has a network that might assist in positive change. Low risk here.\n\nConsidering all these factors: two jobs (high), GED (low), prior arrest (medium), substance use (high), recent emotional distress (high), living alone with parents (low). The overall impact seems to lean towards high risk because of the strong indicators like past drug use, recent emotional issues, and prior conviction despite having a GED.\n\nThe presence of two jobs might help offset some negative factors, but the other factors seem more significant. So I'd predict \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism with high confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the risk factors analyzed:\n\n- **Two jobs**: High (gainful employment reduces recidivism)\n- **GED and enrollment**: Low (educational completion is positive)\n- **Prior arrest**: Medium (conviction can increase chances)\n- **Drug use**: High (past use linked to future issues)\n- **Emotional distress**: High (potential mental health impact)\n- **Living situation**: Low (parents' support mitigates risk)\n\nThe overall assessment leans towards high risk for rearrest recidivism.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Two jobs held during the year\", \"high\", \"Having two gainful jobs reduces the likelihood of recidivism as it provides stability and motivation to change behavior.\"),\n    (\"GED certificate without college enrollment\", \"low\", \"A GED can lead to better job opportunities, which may positively influence recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Prior arrest conviction\", \"medium\", \"Conviction despite having a GED may increase the chances of reoffending due to lack of life experience or impulse control.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past drug use can be a risk factor for future substance abuse linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Recent feelings of down mood\", \"high\", \"This may indicate potential mental health issues that could lead to risky behaviors or self-harm.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at youth age (household size 2)\", \"low\", \"Small household size may not contribute significantly to instability unless other factors like neglect are present.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
