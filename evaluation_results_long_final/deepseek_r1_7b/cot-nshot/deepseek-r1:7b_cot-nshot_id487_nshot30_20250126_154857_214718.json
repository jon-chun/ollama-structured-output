    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. So, I have a case of a 21-year-old White female who is trying to predict her rearrest recidivism over the next three years. She has some risk factors, but also some mitigating factors.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That might be a bit of a red flag because even though she's notConvicted, two arrests could mean she's had some serious issues that led to stops. But since she isn'tConvicted yet, maybe her actual risk is lower than someone with activeConvictions.\n\nShe weighs 160 lbs and is 5 feet 2 inches tall. Her weight is a bit above average for her height, but not extremely so. Her BMI might be in the normal or slightly overweight range, which could have implications on her ability to engage in certain activities that might help with rearrest risk.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. That's a neutral factor because being single isn't inherently high risk, especially if she's actively looking for someone, but it doesn't directly indicate recidivism either.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can be a mitigating factor as higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and stable lives, which reduce recidivism chances. So this might actually lower her risk.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience is generally positive for reintegration into society without rearrest issues, so that's a low risk factor here.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. This could be significant because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates. The mention of feeling down most of the time might indicate depression or other mental health issues, which also increase risk.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 when young, in a rural area. Being raised in such an environment could have its pros and cons. Rural areas sometimes have higher crime rates but can also offer more community support. However, living with multiple family members might suggest she had a stable upbringing initially.\n\nShe believes that God has no role in her personal events. This might indicate a lack of religious support system, which could affect her social network and emotional well-being, potentially increasing risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the drug use history and feeling down most of the time are strong red flags. The two arrests aren'tConvicted yet but still show past issues. The rural household and lack of religious support might add to her vulnerabilities. While she's educated and has work experience, these don't fully offset the other negatives.\n\nSo, weighing each factor: drug use (high), past arrests (medium), living situation (neutral), education (low mitigating), job history (low mitigating), and personal beliefs (moderate). The overall risk seems to be on the higher side because of the drug issues and personal factors. However, she's actively engaged with education and work, which might help.\n\nBut given her drug use, especially since it's been ongoing for four years, that's a major concern. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism, so even if other factors are favorable, this could tip the balance towards rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (notConvicted)\", \"medium\", \"The individual has two prior arrests but no active Convictions.
