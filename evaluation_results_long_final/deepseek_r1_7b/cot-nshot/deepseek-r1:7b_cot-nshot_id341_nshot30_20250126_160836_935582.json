    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, I need to predict whether a 21-year-old male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. The person is White, hasn't been convicted for his two arrests, weighs 195 lbs at 5'10\", never married, living alone with a GED, no jobs, uses marijuana and cocaine, and lived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I'll go through each risk factor one by one. \n\nFirst, age: he's 21, which is relatively young but not too old for recidivism purposes. The examples don't have many people this age, so it's hard to say how much weight that should carry.\n\nNext, number of arrests: he has two, but they're not convictions. In the examples, higher numbers sometimes correlate with higher rearrest rates, but since these are non-convictions, maybe the impact is less? Or maybe not, since even minor arrests can signal issues.\n\nWeight and height: 5'10\"/195 lbs. The examples have similar or heavier individuals, so again, it's hard to gauge how this affects recidivism without more data on his weight relative to others in the dataset.\n\nEducation level: he has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. In some examples, having a GED was associated with higher rearrest rates because people with less education might struggle to find employment or support themselves. So maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving situation: living alone. The examples show various situations\u2014some living with parents, others alone or with spouses. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability and could increase risk, so that's probably a medium factor.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is strongly linked to recidivism, especially if it's recent. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed might reduce the risk slightly, making this perhaps lower than usual. So maybe medium-high?\n\nBiological family living situation: he lived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Larger households can sometimes mean more support and less stress, which might lower recidivism risk compared to smaller or different family environments.\n\nPutting it all together, the key factors that stand out are drug use (which is significant) and living alone, but also the lack of education. So maybe he's at a medium-high risk because of the drugs and living situation, despite having a GED.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **Drug Use**: High risk due to recent marijuana and cocaine use.\n- **Living Alone**: Medium risk as indicated by examples where similar situations often correlated with higher recidivism.\n- **GED**: Medium risk since it might indicate lower employability or support, but it's not directly linked in the data.\n\n**Prediction**: NO  \n**Confidence**: 60%\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests (non-convictions)\", \"medium\", \"He has two arrests, which can signal potential issues without convictions. The examples show that more non-convictions might correlate with lower rearrest rates compared to those with convictions, but it's not the highest factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana and Cocaine)\", \"high\", \" drug use is strongly linked to recidivism, especially recent use.
