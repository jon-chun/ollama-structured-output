    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this 18-year-old female case based on the provided risk factors and determine her 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18, which is quite young, but that might be a positive indicator since she's still developing and may not have had significant life experiences yet. However, it could also mean she has less criminal history.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's an important point because being convicted carries more weight in recidivism prediction. So this factor is medium risk because even though she was arrested, she didn't face consequences.\n\nHer height and weight are within a normal range (5'7\" to 199 lbs), so no issues there. She's never been married and living alone, which might suggest she's in a stable living situation without family support, increasing her risk slightly.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is a strong positive indicator as education can lead to better job opportunities and reduce recidivism. So that factor should be low risk.\n\nShe has held 2 jobs during the year, which is good because having some work experience can help with stability and financial management. This is a medium risk factor but leans towards low since she's actively employed.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can have negative consequences on mental health and relationships, so this is a high-risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate good mental health, possibly due to her job or school situation. However, her drug use could indirectly lead to depression if she's struggling with addiction.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of 4 suggests she has some support from family, which is a mitigating factor, but the size and dynamics of the household can vary. So this might be low risk.\n\nHer belief that God doesn't influence her personal events could affect her mental state or outlook on life, potentially increasing stress or anxiety related to drug use, which in turn could increase recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium to high risk factors include past drug use and lack of family support. Positive factors like being enrolled in school and having a job balance things out. However, the combination of low education (if she's still in school) and ongoing drug issues might tip her towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age is 18, which could indicate potential for future criminal activity but may also suggest less life experience affecting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest without a conviction, which could increase risk as convictions have more weight in predicting future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Normal height and weight do not indicate significant health issues that might correlate with higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common among youth but living with her mother suggests some family support which could lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school, which typically provides positive influences such as stability and opportunities for better outcomes.), \n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Two job holds indicate active engagement but may not yet be stable or provide long-term benefits affecting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor, potentially leading to relapse or further issues that could affect future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month might suggest good mental health but drug use could be indirectly linked to stress factors increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with her mother in a household of 4 provides some support, which can mitigate certain risks associated with living alone.), \n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Considering God has no influence on personal events may lead to increased stress or anxiety related to drug use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
