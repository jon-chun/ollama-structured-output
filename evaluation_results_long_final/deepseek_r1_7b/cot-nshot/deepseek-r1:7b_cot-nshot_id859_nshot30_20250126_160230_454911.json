    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to analyze the risk factors for a 22-year-old female named Maria who is White, has been arrested once and convicted, weighs 5'4\" and 165 lbs, is married living with her spouse, no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, held one job during the year, hasn't used drugs, hasn't felt depressed, lived with both her parents in a rural household of size 6 at a young age, and believes God influences her life.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each example given to see how similar Maria's situation is. Looking at examples from 1 to 30, I notice that several factors influence rearrest recidivism, such as prior convictions, education level, living arrangements, and family structure.\n\nMaria has one prior conviction, which is significant because prior offenses increase the risk of recidivism. She's married and living with her spouse, which might provide some stability compared to someone living alone or in a different household environment. However, she doesn't have a high school diploma, which is another negative factor since education can influence job opportunities and future criminal tendencies.\n\nShe has no job experience this year, which could mean she's relying on her husband for income, but if she's not actively employed, that might affect her ability to support herself or make independent decisions. Not using drugs is a positive sign as drug use is often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHer living situation with both parents in a rural household of 6 people could indicate a stable environment, which might be protective against recidivism compared to smaller households or different living conditions. She believes God influences her life, which is a positive factor as spirituality can sometimes aid in personal growth and decision-making.\n\nHowever, Maria's age is 22, which is relatively young, so she's just entering the workforce. Younger individuals might have fewer life experiences that could contribute to better decision-making or stability. Additionally, despite being married, if she's experiencing economic stress or other challenges, that might increase her risk.\n\nPutting it all together, Maria has some mitigating factors like living with both parents and no drug use, but also several risk factors including prior conviction, lack of education, single living situation (even though she's married), and age. Prior convictions are a strong indicator of higher recidivism because they show a history of breaking laws.\n\nThe high number of risk factors here\u2014like prior arrest, lack of education, and single living situation despite being married\u2014suggest that her risk is on the higher side. However, the stabilizing influences like family living and religious belief might temper that risk a bit. \n\nConsidering all these points, I'm leaning towards predicting \"NO\" for recidivism in the next 3 years but with some caution because of her prior conviction and other factors. My confidence would be medium-low since while there are protective aspects, the presence of significant risk factors brings down the overall likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate, which may limit opportunities and contribute to criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Married living with spouse - provides some stability but may not directly impact rearrest risk compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\" employment\", \"low\", \"No job held during the year which could affect financial stability and future independence.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"low\", \"Has not used drugs in past four years, which is protective as drug use is linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"family_living\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both biological parents in a household of six in a rural area - provides stability but rural living can be challenging and may influence lifestyle choices.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believes God has influence on life - positive factor often linked to personal growth and accountability which may aid decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
