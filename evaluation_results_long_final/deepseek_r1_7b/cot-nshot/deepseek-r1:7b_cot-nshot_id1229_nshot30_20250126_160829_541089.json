    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. The person is a 19-year-old female Black individual with several risk factors. \n\nFirst, her age is 19, which might be too young but since she's already in the system, she has some history of criminal behavior from that time.\n\nShe has one arrest but hasn't been convicted yet. This could indicate potential for reoffending if not properly addressed.\n\nHer weight and height are within a normal range, so no physical risk factors here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which might suggest some social isolation or lack of support system contributing to her emotional distress.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational barriers can contribute to recidivism if she doesn't have the necessary skills or opportunities for personal development.\n\nShe has worked three jobs during the year. Having multiple job experience is generally positive, as it shows adaptability and financial stability, which might reduce the risk of further involvement with the system.\n\nHer use of marijuana in the past four years could indicate substance abuse issues, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates if not managed effectively.\n\nMost of the time during the month she felt down, which suggests significant emotional distress or low mood. This could be a sign of deeper mental health issues that might contribute to criminal behavior if not addressed.\n\nShe lived in a household of five at a young age, indicating a possibly unstable family environment, which can affect self-esteem and decision-making skills.\n\nConsidering her religion has some influence on her personal well-being, but it's unclear how directly this affects her recidivism risk here. It might suggest she seeks support from her faith, which could be positive if properly integrated into her life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, people with multiple past arrests, substance abuse, lack of education, and emotional distress tend to have higher rearrest rates. However, having a job experience is mitigating.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: one arrest (medium), no diploma (high), living alone (high), three jobs (low because it's positive but maybe not directly related to recidivism), marijuana use (medium), emotional distress (high), young age (low impact?), and unstable family background (high). \n\nThe overall risk seems moderately high, so I'll predict \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"She is 19 years old, which might indicate potential for reoffending as she is still developing her life skills and experiences.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but not convicted, indicating potential for future criminal behavior if not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Normal range with no physical risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Never married and living alone, which might indicate social isolation or lack of support system contributing to emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma and not enrolled in college, indicating potential barriers to personal development and independence.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Held 3 jobs during the year, showing adaptability and financial stability which might reduce reoffending risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in past four years, which is often linked to criminal behavior if not managed effectively.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Felt down most of the time during the month, suggesting potential mental health issues contributing to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Lived in a household of size 5 at young age, indicating possible instability affecting self-esteem and decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"Religion Influence\", \"low\", \"Considers God has something to do with her personal well-being, which might suggest seeking support but not directly linked to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
