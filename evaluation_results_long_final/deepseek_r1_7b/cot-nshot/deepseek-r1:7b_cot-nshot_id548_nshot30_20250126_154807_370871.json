    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for an 18-year-old female who's White. She has some risk factors listed.\n\nFirst, her age is 18, which might mean she's in school and not yet established a lot of life ties. But that could also be a positive since she's young and might focus on education.\n\nShe was arrested once but not convicted. That's one arrest, so she does have a criminal history, but it hasn't resulted in a conviction. Depending on the court's judgment, this could affect her chances.\n\nHer weight is 130 lbs, which seems underweight for her height and age. Underweight individuals might face health issues that could contribute to recidivism, like poor nutrition affecting mental health or substance use.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which she mentions feeling down recently. Isolation is a risk factor for depression, which in turn can affect her mental health and ability to function properly, potentially leading to more substance abuse.\n\nShe's enrolled in school now but has held 3 jobs during the year. Having worked multiple jobs might indicate some level of stability, but if those were lower-paying or not full-time, it could be a concern. Alternatively, having job experience might show she can handle responsibilities better than someone without work history.\n\nShe uses drugs: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of substance abuse issues, which can lead to mental health problems like depression. She also mentions feeling down recently, which ties into the drug use and could indicate ongoing struggles with mental health.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological dad in an urban area's household of 4. Urban living might mean more stress from higher crime rates or socioeconomic factors. Living with a parent can offer support, but a household size of 4 suggests some family pressure that could contribute to issues like isolation.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal matters, which is a strong indicator of good mental health and positive life orientation. This might offset some negative risk factors by indicating she's proactive and less likely to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: She has one arrest but no conviction, which could be seen as a minor issue. Her weight might not directly impact her, but her substance use is concerning. The isolation from living alone and feelings of depression suggest possible mental health issues that aren't being addressed properly, leading to more drug use or other problems.\n\nShe's in school now and has job experience, which shows some stability, but the high number of risk factors (arrest, drug use, isolation) might outweigh the positive aspects. Her good spiritual orientation could help mitigate negative outcomes.\n\nSo, considering all these points, she's at a higher risk for rearrest because of her substance abuse, recent emotional low, living alone, and lack of conviction despite an arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 18, which might indicate she is in school and focusing on education, potentially reducing risk factors related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, suggesting minimal criminal history that could impact future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight of 130 lbs might not directly correlate with recidivism unless it's a sign of poor health leading to substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which she has mentioned, potentially contributing to mental health issues and drug use.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"high\", \"She has held 3 jobs during the year, indicating some level of responsibility and potential stability, but it's unclear if these were fulfilling or problematic.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"She uses marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and feels down recently, indicating ongoing substance abuse issues that can lead to mental health problems.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological dad in a household of 4 in an urban area might present stressors but also some support, though it's unclear how this affects recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Orientation\", \"high\", \"She believes God has something to do with her personally, indicating good mental health and positive life orientation which could reduce risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
