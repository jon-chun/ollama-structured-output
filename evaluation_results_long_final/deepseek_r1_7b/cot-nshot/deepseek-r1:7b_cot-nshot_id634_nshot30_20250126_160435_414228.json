    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step. The person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested once and convicted. He's married living with his spouse, has a GED, isn't enrolled in college, has two job experiences, uses marijuana, hasn't felt depressed recently, lived in a household of size 2 with non-biological parents, and doesn't believe in God affecting his life.\n\nFirst, the age is 22. Young adults often have lower recidivism rates because they're more likely to focus on building their future through work and stable relationships. So that's a positive sign.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stability in home environment can reduce stress and negative influences, which might lower the risk of rearrest.\n\nHe has a GED. Education is generally linked to better job opportunities and higher chances of success, which could mean lower recidivism.\n\nNot enrolled in college might indicate some reluctance or difficulty in continuing education, but since he has a GED, that's still a positive indicator.\n\nHe's used marijuana before. Drug use can have both negative and neutral effects depending on the context.Marijuana is less harmful than other drugs, but it can still affect mental health and decision-making, which might slightly increase the risk compared to non-users.\n\nHaven't felt depressed in the past month. This is a positive factor as chronic depression or anxiety can lead to substance abuse issues that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe lived with non-biological parents in a household of two. While living with others isn't inherently bad, being part of a household without biological ties might mean less emotional support and more stressors, which could influence his behavior.\n\nDoesn't believe in God affecting his life. Without religious support, he might rely on other factors like family or friends for guidance, but if those are absent, it could increase risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: the positive ones (age, marriage, GED) seem to outweigh the negatives (drug use, household dynamics). The presence of a GED and stable living situation with a spouse might mitigate any negative influences. However, the past drug use isn't something that can be easily reversed, which could still raise the risk.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are mitigating factors like education and marriage, the past drug use is a red flag. Without strong support systems or further positive influences, there's a moderate chance he might relapse.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is within a prime age range for entering into stable relationships and career paths, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living with his spouse indicates a stable home environment, which can positively influence behavior and reduce stress factors that might contribute to rearrest.
