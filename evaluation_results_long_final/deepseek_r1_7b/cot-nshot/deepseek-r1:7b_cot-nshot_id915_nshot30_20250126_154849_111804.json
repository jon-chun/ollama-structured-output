    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old Black female. I'll start by looking at each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Most of the examples are adults, so maybe a bit younger doesn't directly affect, but it's something to note.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, being arrested even without a conviction can be a risk factor because it shows past behavior that might lead to more issues.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 3 inches and she weighs 230 lbs. The examples vary in weight categories, but this seems on the higher side. Weight isn't directly mentioned as a factor here, so maybe not a big issue.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Being single can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism rates, especially if she might feel lonely or unsupported, which could contribute to her mood issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; having a degree might indicate better job prospects, so maybe this is a protective factor. But since she's not actively learning, it's uncertain.\n\nNo jobs held during the year. Unemployment can lead to financial stress and increased risk of substance use or other issues contributing to depression.\n\nShe uses marijuana but hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Drug use without severe mental health issues might be a gray area. Some examples show even moderate drug use with no depression, which could still indicate potential issues.\n\nShe feels down some of the time. Emotional distress is a clear risk factor for recidivism. The example that matches this is someone feeling \"so down\" and has a higher chance, but since she's not feeling it all the month, maybe the impact is less severe.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of 6 in a rural area. Small households can sometimes offer support, so this might be protective rather than a risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has no role in her life, which could lead to higher levels of anxiety or depression if she's not finding meaning elsewhere.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some risk factors like arrest without conviction and living alone but also some protective factors like education. The mood issues might be significant enough to predict a YES outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may indicate she is still developing risk factors related to recidivism as seen in the examples where similar age groups were observed with varying outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction, which might be a minor risk factor compared to other factors like living alone or not being enrolled in school.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is 230 lbs, which does not directly correlate with recidivism as seen in the examples.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Housing\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 17-25 years old can be a risk factor for mental health issues affecting her ability to function socially or economically, similar to some of the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college.
