    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 22-year-old White female. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her prior arrest: she has one prior arrest and it's been convicted. That seems significant because prior convictions are a big indicator of recidivism.\n\nHer age is 22, which isn't too old but also not young enough to have had many experiences that might contribute to substance use or other issues.\n\nShe weighs 115 lbs, which is below the typical adult weight range for her height (5'6\"). This could indicate she's in an underweight category, which sometimes correlates with certain health issues or substance abuse.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can influence substance use and social support, so living alone might increase risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is usually linked to lower recidivism rates when applied correctly, but not being enrolled might mean she's facing other challenges.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job stability can affect mental health; perhaps she's dealing with stress or substance use issues at work.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed last month, which might suggest she's managing her issues well, but it could also mean she's not seeking help when needed.\n\nLiving with both parents as a child suggests she had support, which usually reduces risk factors.\n\nShe believes in God, which can provide emotional support and may influence her behavior.\n\nPutting this together: Prior conviction is high. Weight might indicate health issues or substance use. Lack of marriage and living alone could increase stress or substance use. Educational status doesn't directly contribute positively but isn't a strong negative either. Employment is positive but maybe related to job stress. marijuana use is a risk, and her mental state suggests she's managing it but may need help.\n\nConsidering all these factors: prior arrest (high), weight (moderate?), living situation (maybe medium low), education (no impact), employment (low), drug use (high), mental health (low), family support (high). \n\nI think the high prior arrest and ongoing substance use will heavily influence her recidivism. The positive factors like education, marriage, and family support might somewhat mitigate but aren't enough to outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the 22-year-old White female:\n\n- Prior Arrest: High (1)\n- Weight: Medium Low (1)\n- Living Situation: Medium (2)\n- Educational Attainment: Low (2)\n- Employment: Low (3)\n- Drug Use: High (4)\n- Mental Health: Low (5)\n- Family Support: High (6)\n\nConsidering these factors, the prediction is that she has a high risk of rearrest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium_low\", \"Her weight is below average for her height (5'6\\\"), potentially indicating health issues or substance use.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase stress or substance use challenges.\"),\n    (\"educational_attainment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college could be a neutral factor depending on other circumstances.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employing one job during the year might be positive, but it doesn't directly relate to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month may suggest good mental health or successful management of issues.\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"high\", \"Living with both biological parents and believing in God indicates strong family support, which reduces risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
