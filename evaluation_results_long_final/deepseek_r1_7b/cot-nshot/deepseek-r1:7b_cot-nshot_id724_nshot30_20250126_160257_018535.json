    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old male who's White. He has a lot of arrest history\u20148 times\u2014and he's been convicted. That seems really high. Eight arrests are a strong indicator of past issues, which probably makes him more likely to rearrest.\n\nHe's currently 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That's on the lower end for his height but within a normal range. His weight isn't necessarily a risk factor unless it's accompanied by other factors like substance use, which he does have.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, so no one to provide support or help him manage substances. Substance use is a big risk factor because it can lead to addiction and further legal issues if it escalates.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Getting a GED doesn't directly predict recidivism, but not being enrolled might show some lack of commitment, which could be a sign of instability.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience is generally positive for reintegration, but it also depends on whether he was able to manage substance use while employed or if he struggled with other issues.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) without feeling depressed\u2014this could be problematic because even if he doesn't feel depressed, marijuana can impair judgment and lead to more impulsive decisions. Not feeling depressed might mean he's managing it well, but it's still a risk factor compared to someone who is severely affected.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of 4. That suggests some exposure to family dynamics that could have issues, maybe substance use or neglect, which can carry over into adulthood.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal happenings, so he might not seek help or support from religious or spiritual sources, which are often helpful for managing substance use and other issues.\n\nPutting it all together: high arrest history (8), GED but not in college, two jobs, some family background, drug use without severe depression, lack of marriage and living alone. These factors point towards a higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"His extensive arrest history (8 times) and conviction indicate a significant pattern of past illegal behavior, which strongly suggests a higher likelihood of future criminal activity and rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"His weight is within a normal range for his height, which may indicate better physical health compared to other risk factors like substance use.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse increases the risk of isolation and potential substance abuse issues, as he has no support system to help manage these challenges.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college may show some level of education completion, which could be a positive factor if he's able to reintegrate successfully, though it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs might indicate some work experience, but without knowing how substance use impacted his employment performance or stability, this is a moderate factor rather than high risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years without experiencing depression is concerning.
