    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old Hispanic male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of multiple arrests\u20144 times\u2014and being convicted. That seems like high recidivism because past convictions increase the likelihood of repeating the behavior. So that's a strong indicator pointing towards YES.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 185 lbs, which doesn't immediately raise red flags about his weight or health issues, so maybe no direct impact on recidivism here.\n\nHe's separated and living alone. Living in a single status can sometimes be a risk factor because he might not have the support system to help him after being released. Plus, if he's separated, he might face emotional challenges which could lead to further issues. So that adds some medium weight to YES.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is usually linked to better job opportunities and lower recidivism, so this factor would lean towards NO, reducing the risk of rearrest.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which could mean he's unemployed or under employable status. Without income, it might be harder for him to support himself without substance abuse or other issues. This is a medium factor supporting YES.\n\nHe's not using drugs and isn't feeling depressed. These are positive factors that reduce the likelihood of recidivism, so they would lower the risk towards NO.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of 6 in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher stress levels or social issues which might correlate with higher recidivism rates if not addressed properly.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal matters, which could indicate a lack of religious support, potentially affecting his motivation towards positive change but maybe also contributing to substance abuse or other issues that could lead to more problems in the future.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests (high), living alone and separated (medium), no job (medium), education not in use (low), no drug use (low), lack of support from family (maybe medium). The positive factors like no depression are there, but the negative ones are more significant. So I'm leaning towards a YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism as past behavior is likely to repeat.\"),\n    (\"living alone and separated\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and being separated can lead to isolation, which may contribute to negative outcomes such as substance abuse or financial instability that could result in rearrest.\"),\n    (\"no job during the year\", \"medium\", \"Lack of employment might indicate potential for unstable living conditions or substance use issues that can lead to further legal or criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"high school diploma and not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma, though not currently in education, can sometimes correlate with better job prospects reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"no drug use and no depression\", \"low\", \"No recent substance abuse and emotional well-being are positive indicators that could reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household size 6 living with both parents in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Living in a larger household in an urban setting may contribute to stressors or social issues that could indirectly affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"God has nothing to do with his personal matters\", \"low\", \"Believing in no higher power for personal matters might not directly impact recidivism but could be related to other factors like substance abuse which are mitigated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
