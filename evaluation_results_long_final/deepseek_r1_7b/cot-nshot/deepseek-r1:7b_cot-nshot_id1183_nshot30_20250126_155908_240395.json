    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this Black male who's 22 years old. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a red flag; people with a record are more likely to reoffend. So that's high risk.\n\nHe weighs 178 lbs and is 6 feet tall. No specific issues there, but weight isn't usually a direct factor unless it's related to other factors like substance use or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nNever been married and living alone: I don't see any immediate problems with this, so maybe medium risk since he's an adult without a family support system.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in school. GED is equivalent to high school and can sometimes help, but not everyone does well after getting one. Not enrolled in college might mean he doesn't have the skills or motivation for further education or training.\n\nNo jobs held during the year: Unemployment for an extended period can lead to dependency issues, which can increase recidivism. Also, having no income during such a time might leave him vulnerable.\n\nDrug use from past four years (marijuana) but hasn't felt depressed in the last month. So he has a history of substance abuse, but recent feelings don't indicate a current problem. However, drug use itself is still concerning and can lead to other issues if it escalates.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in an urban area: This could mean he's part of a larger household without support, which might not be ideal, but again, not directly a risk factor unless there are specific issues like domestic violence or neglect mentioned. Since none are noted here, maybe medium.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal happenstance: If someone feels they have control over their destiny through religion, it can sometimes lead to risky behaviors if they don't seek help. But this is more of a personal belief than an actual risk factor unless there's evidence of drug use or other issues tied to that belief.\n\nPutting all these together, the high arrest history and lack of support structures seem like the biggest red flags. The other factors are either neutral or minor. So I'm leaning towards a higher risk but not certain because some mitigating factors might be present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"One arrest and one conviction indicate significant criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no support system\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with non-biological parents in an urban area may lack the necessary support networks that could aid in avoiding further issues.\"),\n    (\"GED without college enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED does not guarantee success, especially if not enrolled in college or receiving additional training which can help reduce future criminal risk.\"),\n    (\"no job history\", \"high\", \"No prior employment shows instability or lack of financial stability, which are known contributors to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in the past indicates potential substance abuse issues that could escalate and lead to further criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
