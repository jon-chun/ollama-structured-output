    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given case step by step. The individual is an 18-year-old female identified as White. She has a few risk factors that I should evaluate.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a moderate risk because arrest alone doesn't lead to a conviction, so maybe medium weight. Since she's White and hasn't been convicted yet, it might be worth noting her lack of prior convictions as a factor, but perhaps it's more about the number than the race.\n\nShe weighs between 125 and 149 lbs at 5 feet 1 inch. That's underweight for her age, which could indicate health issues that might contribute to recidivism. So this is probably a high risk factor because weight is often associated with substance abuse and other health problems linked to recidivism.\n\nShe's never married and isn't living alone, which might suggest she's in a shared living situation or facing some instability. Shared housing can sometimes be a red flag for underlying issues like drug use or family dysfunction. So this could be another high risk factor because living with others without being married usually has different dynamics that might lead to substance abuse.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which is a significant risk. Educational attainment can predict future stability; not having a diploma might mean she's more likely to engage in risky behaviors again after release. This factor should be weighted highly because education plays a crucial role in reducing recidivism.\n\nShe held one job during the year, but since she's not convicted yet, maybe being employed despite an arrest could indicate some ability to manage her finances or responsibilities, which might reduce risk. However, with just one job and no prior convictions, it's a bit of a mixed signal. Maybe medium weight here because while employment is positive, having a job alone doesn't guarantee low risk without more factors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to substance abuse issues which might increase recidivism if not addressed. So this is probably a high risk factor since even occasional drug use can have harmful consequences and could escalate into more severe substance use problems.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area at age young, and she believes God doesn't influence her personal issues. Family living conditions are generally considered positive but the size here is quite large which might suggest instability or family dysfunction that can contribute to recidivism risk. Urban settings often have higher concentrations of certain issues like homelessness or substance abuse. So this factor could be a high risk.\n\nPutting it all together, several factors point towards a high risk. The weightings are assigned accordingly. Now, considering the examples provided earlier, when there were multiple high-risk factors, the outcomes varied but in cases with underweight, drug use, living with parents, lack of education, etc., the recidivism was more likely to be YES.\n\nSo, based on these risk factors, the prediction is that she will have a 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome of NO. Wait, actually looking at the examples again, when underweight or drug use was present without prior convictions, outcomes were mixed but in some cases it was YES and others NO. However, considering all high-risk factors here, perhaps the confidence is slightly higher towards a YES.\n\nBut since she has employment despite being arrested once, maybe that mitigates some risk. The overall weightings lead to leaning towards a moderate confidence of 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (1 time, not convicted)\", \"medium\", \"This factor is medium because an arrest alone does not necessarily lead to a conviction but can still indicate potential recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Underweight (125-149 lbs at 5ft1in)\", \"high\", \"Underweight status may signal health issues potentially linked to substance abuse or other health problems that could influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living with both parents in a household of 5, urban area\", \"high\", \"Living with family despite being non-married and not living alone suggests possible instability or family dysfunction which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma/GED, not enrolled in college\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a significant predictor of future criminal behavior due to limited opportunities and potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Employed one job during the year (arrested once)\", \"medium\", \"Employment despite an arrest suggests some ability to manage responsibilities, but this alone may not prevent recidivism without addressing other risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana) in past four years, no recent depression\", \"high\", \"Drug use can lead to substance abuse issues which might increase recidivism if not addressed and could escalate into more severe problems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
