    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old female. Let's go through her risk factors one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, she has a GED certificate. In most cases, having a GED can be seen as positive because it shows education, which is usually linked to better job opportunities and lower recidivism. So that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction is generally considered moderately high risk. It indicates some past issues but doesn't necessarily mean she'll repeat the behavior unless other factors are present.\n\nHer weight is 145 lbs, which isn't extremely low or high, so maybe no direct impact here. Not a significant factor in recidivism prediction.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence recidivism; sometimes being single might lead to higher stress or substance use, but it's not a clear indicator without more context.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having some education is good, but not continuing education could be a medium risk because sometimes lack of further education might affect job prospects and contribute to recidivism if there are underlying issues like substance abuse.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having work experience can be beneficial as it shows stability and ability to support herself, so that would lean towards lower risk.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse problems, which can increase recidivism risk. Additionally, she felt down most of the time during the month, which might suggest depression or anxiety, both related to substance use and mental health issues that can contribute to reoffending.\n\nLiving with her biological dad in an urban area at a young age. Urban environments can have different social dynamics, but living with a parent doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there are other factors like family dysfunction.\n\nConsidering God's role: She believes in God having something to do with her personal issues. This might indicate a sense of hope or moral support, which could be positive, balancing some negative risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant factors here are the prior arrest (medium), drug use (high), and feelings of low mood (high). While she has a GED and work experience, these aren't enough to offset the high risks from substance abuse and emotional distress. Therefore, her overall risk is likely medium-high for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"ged\", \"low\", \"Having a GED certificate indicates education, which can positively influence job prospects and may reduce recidivism risk compared to those without a diploma.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_convicted\", \"medium\", \"A single prior arrest and conviction suggests past behavior that could potentially lead to reoffending but doesn't guarantee it without considering other factors like substance use and emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is 145 lbs, which falls within a normal range and doesn't directly correlate with high recidivism risk based on body weight alone.\"),\n    (\"single_and_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher stress or substance use risks, but without additional context, it's considered a medium factor in this case.\"),\n    (\"education_incollege\", \"low\", \"She is not enrolled in college despite having a GED, which might indicate that she prioritizes other areas of life over education and could influence job stability and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"low\", \"Holding 3 jobs during the year suggests some financial stability and ability to support herself, which can reduce recidivism risk compared to those with fewer opportunities.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a significant risk factor that could lead to substance abuse issues and increased likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"mood_feeling_down\", \"high\", \"Feeling down most of the time during the past month indicates potential mental health concerns, which can contribute to substance use and other behavioral issues that may reoccur.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological dad in an urban area doesn't inherently increase recidivism risk unless there are specific family dynamics or issues present.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
