    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors mentioned in the case:\n\n- Age: 18 years old. Young age can be a factor; younger individuals might have fewer life experiences and skills.\n- Arrests: 1 time, and it's been convicted. A prior conviction is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n- Weight: 5 feet 10 inches and 127 lbs. Being underweight might indicate health issues or other personal circumstances that could affect behavior.\n- Marriage status: Never married. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n- Education: High school diploma and enrolled in a 4-year college. Having education is usually protective against recidivism, but the fact that she's still in college could indicate some instability.\n- Employment: Held 1 job during the year. Unemployment can lead to dependency on drugs as a way of coping or to find better opportunities.\n- Drug use: Past four years with marijuana use. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism rates.\n- Household size at young age: Lived with both parents in a household of 4, which was urban. Being raised in a larger household might have different dynamics but could also suggest support systems or lack thereof.\n- God's involvement: She believes in God. This personal belief can sometimes be a protective factor against substance abuse and other negative behaviors.\n\nNow, assigning weights based on the examples provided:\n\n1. **Age (18 years old): Medium** - Young age is associated with higher recidivism rates due to fewer life experiences.\n2. **Prior Conviction: High** - A prior conviction significantly increases the risk of reoffending.\n3. **Weight (127 lbs for a 5'10\" person): Low** - The examples didn't show clear correlation between weight and recidivism, but being underweight might indicate health issues that could affect behavior.\n4. **Living Alone: High** - Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness, which may contribute to drug use or other risky behaviors.\n5. **Education (HS diploma + college): Medium** - Education is protective, but still in college might show some instability, possibly leading to higher risk.\n6. **Employment: Low** - Employed one job; while having a job can be protective, the examples didn't indicate a strong correlation with recidivism here.\n7. **Drug Use (Marijuana): High** - Past four years of marijuana use is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\n8. **Household Size: Medium** - While living in a larger household might have different dynamics, it's not directly linked to higher risk unless there are issues like drug abuse within the household.\n9. **God's Involvement: High** - Belief in God is generally protective against substance abuse and other negative behaviors.\n\nLooking at the examples, prior convictions, drug use, living alone, and age all have high or medium weights. The combination of these factors suggests a high risk of rearrest. However, education and being employed mitigate some risk, but not enough to lower the overall probability significantly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"Young age can increase recidivism due to fewer life experiences and potential for substance abuse or unstable behavior.\"),\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"High\", \"A prior conviction is a significant indicator of increased risk for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"Low\", \"While weight isn't strongly correlated with recidivism, being underweight might suggest health issues affecting behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"High\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness and may contribute to substance use or risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"Medium\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college shows some stability but doesn't protect against recidivism entirely.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"Low\", \"Employed one job; while having employment is protective, the examples didn't indicate a strong correlation with recidivism here.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"High\", \"Past four years of marijuana use is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential triggers and behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"Medium\", \"Living in a larger household might have different dynamics, but it's not directly linked to higher risk unless there are issues like drug abuse within the household.\"),\n    (\"God's Involvement\", \"High\", \"Belief in God is generally protective against substance abuse and other negative behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
