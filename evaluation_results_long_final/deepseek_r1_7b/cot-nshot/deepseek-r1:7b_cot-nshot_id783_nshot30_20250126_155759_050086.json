    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a 20-year-old White female. Let's go through her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a prior arrest and conviction, which is a significant risk factor. Prior convictions are usually linked to higher recidivism rates because they indicate past behavior that may lead to reoffending.\n\nShe weighs 115 lbs, which is quite underweight for her height of 5'4\". Underweight individuals often have weaker bones, leading to higher falls or fractures, contributing to rearrest.\n\nShe's married but living alone. Living with a spouse can provide support and stability, so this might actually be protective rather than a risk factor.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational barriers can limit opportunities for better job prospects and financial stability, which are linked to lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe's employed one job during the year. Employment is generally protective as it provides income and reduces dependency on substance use or other risky activities.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine. These substance abuse issues can lead to health problems, legal issues, and higher chances of reoffending in the future.\n\nShe feels no depression recently, which suggests she's mentally stable and less likely to engage in self-harming behaviors that could lead to her not seeking treatment or support.\n\nAt 20 years old, she was living with her biological mother in a household of five. This indicates living with an extended family, which is typically protective as it offers emotional support and stability compared to smaller households.\n\nShe believes God has no role in her personal events, but since she's White, this might be less relevant than other factors.\n\nConsidering all these factors: prior conviction (high risk), underweight (moderate risk related to health issues), living alone (protective), lack of education (moderate risk), job (protective), drug use history (high risk), no recent depression (protective), and family background (protective). \n\nOut of the high-risk factors, prior arrest, underweight, and drug use stand out. The other factors are either protective or have moderate risks. Since her prior arrest is a strong indicator, along with her drug use history, it's likely she has a higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"Individual has a prior arrest and conviction which indicates past behavior that may lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"underweight\", \"medium\", \"Her weight is significantly under for her height, possibly indicating health issues that could contribute to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can provide some stability but might not be as protective compared to other factors like education or employment.\"),\n    (\"no_high_school_diploma\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma and not enrolled in college can limit opportunities and increase risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\" employed_one_job\", \"low\", \"Employed one job during the year which provides income and reduces dependency on risky activities.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"Drug use history (marijuana and cocaine) is strongly associated with increased risk of reoffending due to potential health complications and legal issues.\"),\n    (\"no_recent_depression\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression which suggests mental stability and reduced likelihood of self-harming behaviors that could lead to not seeking treatment or support.\"),\n    (\"biological_mother_household_size_5\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of five, indicating family support which is typically protective.\"),\n    (\"god_no_role\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has no role in personal events; while this may indicate some level of independence, it's not directly linked to recidivism risk but could be influenced by family background and support network.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
