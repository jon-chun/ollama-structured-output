    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this Black male who's 20 years old. Let me break down all the risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of multiple arrests\u20144 times\u2014and being convicted. That's pretty significant; more arrests usually mean higher chances of reoffending because they've had previous experiences with law enforcement and the court system.\n\nHe's 6 feet 6 inches tall, but I don't think that directly affects his recidivism rate. However, it's a notable fact, though not sure how relevant it is here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence his support network; being alone might mean he doesn't have the same level of supervision or emotional support which could help him avoid further issues.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment often correlates with lower recidivism rates because having a degree provides skills and stability, so not having education is a strong risk factor.\n\nHe's never held a job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substance abuse, lack of income support, and increased vulnerability to poverty, all of which are linked to higher recidivism.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana from past four years. Drug use, especially without abstinence, can impair judgment, reduce self-control, and contribute to criminal behavior if it leads to substance abuse disorders or illegal activities.\n\nHe feels down a lot lately, indicating possible depression or emotional distress. Emotional instability can affect decision-making and relationships, increasing the risk of engaging in harmful behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with 7 people in his household. Larger households might provide more supervision but could also mean less direct parental involvement, especially if living alone now after being part of a larger family before.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his personal events suggests he may not seek spiritual guidance for negative experiences, which can lead to self-isolation and increased risk of engaging in problematic behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor like multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, emotional distress, and living situation contribute significantly to a high risk of rearrest. Therefore, I would predict a \"YES\" outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests (4 times)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate past involvement in the criminal system, which can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"No Education/GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education may lead to fewer opportunities and increased reliance on substance abuse, both of which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone reduces access to support networks that can provide guidance and resources to avoid further complications.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly without abstinence, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in harmful behaviors that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down a lot can lead to poor decision-making or substance abuse, both of which are risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 7 (7 people)\", \"low\", \"While larger households might provide more supervision, this individual is now living alone, reducing the potential supervision aspect.\"),\n    (\"Belief in No Role of God\", \"medium\", \"Lack of spiritual guidance may lead to self-isolation and increased risk of engaging in problematic behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
