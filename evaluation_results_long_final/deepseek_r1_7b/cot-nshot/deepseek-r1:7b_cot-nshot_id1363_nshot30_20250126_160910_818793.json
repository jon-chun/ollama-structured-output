    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this case to analyze. The person is a 22-year-old Black male with several risk factors that could influence his rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a high number of prior convictions, which usually indicates higher recidivism risk. So this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHis weight is 180 lbs, but more importantly, his educational status\u2014he has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. While having a GED can sometimes help, not being in school might mean he's less engaged with support systems and could be at higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's never married and living alone adds to the instability that can lead to substance abuse or other issues contributing to recidivism.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator of problematic behavior, which can lead to criminal activity again if not addressed.\n\nFeeling down for much of the month suggests emotional distress, which might correlate with substance abuse or other behavioral issues that could affect his future stability.\n\nLiving in an urban household with four adults who aren't biological parents shows he's in an environment where he might be exposed to different influences, possibly leading to unstable relationships or further substance use.\n\nConsidering all these factors together\u2014high prior convictions, lack of education, living situation, drug use, emotional distress\u2014the risk is quite high. I'm leaning towards a \"YES\" prediction with very high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of six arrests and one conviction, indicating a significant past involvement in the criminal system which increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"While he holds a GED, his lack of enrollment in college could indicate limited opportunities for further education or support services that might reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"high\", \"Living alone with no spouse despite being married suggests instability and potential lack of support network which can contribute to substance abuse or other unstable behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a significant risk factor for continued substance abuse, which can lead to further criminal behavior or involvement in the recidemic system.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for much of the month may indicate emotional distress, which could correlate with substance use issues or other behavioral problems that might contribute to future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological parents in an urban household of four suggests exposure to influences that could potentially lead to unstable relationships or further problematic behaviors contributing to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
