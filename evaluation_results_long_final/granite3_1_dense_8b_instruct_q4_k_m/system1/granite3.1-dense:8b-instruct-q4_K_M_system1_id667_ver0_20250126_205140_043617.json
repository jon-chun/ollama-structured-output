    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided suggest a low-risk profile for several reasons. Firstly, the individual is young (20 years old), which generally correlates with lower criminal recidivism rates. She has only been arrested once and convicted, indicating limited engagement in criminal activity. Her physical description does not suggest a propensity for violence or aggression.\n\nShe is currently enrolled in college and has held multiple jobs during the year, suggesting a degree of stability and structure in her life. Although she has used drugs in the past (marijuana and cocaine), her current use is intermittent and not intensive, which could suggest less severe addiction issues.\n\nHer social situation also indicates some level of support: she does not live alone but with others, which can provide a sense of responsibility and connection to the community. Her upbringing in a stable household with both parents until adulthood may have imparted positive values and behaviors.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information provided. Factors such as the nature of her conviction, specific details about her drug use, and any history of mental health issues are not available, which could potentially alter this assessment. The religious belief factor (considering God's involvement in personal matters) was also not provided, which could be a significant indicator in some risk assessments.",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 110 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
