    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided are analyzed based on statistical correlations with criminal behavior. In this case, the individual is a young male (21 years old), which generally correlates with higher risk due to brain development and impulsivity. However, there are several mitigating factors that lower the overall risk level.\n\nThe individual has been arrested once but not convicted, suggesting that he may have been involved in minor offenses or may be a victim of circumstances rather than a habitual offender. His employment history indicates stability and self-sufficiency, which are generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHis educational background (high school diploma) suggests some level of social integration and cognitive development, although not being enrolled in college might imply less future orientation or planning. His lack of depression over the past month and non-recent drug use (marijuana) also contribute to lowering the risk assessment, as substance abuse and mental health issues are often correlated with criminal behavior.\n\nHis upbringing in a large urban household might expose him to higher crime rates environmentally but does not necessarily indicate personal involvement. His current living arrangement (living alone) suggests some degree of self-reliance and stability, which can be protective factors against criminal involvement.\n\nThe individual's lack of religious belief might suggest less internalized moral constraints, potentially increasing risk, but this factor is not as strongly correlated with recidivism as others.\n\nOverall, while some risk factors are present, the combination of stable employment, no recent substance abuse, and lack of a criminal history lead to a lower-risk assessment in this case. The confidence level is moderate due to the complex interplay of these variables and individual-specific factors that might not be fully captured by statistical models.",
