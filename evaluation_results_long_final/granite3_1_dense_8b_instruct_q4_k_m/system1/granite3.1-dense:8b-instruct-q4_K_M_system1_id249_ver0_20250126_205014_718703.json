    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons:\n\n1. Age: At 19 years old, the individual is young and less likely to have a history of criminal behavior compared to older individuals.\n2. Arrests and Convictions: Although he has been arrested once and convicted, this number is relatively low, suggesting minimal involvement in serious crimes.\n3. Employment History: Holding multiple jobs during the year indicates stability and a willingness to work, which can lower recidivism risk.\n4. Education: Being enrolled in school suggests that he has goals for his future and is less likely to engage in criminal behavior.\n5. Marital Status: Not being married does not necessarily indicate higher risk; it simply reflects his current status.\n6. Residence: Living alone may increase the risk slightly, but it's offset by other factors like education and employment.\n7. Drug Use: Past drug use (marijuana) is a concern, but he has not used drugs in the past month, indicating potential abstinence.\n8. Depression: Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health, which can lower recidivism risk.\n9. Family Background: Growing up with both biological parents in an urban area may have provided a stable environment that reduces criminal propensity.\n10. Religious Beliefs: Believing that God has something to do with what happens to him personally might promote personal responsibility and lower recidivism risk.\n\nHowever, the confidence level is relatively low due to some concerning factors such as his weight (being overweight can indicate health issues), past drug use, and a single conviction. Overall, given these factors, this individual appears to present a lower risk for criminal behavior.",
