Age and gender: Being a young female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to older males.\n2. Criminal history: She has only been arrested once, without conviction, which suggests a lack of persistent criminal behavior.\n3. Education level: Her enrollment in a graduate program and having completed high school diploma indicates a higher level of education, often associated with lower risk.\n4. Employment history: Although she has held three jobs during the year, this is not necessarily indicative of instability, especially considering her age and ongoing education.\n5. Substance use: While past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) can be a risk factor, the fact that she does not feel depressed in the past month could indicate resilience or low dependency.\n6. Family background: Living with both biological parents in an urban area of size 6 household during childhood may have provided a stable upbringing.\n7. Religious beliefs: Identifying that God has something to do with personal life might suggest an internal moral compass and lower risk for criminal behavior.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is \"NO\" with a low confidence score of 20, as there are some aspects that could potentially increase risk (e.g., substance use) but overall, they do not strongly indicate high-risk behavior.",
