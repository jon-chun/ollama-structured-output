His single arrest without a conviction is also not indicative of a high risk for reoffending. His physical attributes (height, weight) do not contribute to risk assessment. Living situation (alone) can be a risk factor if the individual has a history of problematic relationships or substance abuse, but this information is not provided. His educational background (high school diploma and college enrollment) is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. Employment history (1 job in the past year) is not strongly correlated with reoffending risk. Drug use (marijuana) is a moderate risk factor, but his recent feelings of depression are more concerning. Living with both biological parents in a rural area during childhood is generally associated with lower risk. Religious belief (God has something to do with personal events) can be protective against criminal behavior. Overall, given the available information, this individual does not appear to be at high risk for reoffending. However, his recent depressive symptoms warrant further assessment and support services.",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
