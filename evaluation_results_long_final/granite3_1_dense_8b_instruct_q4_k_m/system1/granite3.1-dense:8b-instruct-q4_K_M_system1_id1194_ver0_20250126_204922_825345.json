    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a low to moderate risk level for several reasons. Firstly, the individual's age (19) and gender (male) do not significantly contribute to a high-risk profile. His arrest record is limited (1 time without conviction), suggesting he may not have a history of criminal behavior. His physical attributes (height and weight) are within normal ranges and do not indicate any risk factors. Living alone and not being married are also neutral factors.\n\nHis educational background (lack of high school diploma or GED, no current college enrollment) could potentially contribute to higher recidivism rates, but this is mitigated by his employment history (2 jobs in the past year), indicating some level of stability and responsibility. His absence of drug use and depression over the past month further reduces risk indicators.\n\nHis upbringing (urban area, single-parent household) could potentially suggest exposure to certain risks, but his religious beliefs (\"God has something to do with what happens to him personally\") may counteract this by providing a moral framework and potential support network. Overall, while there are some risk factors present, the absence of significant criminal history, recent substance use, or mental health issues suggests a lower risk profile.",
