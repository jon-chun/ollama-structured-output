    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a low-to-moderate risk level. Here's the reasoning:\n\n1. Age and gender (19-year-old female) - Generally, younger individuals and females tend to have lower recidivism rates than older males.\n2. Prior convictions - Although she has been convicted once, this is a single offense which may indicate a low risk for repeat offending.\n3. Physical characteristics (height, weight) - These factors do not provide strong predictive power in criminal justice risk assessments.\n4. Marital status and living arrangement - Living alone and never married can sometimes be associated with higher risks, but the overall impact is moderate.\n5. Education level (GED certificate) - Lower educational attainment can indicate a higher risk, but having a GED is still relatively positive compared to not completing high school.\n6. Employment history (3 jobs in a year) - Frequent job changes could suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which may be associated with higher risks. However, the number of jobs held does not necessarily indicate recidivism risk.\n7. Substance use history - Lack of drug use in the past four years is a positive factor as substance abuse can increase recidivism risk.\n8. Mental health (feelings of sadness) - Occasional feelings of depression do not necessarily correlate with higher criminal justice risks, but consistent patterns or severe symptoms might be concerning.\n9. Childhood environment - Growing up in a two-person household and an urban area does not provide strong predictive power for recidivism risk.\n10. Religious beliefs (lack of faith) - This factor has been debated among researchers, but it is generally considered to have moderate impact on criminal justice risk assessments.\n\nOverall, the combination of factors in this case suggests a low-to-moderate risk level, with the employment instability being the most concerning aspect. The confidence level is 60 due to the limited information provided and the absence of more predictive factors (e.g., detailed criminal history, mental health diagnosis, or substance abuse history).",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
