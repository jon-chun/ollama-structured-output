Living in an urban area at a young age is also associated with higher crime rates. While enrolling in school and having a job are generally positive factors, they do not outweigh the negative factors listed here. The individual's age (18) is at a critical period for criminal behavior. The race, marital status, height, weight, and religious beliefs did not significantly influence this assessment.",
