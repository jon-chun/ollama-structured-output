While the individual has a criminal history, he is relatively young and has not been arrested or convicted multiple times. His current education and employment status are positive indicators. Although he has used drugs in the past, he does not currently feel depressed, which can be a risk factor for future offenses. The absence of significant family history of criminal behavior and his religious beliefs also suggest a lower risk. However, given the individual's substance use history, there is still some concern for future risky behaviors.",
