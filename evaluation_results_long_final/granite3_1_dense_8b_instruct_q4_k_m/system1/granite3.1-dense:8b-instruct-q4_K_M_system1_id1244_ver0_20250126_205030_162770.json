    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low-risk individual for several reasons:\n1. Age and Gender: While age and gender alone don't determine risk, young males are often considered higher risk due to statistical trends in crime rates. However, the individual's specific characteristics suggest otherwise.\n2. Arrest History: One arrest without a conviction suggests the individual may not pose a significant ongoing risk.\n3. Substance Use: No drug use or alcohol abuse is indicated, which is a positive factor as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\n4. Mental Health: The absence of depression over the past month is a good indicator of mental well-being, reducing the risk of impulsive or self-destructive actions leading to crime.\n5. Employment: Holding down 2 jobs shows stability and commitment, which are generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n6. Education: Having completed high school but not attending college could indicate a level of disengagement from society, potentially increasing risk. However, the individual's overall profile suggests this factor is outweighed by others indicating low risk.\n7. Family Background: Living with a biological mother in an urban household of size 5 might suggest some familial instability or exposure to crime, but the absence of ongoing issues and the positive mental health status mitigate this risk factor.\n8. Religious Beliefs: Identifying as someone who believes God has a role in personal events can be associated with lower criminal risk, as it suggests a sense of moral or spiritual guidance.\n9. Social Situation: Living alone and not being married doesn't necessarily increase risk but also lacks factors that might indicate social support or commitment, which could potentially be beneficial in deterring criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, while some factors like age and gender suggest potential for higher risk, the individual's positive employment history, absence of substance abuse, good mental health, and religious beliefs outweigh these concerns, leading to a low-risk prediction with moderate confidence.",
