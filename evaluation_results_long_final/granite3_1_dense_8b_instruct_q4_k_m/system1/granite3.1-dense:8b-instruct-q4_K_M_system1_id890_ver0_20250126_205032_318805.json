The individual's history of two arrests and one conviction, past drug use (marijuana and cocaine), and recent feelings of depression are significant indicators of potential risk. Her young age, living alone, and the size of her household at a younger age can also contribute to risk factors. Despite her educational background and employment history, these other factors outweigh them in predicting high-risk behavior. The fact that she considers God has something to do with what happens to her personally suggests potential personal reflection or introspection, which could mitigate risk but is not strong enough to counterbalance the other indicators.",
