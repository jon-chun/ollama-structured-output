The individual is young, which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates. He has not been convicted of any crimes despite two arrests, indicating that the justice system may not view him as a significant threat. His physical health and lack of drug use are positive indicators. There's no recent depression or suicidal ideation, which can be risk factors for criminal behavior. He has stable employment history and is not enrolled in college, suggesting he's not overly disruptive to his routine. His upbringing in a two-parent household in an urban area is also a positive factor. The fact that he believes in a higher power could potentially indicate a moral or ethical framework. However, the lack of ongoing relationships (marriage, close family ties) and his solitary living situation could potentially increase risk slightly. Overall, based on these factors, the prediction is for low-to-moderate risk.",
