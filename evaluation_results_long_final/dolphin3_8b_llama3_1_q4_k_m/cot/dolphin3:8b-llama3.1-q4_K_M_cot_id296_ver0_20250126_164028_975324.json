He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
