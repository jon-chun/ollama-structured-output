He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area.
