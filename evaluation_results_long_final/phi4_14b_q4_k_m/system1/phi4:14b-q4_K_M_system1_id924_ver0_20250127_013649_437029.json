Additionally, the individual's belief system, indicating a lack of personal reliance on religion or spirituality, might correlate with lower levels of community support or moral guidance.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest an elevated risk profile, hence the prediction of \"YES\" for high risk. However, given the absence of current indicators such as ongoing drug use or mental health issues (e.g., depression), the confidence is set at 75%.",
