The confidence level reflects moderate certainty given the available data and common statistical associations.",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
