His demographics (White male) do not inherently indicate high risk.\n\n2. **Criminal Record**: He has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction does not strongly predict future criminal activity or recidivism.\n\n3. **Mental Health and Drug Use**: He reports feeling down in the dumps sometimes, which could suggest depressive symptoms. Additionally, past marijuana use is noted, though it's common among young adults and less predictive of severe risk unless associated with other factors like frequent heavy use or poly-drug abuse.\n\n4. **Social and Economic Factors**: Living alone and having only one job during the year might indicate instability but does not strongly suggest high-risk behavior on its own. Enrollment in school indicates some level of stability and engagement in constructive activities.\n\n5. **Religious Belief**: His statement about God not being involved in his life reflects personal belief rather than a risk factor unless it leads to behaviors that increase risk, which is not indicated here.\n\nOverall, while there are areas of concern (e.g., mental health symptoms), the combination of factors does not strongly indicate high risk for future criminal behavior or other severe negative outcomes. The confidence level reflects this moderate assessment with room for changes in circumstances or additional information.",

He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
