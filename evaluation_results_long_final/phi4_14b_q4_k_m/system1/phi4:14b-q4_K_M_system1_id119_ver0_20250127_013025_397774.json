Males have a slightly higher risk of reoffending than females but being young does not necessarily indicate high risk in isolation.\n\n2. **Arrest Record**: He has been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests that there may be some interaction with law enforcement, but it doesn't establish a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Education and Employment**: He is enrolled in a 4-year college program and holds one job within the year, indicating engagement in positive social structures like education and employment. These factors generally lower risk.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) does raise concerns; however, without current usage or dependency issues reported, this is not necessarily indicative of high risk at present.\n\n5. **Family and Living Situation**: Growing up in a stable family environment with both biological parents can be protective. Currently living alone doesn't inherently increase risk unless coupled with other negative factors such as social isolation or lack of support.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: No feelings of depression over the past month suggest no current mental health issues contributing to potential criminal behavior.\n\n7. **Religious Belief**: His belief that \"God has something to do with what happens to him personally\" may provide a moral framework and sense of accountability, potentially reducing risk.\n\n**Confidence Level**: The analysis suggests that while there are some risk factors present (e.g., past drug use), the overall context indicates a lower likelihood of high-risk behavior at this time. Thus, confidence is moderate due to potential mitigating factors like education and stable upbringing.",
