However, being female typically associates with slightly lower recidivism rates than males.\n\n2. **Race:** Identifying as Black may correlate with systemic factors that increase observed risk levels due to biases within the criminal justice system.\n\n3. **Arrests and Convictions:** Having been arrested three times without convictions suggests repeated encounters with law enforcement, which can be a risk factor even if not resulting in conviction.\n\n4. **Education Level:** Lack of a high school diploma or GED places her at higher risk due to lower educational attainment being correlated with increased criminal activity.\n\n5. **Employment History:** Holding multiple jobs in one year indicates instability, a potential risk factor for recidivism.\n\n6. **Substance Use:** Past use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor as drug use is often linked with re-offending.\n\n7. **Living Situation:** Not living alone can be protective; however, the stability and nature of her current living arrangement are unknown, which may contribute to risk.\n\n8. **Religious Beliefs:** A perceived lack of religious affiliation or belief in a higher power might correlate with lower adherence to societal norms that discourage criminal behavior.\n\n9. **Past Environment:** Growing up in an urban environment and within a small household size can be associated with certain stressors, though these are mitigated by factors such as not currently feeling depressed.\n\nOverall, while some factors suggest a protective influence (e.g., never being convicted), the cumulative effect of the other risk indicators leads to a moderate-to-high risk prediction. The confidence level reflects this assessment given the mixed nature of the risk factors involved.",
