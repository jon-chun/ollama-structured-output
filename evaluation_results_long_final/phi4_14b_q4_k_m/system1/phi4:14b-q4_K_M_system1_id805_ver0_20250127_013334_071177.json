While this indicates some engagement in criminal activity, the number of convictions is relatively low.\n\n3. **Education and Employment**: Holding a high school diploma and being enrolled in college are positive indicators. Having held multiple jobs can suggest adaptability but may also reflect instability.\n\n4. **Substance Use**: No drug use in the past four years is a strong protective factor.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: Experiencing feelings of depression (\"down in the dumps\") suggests mental health concerns, which could be a risk factor if untreated.\n\n6. **Family and Beliefs**: Growing up in an intact family with religious beliefs may provide social support and moral guidance, potentially reducing risk.\n\n7. **Living Situation**: Currently living alone can indicate independence but might also suggest lack of immediate social support.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors (criminal history, mental health concerns), there are significant protective factors (education, no recent drug use, religious beliefs) suggesting a moderate to low overall risk. The confidence is set at 75 due to the balance between risk and protective factors.",
