This suggests a lower risk compared to someone with multiple convictions or ongoing criminal activity.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics**: Height and weight are not significant predictors in this context.\n\n5. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Being unmarried and living alone does not inherently increase risk, although social support can be a factor in rehabilitation.\n\n6. **Education and Employment**: The individual is pursuing higher education (a 2-year college) and has held multiple jobs over the past year, indicating stability and commitment to positive societal contributions.\n\n7. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use does not automatically indicate high risk unless it is part of a broader pattern of substance abuse or associated with criminal activity.\n\n8. **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed in the past month suggests stable mental health, which is generally a protective factor against recidivism.\n\n9. **Family and Background**: Growing up in a rural household does not typically correlate with high risk unless there are other adverse factors present.\n\nOverall, while some factors such as ethnicity may require careful consideration to avoid bias, the individual's education, employment status, lack of recent drug use or depression, and limited criminal history suggest a lower risk profile. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the need for more comprehensive data on personal circumstances and potential biases in reporting or assessment systems.",
