Younger individuals generally have a higher potential for rehabilitation.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: Only one arrest and conviction suggest limited involvement with the criminal justice system, indicating lower risk compared to repeat offenders.\n\n3. **Employment Stability**: Holding two jobs within a year shows some level of stability and responsibility in her adult life.\n\n4. **Family Situation**: Being married and living with her spouse suggests stable personal relationships, which can be protective factors against recidivism.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: While past marijuana use is noted, there is no current indication of ongoing or problematic drug use.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: She has not felt depressed recently, suggesting a stable mental health status at the moment.\n\n7. **Education and Personal Beliefs**: Possessing a high school diploma indicates some level of educational attainment. Her belief that God influences her life might contribute positively to personal resilience.\n\nThe confidence is set at 75, acknowledging these positive indicators while considering unknown variables such as the nature of the conviction or unreported factors. The overall assessment leans towards a lower risk due to the presence of several mitigating factors.",
