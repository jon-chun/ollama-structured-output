Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors for recidivism.\n\n5. **Social Support and Beliefs**: Living alone could be a concern regarding social support, but having spiritual beliefs (\"God has something to do with what happens\") might provide some personal guidance or community connection.\n\n6. **Education and Background**: Having completed high school is generally positive, although not pursuing further education may limit opportunities. The stable household size during early years does not indicate significant risk.\n\nOverall, while there are certain areas of concern (e.g., employment), the combination of factors such as limited criminal history, no substance abuse, good mental health status, and spiritual beliefs suggest a lower risk profile compared to someone with more adverse indicators. The confidence level is set at 75 due to some uncertainties around employment and social support that could influence future behavior.",
