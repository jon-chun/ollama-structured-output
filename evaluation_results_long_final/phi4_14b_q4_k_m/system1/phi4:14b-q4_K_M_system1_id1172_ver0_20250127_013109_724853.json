Being unmarried and living alone could indicate less social support.\n\n6. **Religious Beliefs**: The belief that God has control over personal events might suggest limited perceived self-efficacy in changing outcomes through personal actions.\n\n7. **Household Size**: Growing up in a household of four does not strongly correlate with high risk unless other negative factors were present (not specified here).\n\nGiven these considerations, the combination of demographic factors, criminal history, substance use, and lack of employment suggests a higher risk profile. However, some mitigating factors exist, such as education level and absence of depression, leading to moderate confidence in this assessment.",
