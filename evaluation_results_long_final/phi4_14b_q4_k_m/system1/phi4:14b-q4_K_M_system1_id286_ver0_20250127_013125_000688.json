His race and gender are noted but without additional context or evidence of bias.\n  \n- **Criminal History:** He has been arrested once but not convicted, suggesting limited interaction with the justice system.\n\n- **Living Situation:** Living alone and never married might indicate less social support, but it does not inherently suggest high risk.\n\n- **Education and Employment:** Enrollment in a 4-year college and holding two jobs are positive indicators of stability and future prospects.\n\n- **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning, but the lack of recent depression or escalation suggests control over this behavior.\n\n- **Background:** Early life with non-biological adults could indicate past instability, but his current educational pursuits mitigate this risk.\n\n- **Religious Beliefs:** His belief in a higher power may provide personal guidance and support.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors, the individual's current stability and future prospects suggest a lower risk of reoffending. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty given the available data.",
