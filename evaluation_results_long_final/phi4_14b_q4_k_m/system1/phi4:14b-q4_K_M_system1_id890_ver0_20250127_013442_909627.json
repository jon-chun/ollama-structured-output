However, being female may slightly lower the risk compared to males in certain contexts.\n\n2. **Criminal History:** Two arrests with convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, contributing to a higher risk assessment.\n\n3. **Substance Use:** Past use of marijuana and cocaine is significant, as substance abuse can correlate with recidivism and other risky behaviors.\n\n4. **Mental Health:** Experiencing depressive symptoms (\"felt so down in the dumps\") suggests potential mental health issues, which are risk factors for future criminal behavior or negative outcomes.\n\n5. **Social and Economic Factors:**\n   - Never married and living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support systems.\n   - Employment history shows some stability (three jobs), but frequent changes can suggest instability.\n   - Education level is at an associate/junior college, which might limit economic opportunities compared to higher education levels.\n\n6. **Background:** Growing up in an urban area with a household size of five could have exposed her to environments where crime and substance use are more prevalent.\n\n7. **Religious Belief:** Considering that God has something to do with personal events may provide some protective factor, but its impact is subjective and varies greatly among individuals.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n- The prediction of \"YES\" for high risk is based on the combination of criminal history, substance use, mental health concerns, and social factors. However, there are mitigating aspects like her employment history and religious beliefs that temper the overall assessment. Thus, a confidence level of 75 reflects a moderate to high certainty in this prediction.",
