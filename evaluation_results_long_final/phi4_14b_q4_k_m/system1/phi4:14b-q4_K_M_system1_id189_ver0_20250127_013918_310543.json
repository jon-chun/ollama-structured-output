This suggests involvement in situations that led to arrests but not sufficient evidence or admission of guilt to secure convictions.\n\n3. **Marital Status:** Being married and living with a spouse can be stabilizing factors, often associated with reduced risk of reoffending.\n\n4. **Education and Employment:** Having completed high school is positive, though lack of current employment could contribute to financial stress, which might influence behavior negatively if not managed properly.\n\n5. **Substance Use:** Past marijuana use in the last four years suggests some level of substance involvement but doesn't necessarily indicate a current or escalating risk unless accompanied by other factors such as dependency or legal issues related to drug use.\n\n6. **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator, suggesting no immediate mental health concerns that might elevate risk levels.\n\n7. **Family and Beliefs:** Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents present could be seen as a protective factor against some risks. Additionally, religious beliefs can provide personal guidance and support systems, potentially reducing the likelihood of reoffending.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to the mixed nature of risk factors\u2014some indicating potential concerns (age, lack of employment) while others are mitigating (marital status, education, religious beliefs). Without more severe indicators like violent behavior or recent criminal activity, a high-risk prediction isn't strongly supported.",
