However, holding three jobs in one year might suggest instability or financial stress.\n\n- **Substance Use**: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially if there's recent usage.\n\n- **Mental Health**: Feeling down consistently can indicate depression, which may contribute to higher risk levels if not addressed.\n\n- **Family Background**: Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents might have mixed implications depending on the family dynamics and environment.\n\n- **Religious Beliefs**: A lack of religious affiliation or belief that God does not influence personal life could correlate with certain risk factors, though this is less direct.\n\nGiven these considerations, there are several concerning elements (substance use, mental health issues) that suggest a higher risk level. However, the presence of some protective factors (education, employment) tempers this assessment slightly, leading to a moderate confidence in predicting high risk.",
