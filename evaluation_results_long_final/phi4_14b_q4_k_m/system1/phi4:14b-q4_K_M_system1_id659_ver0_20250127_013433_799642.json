Her history of nine arrests and convictions is significant, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n2. **Socioeconomic Factors**: She has held only one job in the past year, suggesting potential instability or difficulty maintaining employment. This can be linked to higher risk as stable employment is often associated with lower recidivism.\n\n3. **Substance Use**: Past drug use (marijuana) indicates a potential for substance abuse issues, which are correlated with increased criminal behavior and recidivism.\n\n4. **Living Situation**: Not living alone might provide some social support, but it also suggests dependency or lack of independent living skills, factors that can contribute to higher risk.\n\n5. **Education and Beliefs**: While she has a high school diploma, not being enrolled in further education may limit her opportunities for advancement and stability. Additionally, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens personally might indicate a lack of spiritual or moral guidance, which some studies suggest can be protective against criminal behavior.\n\n6. **Psychological Factors**: Not feeling depressed over the past month is positive, but it does not provide comprehensive insight into her mental health status.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest a higher risk profile, though with moderate confidence due to potential mitigating factors like lack of recent depression and current living situation providing some support.",
