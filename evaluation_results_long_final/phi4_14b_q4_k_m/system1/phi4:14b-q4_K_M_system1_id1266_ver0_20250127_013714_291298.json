Currently living alone may indicate lack of social support.\n\n8. **Religious Belief:** While this factor is more subjective, it can impact behavior positively if associated with community involvement, but its influence on risk assessment without further context is limited.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests a higher level of risk, though confidence isn't absolute due to the complexity and interplay of socio-economic, psychological, and behavioral variables. Hence, a confidence score of 75 reflects a substantial degree of certainty based on known risk indicators.",
