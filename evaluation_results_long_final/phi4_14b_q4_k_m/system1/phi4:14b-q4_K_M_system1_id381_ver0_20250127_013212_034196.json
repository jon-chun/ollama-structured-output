Holding a job also suggests some level of responsibility.\n\n4. **Substance Use:** Past marijuana use is noted, which can be a risk factor but is relatively common among young adults and not necessarily indicative of high risk unless it leads to significant impairment or legal issues.\n\n5. **Mental Health:** Experiencing feelings of depression (\"down in the dumps\") is concerning and could indicate potential for future risk if untreated, but alone does not confirm high risk without additional context (e.g., suicidal ideation).\n\n6. **Family Background and Beliefs:** A stable upbringing with both biological parents and religious beliefs can be protective factors.\n\n7. **Living Situation:** Living alone at a young age might suggest independence or instability; however, it is not necessarily indicative of high risk without further negative indicators.\n\nOverall, while there are some concerning elements (e.g., past drug use, mental health issues), the presence of several stabilizing factors (education, employment, religious beliefs) leads to a prediction of \"NO\" for high risk with moderate confidence.",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
