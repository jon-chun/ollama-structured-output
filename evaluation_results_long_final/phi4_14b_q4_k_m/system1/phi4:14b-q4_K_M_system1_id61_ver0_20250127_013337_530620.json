Key considerations include:\n\n- **Age and Demographics**: At 22, the individual is young but not in the highest-risk age bracket for recidivism.\n  \n- **Criminal History**: He has only one arrest with no convictions, indicating minimal prior involvement with the justice system.\n\n- **Socioeconomic Factors**: He is pursuing higher education (enrolled in a 4-year college), which generally correlates with lower risk levels. Lack of employment might be due to educational commitments rather than criminal intent.\n\n- **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use does not significantly elevate risk without indications of heavier or more dangerous drug involvement.\n\n- **Mental Health and Support**: No recent depression and belief in a higher power may provide personal resilience and support networks, potentially mitigating risk factors.\n\nOverall, while some areas like lack of employment could be monitored, the combination of these factors suggests a lower likelihood of high-risk behavior. The confidence level is set at 75 to account for uncertainties inherent in assessing future behaviors based on limited data.",
