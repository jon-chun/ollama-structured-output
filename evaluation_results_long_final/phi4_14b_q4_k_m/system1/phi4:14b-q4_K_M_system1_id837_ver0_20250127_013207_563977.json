Additionally, strong personal religious beliefs could influence behavior positively or negatively depending on how they are integrated into daily life.\n\nOverall, these factors collectively suggest an elevated risk level, though the absence of some more severe indicators (e.g., violent crime history) tempers the confidence slightly.",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
