Occasional use without escalation may not significantly increase risk.\n\n6. **Mental Health:** No recent feelings of depression reduce concerns about mental health-related risks.\n\n7. **Family Background and Beliefs:**\n   - Growing up in a rural area with both biological parents is generally considered a stable environment.\n   - Spiritual beliefs indicating that God has a role in personal outcomes can suggest a positive outlook or coping mechanism, though this is subjective.\n\n**Conclusion:** The combination of factors suggests moderate stability with some potential risk elements (e.g., age, gender, substance use). However, the absence of convictions, recent mental health issues, and a generally stable background lead to a lower overall risk prediction. The confidence level reflects this assessment, acknowledging that while some factors could increase risk, they are not overwhelmingly present or severe in this case.",
