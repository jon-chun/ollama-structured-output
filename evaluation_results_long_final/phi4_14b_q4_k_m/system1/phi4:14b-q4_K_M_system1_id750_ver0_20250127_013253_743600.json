The demographic information (e.g., race, gender) does not inherently indicate high risk.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: He has been arrested once without any convictions. A single arrest without conviction suggests lower recidivism risk compared to individuals with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics**: While his physical build is notable, there's no direct correlation between height/weight and criminal behavior in the context provided.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Being unmarried and living alone might indicate a lack of social support but isn't necessarily a strong predictor of high risk without other negative indicators.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: Enrollment in school and holding two jobs show positive engagement with society, suggesting lower risk compared to those unemployed or not engaged in education.\n\n6. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use is noted, but there's no indication of current drug abuse, which would be a stronger risk factor.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: Absence of depression over the past month indicates better mental health stability at this time.\n\n8. **Family and Beliefs**: Growing up with both parents in an urban area might have exposed him to different social influences but also provided some level of family support. His belief in a higher power can be associated with positive behavioral guidance.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could be concerning (such as past drug use), the individual's engagement in school and employment, lack of convictions, and current mental health stability suggest he is not at high risk for future criminal behavior. The confidence level reflects the balance between these mitigating factors and potential concerns.",
