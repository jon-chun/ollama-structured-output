Males in this age group statistically have a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\n2. **Race/Ethnicity**: Identifying as Black may correlate with systemic biases that can affect arrest rates and risk assessments.\n\n3. **Arrest Record**: Although there has been one arrest without conviction, any history of legal trouble is often considered a potential risk factor.\n\n4. **Socioeconomic Status**: Living alone, not being married, having held only one job in the past year, and lacking higher education may indicate economic instability or limited social support networks.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: Past use of marijuana and cocaine can be indicative of behavioral patterns that might increase risk.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: Although he has not felt depressed recently, drug use history could correlate with other mental health challenges.\n\n7. **Family Background**: Growing up in a larger urban household with his biological mother might suggest exposure to certain environmental stressors common in urban settings.\n\n8. **Belief System**: His belief that God influences personal outcomes suggests reliance on external factors for control, which may or may not affect risk assessment depending on the context.\n\nGiven these considerations and without additional mitigating information, there are several indicators pointing towards a higher risk profile. However, the confidence is moderate (65) due to limited data on key aspects like current behavioral patterns and social support systems outside of those mentioned.",
