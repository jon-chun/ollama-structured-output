His physical size (6 feet 2 inches, 275 lbs) may also suggest potential for violent behavior.\n\n4. **Employment Stability:** Holding only two jobs during the year indicates some instability or lack of commitment, which can be a risk factor.\n\n5. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** While being married might typically reduce risk, it is not a strong protective factor on its own, especially if other risk factors are present.\n\n6. **Religious Belief:** Considering that God has something to do with personal events may indicate a reliance on external control rather than internal locus of control, which can be associated with higher risk behaviors.\n\nThe confidence level of 75 reflects the presence of multiple moderate-risk factors but acknowledges that not all indicators point strongly towards high risk.",
