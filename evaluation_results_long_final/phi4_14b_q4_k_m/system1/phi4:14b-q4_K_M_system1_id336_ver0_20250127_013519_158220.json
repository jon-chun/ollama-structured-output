This indicates a relatively low level of interaction with the criminal justice system.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Being unmarried and living alone is common for his age group and doesn't inherently indicate high risk.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: Having a high school diploma and holding two jobs suggests some degree of stability and responsibility.\n\n6. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use is noted, but without current use or legal issues related to it, this does not significantly elevate risk.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: No recent feelings of depression suggest no immediate mental health concerns contributing to risk.\n\n8. **Family Background**: Growing up in a household of five in an urban area can present challenges, but the information provided doesn't indicate a high-risk environment.\n\n9. **Religious Belief**: A belief that God has something to do with personal events can be seen as a positive coping mechanism and does not contribute to risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that might raise concern in different contexts, the combination of these factors suggests no immediate or substantial indication of high risk. The confidence level reflects this assessment but acknowledges potential limitations in available data.",
