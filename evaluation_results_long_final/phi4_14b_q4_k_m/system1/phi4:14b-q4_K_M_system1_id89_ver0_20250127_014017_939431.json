Having a high school diploma also indicates completed basic education.\n- **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators for lower risk.\n- **Family Background:** Growing up in a household with both biological parents may suggest a stable upbringing, despite being an urban setting.\n\nThe absence of high-risk behaviors or markers such as convictions, drug use, mental health issues, or unstable living conditions contributes to the assessment. The prediction is \"NO\" for high risk, with moderate confidence due to limited information on potential future behavior changes or external influences.",
