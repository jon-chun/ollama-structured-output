He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
