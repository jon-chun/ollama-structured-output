These suggest some level of risk but are not overwhelming in their impact.\n- Factors such as education level, employment status, mental health, family structure, and religious belief are weighted as low risks, indicating protective elements against recidivism.\n- Drug use is a medium risk factor due to its potential for contributing to criminal behavior, though it's mitigated by the lack of recent use or substance abuse issues.\n- The confidence level is set at 65, reflecting the mixed nature of the risk factors present. While there are several protective factors, the moderate risks cannot be ignored, and past examples show that similar profiles have resulted in rearrests. This prediction errs on the side of caution, acknowledging the complexity of predicting human behavior.",
