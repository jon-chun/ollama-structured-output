The confidence in this prediction is set at 75% due to the combination of some high-risk factors (e.g., one arrest, drug use, living alone) and mitigating factors (e.g., education, no depression, belief in no divine intervention). It's important to note that while statistical models like these can provide insights, they are only a part of the complex picture that should be considered alongside professional judgment and individual circumstances.",
