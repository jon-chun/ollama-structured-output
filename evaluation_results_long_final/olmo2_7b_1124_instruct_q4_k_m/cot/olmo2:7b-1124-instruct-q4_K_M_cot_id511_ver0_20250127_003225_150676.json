The prediction leans towards a recidivism risk due to several significant factors such as past arrest, conviction, and history of drug use, despite other mitigating factors like education and belief in a higher power which could offer some level of protection against recidivism. The confidence level is set at 70% to reflect the complexity of predicting human behavior and the presence of multiple influential factors.",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
