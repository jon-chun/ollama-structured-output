Each factor is assigned a relative weight based on its general influence on recidivism, and these weights are combined to predict the likelihood of reoffense over a 3-year period. The prediction leans towards a \"YES\" due to the combination of low to high-risk factors, but the confidence score indicates that while it's more likely than not, there is still a substantial degree of uncertainty.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs between 100 and 124 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year.
