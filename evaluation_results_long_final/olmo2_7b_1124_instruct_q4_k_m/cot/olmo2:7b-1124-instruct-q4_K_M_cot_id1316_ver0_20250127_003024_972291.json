While living with a spouse can offer stability, the lack of employment indicates potential financial stressors and free time for possible criminal activity.\n* **Education Level:** Low risk. Education is often linked to higher socioeconomic status and reduced criminal tendencies due to better life skills and opportunities.\n* **Employment Status:** High risk. Unemployment can lead to boredom, increased social isolation, and higher propensity for engaging in criminal behavior for income generation.\n* **Drug Use:** Medium risk. Current drug use could impair decision-making and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\n* **Depressive Symptoms:** Medium risk. Depression can affect judgment and increase the propensity for impulsive and potentially criminal behavior.\n\n**Prediction:** The combination of these factors suggests a higher probability of rearrest within 3 years, leading to a prediction of \"YES\" recidivism.\n\n**Confidence:** Given the aggregate weight of these risk factors, a confidence level of 75% is appropriate, reflecting a strong likelihood but not absolute certainty.",
