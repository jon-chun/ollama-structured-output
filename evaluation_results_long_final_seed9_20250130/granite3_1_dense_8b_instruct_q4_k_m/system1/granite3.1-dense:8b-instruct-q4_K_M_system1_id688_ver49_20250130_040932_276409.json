    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a low-to-moderate risk level. Here's why:\n\n1. Age (21) and gender (female) alone do not significantly contribute to high recidivism rates.\n2. One prior arrest with no prior convictions suggests a relatively minor offense or first-time offender.\n3. Physical attributes like height and weight are neutral risk factors.\n4. Marital status and living arrangements (never married, lives alone) do not significantly impact recidivism rates.\n5. Educational background (associate/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college) generally indicates lower risk due to prosocial behavior and future opportunities.\n6. Employment history (1 job held during the year) is relatively stable, suggesting lower risk.\n7. Past drug use (marijuana) may indicate some substance abuse issues but does not significantly raise the risk level when considered alone.\n8. Absence of depression over the past month reduces the risk associated with mental health concerns.\n9. Growing up in a 4-person household is generally neutral as far as recidivism rates are concerned.\n10. Belief in a higher power (God) can be associated with lower risk due to potential prosocial influences, although this factor's impact may vary among individuals.\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall risk level is relatively low, but there are some substance abuse and employment concerns that could be monitored closely. The confidence in this prediction is moderate (65) because individual responses to these factors can vary significantly, and additional context might influence the assessment.",
