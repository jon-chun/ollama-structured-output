The individual is relatively young, has had only one arrest and conviction, and does not have a history of depression or substance abuse issues. She is also educated and employed, which are generally protective factors against criminal behavior. However, the use of drugs in the past four years (marijuana) could potentially indicate a higher risk, but this factor alone does not seem to outweigh the other mitigating factors. The confidence level is low due to the limited information provided.",
