The individual's age (21), gender, and race (White) are not typically associated with high crime rates. Her criminal history is limited to one arrest and one conviction, which suggests a low level of recidivism. She has no history of depression or drug abuse in the past month, and her use of marijuana in the past four years does not indicate recent problematic behavior. Her educational background (associate/junior college and currently enrolled in a 2-year college) suggests stability and future orientation. She has held a job for the year, indicating employment stability. Her living situation (living alone) is not necessarily a risk factor. However, her religious belief could potentially influence positive behavior and deter criminal activity. Despite these factors, the confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information provided about the nature of her offense and other potential risk factors.",
