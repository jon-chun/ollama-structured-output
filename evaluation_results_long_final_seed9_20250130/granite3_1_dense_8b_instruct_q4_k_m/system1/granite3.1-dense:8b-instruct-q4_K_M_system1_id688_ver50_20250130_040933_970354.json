The individual's age, gender, and race are not significant predictors of criminal behavior. Her low number of prior arrests and convictions, along with her current educational pursuits and employment history, suggest a lower likelihood of reoffending. The absence of depression and substance abuse issues in the recent past further reduces risk. While living in a household of four at a young age could potentially indicate exposure to instability or dysfunction, this factor alone does not significantly contribute to high-risk status. The individual's religious beliefs also do not typically correlate with increased criminal behavior. Therefore, the overall risk is considered low to moderate.",
