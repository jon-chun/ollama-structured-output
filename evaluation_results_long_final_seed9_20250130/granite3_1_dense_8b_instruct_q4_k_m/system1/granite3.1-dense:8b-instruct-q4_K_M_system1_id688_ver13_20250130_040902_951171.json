    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low risk for several reasons. Firstly, the individual's age (21) and gender (female) are generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to other demographics. She has a low number of prior arrests (1) and convictions, which is also indicative of lower risk. Her physical attributes (height and weight) do not contribute significantly to the assessment. Living situation (alone) can sometimes be associated with higher risk, but in this case, it may suggest independence and self-reliance. Her educational background (associate/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college) indicates motivation and future potential, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. Employment history (held 1 job during the year) suggests stability and responsibility.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years can be a risk factor, but its impact is mitigated by her lack of depression symptoms over the past month. Living in a household of size 4 at a young age could imply a stable family environment. Her religious beliefs (God has something to do with what happens to her personally) may contribute positively to her risk assessment, as research suggests that strong religious beliefs can be associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHowever, the confidence in this prediction is relatively low due to the limited information provided and the complexity of accurately predicting criminal behavior based on static factors alone.",
