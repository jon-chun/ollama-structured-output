    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons. First, the individual's age (21 years old) and gender are not typically associated with high criminal recidivism rates. She has only one prior arrest and conviction, which is also indicative of low risk. Her physical attributes do not present any unique risks. She has never been married and lives alone, suggesting a level of independence that can be protective against certain forms of criminal behavior.\n\nHer educational history (associate/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college) is associated with lower risk. Having held only one job during the year suggests stability, which can also indicate lower risk. Her drug use (marijuana) while concerning, does not necessarily predict high recidivism rates, especially given her lack of depression over the past month.\n\nHer upbringing in a household of four suggests a stable family environment during formative years, which can be protective against criminal behavior. Her religious beliefs may also serve as a deterrent to criminal activity. However, it's important to note that while these factors suggest lower risk, individual circumstances can vary greatly and this assessment is based solely on the provided information.\n\nThe confidence score is set at 60 due to the limited scope of information provided. A comprehensive assessment would consider additional factors such as detailed criminal history, substance use patterns, mental health status, social support network, employment stability, and more.",
