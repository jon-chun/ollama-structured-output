The person is young, with no history of multiple arrests or convictions. She has stable living arrangements and is currently enrolled in college, which can indicate a sense of responsibility and commitment. Her employment history shows only one job held during the year, suggesting stability. Although she has used drugs in the past four years, this is not an immediate risk factor as it does not indicate recent or frequent use. She reports no depression over the past month and comes from a relatively stable family background (a household of four). Her religious beliefs may also contribute to a sense of personal responsibility and morality. However, there are always individual circumstances that could influence risk assessment beyond these factors, which is why the confidence level is not higher.",
