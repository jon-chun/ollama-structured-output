The individual's age, gender, race, and marital status are not indicative of high risk. Her criminal history is limited to one arrest and conviction, which is also a low-risk factor. Her physical characteristics do not contribute significantly to the risk assessment. Her educational background and employment history indicate stability. She has used drugs in the past but does not currently feel depressed, which suggests she may have addressed any underlying issues contributing to her past substance use. Living with a small family at a young age and her religious beliefs also suggest a more stable upbringing. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based solely on the provided factors and does not account for other potential risk indicators not mentioned.",
