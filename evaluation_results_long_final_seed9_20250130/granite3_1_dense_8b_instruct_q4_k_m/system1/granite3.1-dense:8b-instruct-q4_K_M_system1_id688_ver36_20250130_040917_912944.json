The individual's age, ethnicity, and past arrests are not particularly alarming on their own. She has a single conviction, which is relatively low compared to multiple offenses. Her physical attributes (height and weight) do not indicate any specific risk factors. Living alone, being unmarried, and having completed some college education suggest stability. Having held one job during the year indicates employment, which can lower recidivism risk. The absence of depression over the past month is also a positive factor. Her upbringing in a household of four suggests a relatively stable family background. However, her past drug use (marijuana) could potentially indicate higher risk, but this is mitigated by the fact that she does not currently feel depressed. The belief in a personal relationship with God might also suggest lower risk due to potential positive influences on behavior.\n\nPlease note: This assessment is based solely on the provided information and does not take into account other potentially relevant factors or more detailed statistical analysis typically used in professional risk assessments.",
