Firstly, the individual's age (21) and gender are not typically associated with high recidivism rates. She has had only one arrest and conviction, which is indicative of limited criminal history. Her physical attributes do not pose any inherent risk. The fact that she is currently living alone suggests a degree of personal responsibility and stability. Her educational background indicates potential for prosocial engagement. Holding down a job for the year also points towards stability and commitment. Past drug use (marijuana) does not necessarily imply high risk, especially if it's isolated and not part of a pattern of substance abuse. Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health. Her upbringing in a household of four people may have fostered social skills and family values. Lastly, her religious belief can potentially contribute to positive coping mechanisms and moral deterrents against criminal behavior. Overall, while some factors could be considered if more context was provided, the combination of these factors suggests a low risk profile.",
