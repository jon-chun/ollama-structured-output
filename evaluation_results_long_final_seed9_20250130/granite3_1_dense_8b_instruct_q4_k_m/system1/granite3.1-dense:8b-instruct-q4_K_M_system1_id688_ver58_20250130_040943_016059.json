Her age (21) and gender (female) are generally associated with lower recidivism rates. She has only been arrested once, indicating limited criminal history. She is currently enrolled in college and employed, which can indicate stability and lower risk of reoffending. Her drug use is limited to marijuana, a less severe substance compared to others. She does not report feeling depressed, which can be a predictor of future criminal behavior. However, the confidence level is moderate due to the lack of information on the nature of her previous conviction and the absence of data on other potential risk factors such as substance abuse history, family criminal history, or antisocial attitudes.",
