    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate low to moderate risk for several reasons. First, the individual's age (21) and gender (female) are generally associated with lower recidivism rates. She has a single arrest and conviction, which is not extensive. Her physical characteristics do not contribute significantly to risk assessment. Living alone and never being married can sometimes indicate increased independence and self-sufficiency, potentially lowering risk. Education, specifically college enrollment, is often associated with reduced recidivism. Having held only one job in the past year could suggest stability or limited opportunities, neither of which strongly indicates high risk. Her past drug use (marijuana) does not necessarily point to current substance abuse issues, especially since she has not felt depressed recently. Living in a household of four at a young age can sometimes indicate exposure to positive social influences. Lastly, her religious beliefs might contribute to personal resilience and coping mechanisms, potentially lowering risk. However, it's important to note that no single factor definitively predicts recidivism, and individual circumstances may vary significantly. The confidence level is estimated based on these considerations.",
