Factors such as young age, single adult status, limited criminal history (1 arrest and conviction), educational attainment and enrollment, stable employment, non-recent drug use (marijuana use over four years ago), absence of depression symptoms in the past month, and a supportive family background (living with siblings at a young age) all contribute to this assessment. However, it's essential to note that risk assessments are not an exact science, and individual circumstances can vary widely. This confidence score reflects the general likelihood based on typical patterns observed in criminal justice research but should not be considered definitive for any specific individual.",
