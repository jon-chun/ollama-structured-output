The individual is young, has no history of multiple arrests or convictions, and has completed some college education, which can be associated with lower recidivism rates. She also does not report feelings of depression and has only used marijuana in the past four years, suggesting limited substance abuse issues. The fact that she holds a job and lives alone indicates self-sufficiency and stability. The size of her household at a young age is average, and her religious beliefs may contribute to a sense of personal responsibility and moral guidance. However, the single arrest and conviction are concerning, but they do not overcome the overall low risk profile suggested by other factors. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.",
