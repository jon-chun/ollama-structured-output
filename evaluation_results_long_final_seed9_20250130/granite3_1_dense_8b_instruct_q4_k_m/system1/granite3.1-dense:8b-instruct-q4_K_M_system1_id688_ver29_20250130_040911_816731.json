Her education level suggests potential for future stability. The use of drugs in the past four years does not indicate recent substance abuse, and there are no signs of depression or feelings of hopelessness. However, her height and weight do not significantly impact risk assessment, nor does her religious belief. The fact that she has lived alone for some time could suggest independence and self-reliance, which may reduce risk. Despite the lack of marriage or family support, the overall picture indicates a low risk level, but with room for improvement given her relatively young age.",
