The individual's age, gender, marital status, and current living situation are not typically associated with high recidivism rates. Her educational background and employment history also suggest stability. The absence of recent depression and substance abuse (except for past marijuana use) is a positive indicator. While her family size and religious beliefs could potentially be relevant in other contexts, they do not stand out as high-risk factors based on the provided information. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence of 65%.",
