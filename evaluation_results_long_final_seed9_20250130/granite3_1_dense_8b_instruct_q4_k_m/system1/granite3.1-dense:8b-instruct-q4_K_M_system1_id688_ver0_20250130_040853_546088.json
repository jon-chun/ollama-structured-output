    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for recidivism. The individual's young age, lack of multiple arrests or convictions, and current enrollment in college suggest lower risk. Her employment history and lack of depression also contribute to this assessment. However, her drug use (marijuana) is a factor that could potentially indicate higher risk, but the recency and frequency are not specified, which limits its weight in this analysis. The absence of family or marital support might be a minor concern, but her strong religious belief could mitigate this. Overall, given the information provided, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.",
