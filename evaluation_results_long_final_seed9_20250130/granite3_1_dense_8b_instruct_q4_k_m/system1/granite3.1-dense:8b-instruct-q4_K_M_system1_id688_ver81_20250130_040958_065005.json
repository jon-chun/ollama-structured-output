While the individual has a history of drug use and a single arrest, these factors are not severe or frequent enough to suggest a significant risk of reoffending. Additionally, the individual's education level, employment status, and lack of depression symptoms are generally associated with lower risk. The absence of family history of criminal behavior also contributes to this assessment. However, it is important to note that predicting recidivism is complex and multifaceted, and no single set of factors can definitively determine high or low risk.",
