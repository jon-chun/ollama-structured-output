    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've been given this task to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, her age is 21, which might be considered on the younger side, but it's also important because younger individuals often have different needs and recidivism rates can vary. She has a White racial background\u2014I wonder if there are any systemic issues affecting her, like over-policing or socioeconomic disparities.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That's significant because prior convictions increase the risk of reoffending. The more convictions you have, the higher the chances of getting involved again.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like weight or height directly affect recidivism unless there are issues with substance use, which she has a history of marijuana use over the past four years.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living in a single environment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors if there are underlying issues, but it also depends on other factors like mental health or support systems.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently enrolled in a 2-year program. Education level can influence recidivism; generally, higher education might correlate with lower risk as people may have better opportunities and skills. However, sometimes lack of motivation can offset that.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year. Employment stability is a factor\u2014if someone isn't employed or has inconsistent work, it could lead to higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nDrug use: she admitted to marijuana use in the past four years. That's concerning because substance abuse often leads to other criminal behaviors and can impair judgment.\n\nMental health: she hasn't felt depressed over the past month. But prior drug use might have affected her mental state, which could influence recidivism.\n\nHousehold size at a young age was 4\u2014so living with siblings or relatives who might have supported her differently in the past could be a factor if there's dependency on family for support now.\n\nBelief in God: she thinks God is involved in her life. While that's a personal belief, it can sometimes correlate with higher moral values and less involvement in risky activities, but it's not always consistent.\n\nPutting this all together, the prior arrest and conviction are high factors because they indicate past behavior that could lead to similar future actions. Drug use is medium or maybe high if it's influencing her current decisions. Living alone without support might be a medium risk factor depending on other circumstances.\n\nHer education level might mitigate some of these risks as she's actively pursuing further education, but only one job might not provide enough stability.\n\nConsidering all this, the prior offense history seems like the strongest indicator. The drug use and living situation could add to that risk. Her age is a bit of an outlier, making it harder to assess conclusively.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"Her one prior arrest and one conviction significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending due to past behavior patterns.\"),\n    (\"marijuana_use\", \"medium\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which can influence substance abuse behaviors that may lead to criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"single_residence\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a strong support network could increase risk factors such as isolation or unstable environments affecting decision-making.\"),\n    (\"education_and Employment\", \"low\", \"While she has an associate/junior college education and is enrolled in a 2-year program, her holding only one job during the year may indicate limited financial stability and potential for risky behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
