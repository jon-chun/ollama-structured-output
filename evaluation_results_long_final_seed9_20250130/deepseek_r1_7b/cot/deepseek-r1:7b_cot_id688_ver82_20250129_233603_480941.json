    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Being in her late teens can be a double-edged sword. While she's still relatively young, it gives her more time to develop skills and relationships. However, I don't know much about her current situation or any past issues beyond the arrest mentioned.\n\nShe identifies as White, which might indicate some socioeconomic factors that could influence her risk, but without more info on systemic issues in her area, I can't be certain how significant this is.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. Re-arrest after a single conviction isn't uncommon, especially if she has a clean record now. But it does add a little weight to her risk.\n\nHer height and weight are 6'1\" and 163 lbs. These aren't red flags on their own unless they relate to substance use or health issues, which I don't have info on.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating but doesn't inherently increase risk without knowing her personal circumstances or any underlying issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is attending college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because it provides opportunities for better job prospects and skills.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year. Not having steady employment could contribute to stress, substance use, or other negative factors that might lead to re-arrest.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (only marijuana mentioned) can be a red flag. Even if she doesn't feel depressed now, past drug use can impair judgment and increase risk of illegal activities or substance abuse issues.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive, but I don't know her history. Sometimes short-term mood changes aren't indicative of long-term mental health.\n\nHer household size was four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes lead to more stress if individuals feel neglected, but again, without knowing current family dynamics or support systems, this is just one data point.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He affects her personal life positively. While belief in a higher power might influence behavior indirectly, it's not directly tied to reoffending unless she has specific issues like depression or anxiety that are influenced by her faith.\n\nPutting all this together: She has a single prior arrest, which is moderate risk. Her living situation alone isn't a strong risk factor but combined with her job status and past drug use adds some weight. Her education might mitigate some of the risks, but she's still young so not much time to build positive habits. The lack of depression in the past month could be a sign of stability or perhaps she's been managing things well.\n\nConsidering all factors, I'd lean towards high risk because of the arrest record and potential underlying issues like drug use without addressing mental health. But her education is a positive that might lower it slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"Having a single prior arrest increases the likelihood of reoffending, though it may be mitigated by personal growth and support systems.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can contribute to isolation but without additional risk factors, this is a minor concern.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) adds significant risk without addressing underlying mental health issues or other negative factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Attending college and having a high school diploma generally correlate with lower recidivism rates due to better job prospects and skills.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year may contribute to stress or substance use, which could affect re-arrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month is positive but without knowing her recent history, it's hard to assess potential underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 at a young age isn't inherently a strong risk factor without current family dynamics data.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing in God may influence behavior indirectly, but her positive feelings suggest she is managing her personal life well.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
