    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's significant; recidivists are more likely to reoffend. So that's probably high risk.\n\nHe's only 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I'm not sure how height affects risk assessment, but maybe in terms of physical capacity? Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nLiving alone might mean he doesn't have a support system, which could increase his chances of becoming involved with the criminal justice system again. That seems like medium to high risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational barriers can lead to unstable situations or substance use issues, both of which are bad signs for recidivism.\n\nOnly one job in a year suggests he might not have steady income or opportunities, potentially leading to more risky choices. That's medium-high.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive, but his recent feelings of low mood don't align with substance abuse. He might be struggling with mental health issues instead. That could lower risk slightly.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at young age; maybe he was part of a family that supported him differently? Not sure how that affects him now.\n\nBelieving God doesn't affect his personal life, which might mean he's more self-reliant but perhaps less mentally prepared for the challenges of adulthood. Maybe not directly linked to recidivism risk.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrest convictions (high), living alone (medium-high), lack of education and job stability (medium-high each), no drug use but mood issues suggesting possible mental health, which might be a low or medium factor depending on context. So overall, probably high risk.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions, indicating past involvement in the criminal system. Living alone may contribute to isolation and lack of support, potentially increasing recidivism risk. Educational barriers and unstable job situation could also pose risks.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Arrests and Convictions:** Four arrests with two convictions indicate a history of engaging with the criminal justice system, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\n2. **Living Alone:** Living alone at 18 suggests a lack of support structure, potentially leading to increased risk factors such as isolation or substance abuse.\n3. **Education and Job Status:** Lack of high school diploma and only one job in the past year could impact stability and decision-making, contributing to risky behaviors.\n4. **Mood Issues:** While there's no drug use, feelings of low mood might point toward mental health concerns that could influence behavior.\n\n**Prediction:**\nHigh risk due to multiple arrest convictions, living alone, educational barriers, and unstable job situation.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests with two prior convictions, indicating past involvement in the criminal justice system which is strongly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium-high\", \"Living alone at a young age may contribute to isolation and lack of support, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education and Job Stability\", \"medium-high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma and only one job in the past year could impact personal stability and decision-making, which are risk factors for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
