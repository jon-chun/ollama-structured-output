    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 21-year-old female and want each of her risk factors assessed with low, medium, or high weight. Then, using those weights, predict her rearrest recidivism over three years with a prediction (YES/NO) and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the factors given. Let's break them down one by one.\n\nShe's white, but race is generally not a direct risk factor unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting her, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe low.\n\nHer age is 21; she's quite young, so maybe lower risk compared to older adults who might have more life experience leading to more crimes. But that's just a thought; I need to check if there's any data supporting that. Maybe medium since it's possible she could make mistakes.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction. Prior convictions are definitely high risk because they indicate criminal history which can lead to higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and weight 163 lbs, but without knowing her BMI or other health factors like hypertension or obesity, it's hard to say. Maybe medium since it's a physical characteristic that doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are underlying health issues not mentioned here.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014being single can have both positive and negative aspects. Living alone might reduce the influence of others in her life who could offer support or guidance, so maybe low risk compared to someone with family support.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in a 2-year program. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism because higher education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability. So this might be a medium factor but leaning towards positive, perhaps low or medium.\n\nOnly held one job during the year\u2014this could be good as having gainful employment reduces ties to criminal activities. But if she's unemployed or underemployed, that's bad. She is enrolled in college which suggests proactive steps, so maybe medium risk because she has some education but not a stable job history.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be risky as it may lead to impulsive behaviors or other negative outcomes. However, recent feelings of depression might indicate she's trying to change her behavior, which is positive. So maybe medium risk since she's using but not having severe mental health issues.\n\nShe considers God involved in her life. Religious involvement often correlates with lower recidivism because it provides moral guidance and can lead to better decision-making. So this factor would be low or even very low.\n\nPutting all these together, prior conviction is a strong high risk. Age being young might temper that but not enough. Education is positive, living alone negative in terms of support network, drug use moderate, and religion helpful.\n\nThe prediction model should weigh these factors. High weight on prior conviction (high), lower on age (medium), medium on education, etc. So the overall likelihood is high but maybe not certain because of other mitigating factors like education and religion.\n\nConfidence would be around 75% since there's a clear risk signal from the prior conviction, but other factors mitigate it enough to reduce confidence below 80.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Her one prior arrest and one conviction indicate a history of criminal behavior which can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"She is quite young, but this age group is generally less likely to engage in criminal behavior compared to older individuals who may have more life experience leading to more crimes.
