He has a history of four arrests and two convictions, which immediately raises some red flags about his criminal history. Age is also a factor; being 18 means he's still developing socially and legally.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, which might indicate some instability or lack of support. His educational background shows he hasn't completed high school or a GED and isn't pursuing college, suggesting he may have struggled academically or chose this path out of necessity.\n\nOccupying only one job for a year points to limited work experience or maybe being underemployed. Not using drugs in the past four years is positive, but his recent feelings of low mood could be related to mental health issues, which might affect his stability and decision-making.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four suggests he's experienced family dynamics that could contribute to behavioral challenges. His lack of religious involvement might mean he doesn't have a support system or guidance in making important life choices.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014past criminal history, unstable living situation, educational gaps, limited job experience, recent mood issues, and family background\u2014I think the risk is pretty high for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and two convictions, indicating past behavior that may influence future stability and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"age_andDevelopment\", \"low\", \"Age at 18 suggests limited life experience and potential for further development, though this should be considered in context of other factors like criminal history and family background.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse may indicate social or family instability that could contribute to behavioral issues and increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, combined with not being enrolled in college, suggests limited opportunities and potential for further education which may aid in reducing future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"job_experience\", \"low\", \"Only one job held over the past year indicates limited career experience or potential for job instability, which could affect financial stability and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use in the past four years suggests a clean slate, but feelings of low mood may indicate underlying mental health issues that could impact behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of four may have contributed to behavioral challenges or instability, which could influence future criminal risk.\"),\n    (\"religion_involved\", \"low\", \"No involvement with God suggests no religious support system that could guide positive life choices and maintain stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
