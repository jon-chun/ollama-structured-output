    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she's already been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because recidivism tends to decrease with age as people gain more life experience, but having a prior conviction can increase risk.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I'm not sure how that plays into the risk assessment here. Maybe it's related to systemic issues or socioeconomic factors, but since she's completing college and is currently enrolled in another, her educational background might be a mitigating factor.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. I don't think height or weight are typically considered unless there's a history of substance abuse linked to weight, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nNot being married and living alone could mean she has fewer social supports, but if she's actively seeking help and is studying, that might not be as impactful.\n\nHer education level: associate degree and currently in college. Completing some college can correlate with better job opportunities and lower recidivism risk compared to those without a degree.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having a job can provide income stability and reduce the incentive to commit crimes for food or other needs, which might lower her risk.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is generally not as severe as harder drugs, so while it's a factor, the lack of recent depression symptoms might mitigate its impact.\n\nLiving with a household of four at a young age could mean more supervision or less exposure to risk factors like drugs or crime in the home environment.\n\nHer belief in God might suggest she has strong support systems or religious involvement, which can aid in personal accountability and seeking help, potentially reducing recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are a high risk factor. Her living situation at a young age is medium because it's not directly linked to recidivism but could have indirect effects through family support. Educational background is low since she has some formal education. No recent drug use with minimal depression suggests her drug use isn't a major issue, so maybe medium? Drug use itself is high due to past marijuana use.\n\nSo the risk factors would be Prior Convictions (High), Past Drug Use (High), and Living Situation (Medium). Combining these, the prediction might lean towards high risk because of the prior conviction and drug use despite some mitigating factors like education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a prior conviction which can increase rearrest risk as recidivism tends to be higher for those with a history of arrest and convictions.\"),\n    (\"Past Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"While marijuana use is generally less severe than harder drugs, it still poses a risk factor for substance abuse and potential substance-induced crimes or relapse.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of four at a young age which may provide some level of support but does not directly indicate high risk unless other factors like exposure to crime are considered.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
