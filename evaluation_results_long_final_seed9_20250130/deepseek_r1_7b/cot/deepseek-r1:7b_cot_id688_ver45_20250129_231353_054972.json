    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk of a 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. She has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might mean she's still relatively young and could be more susceptible but not necessarily a high risk yet. Her race is White; I don't see a direct link between race and recidivism in this case, so maybe that doesn't add much weight here.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. While her physical attributes can affect things like job availability or substance use, they aren't directly tied to criminal behavior unless she has health issues leading to drug use, which isn't mentioned.\n\nShe\u2019s single and living alone. Living alone is a known risk factor for recidivism because it reduces supervision and support systems that could help prevent further offenses.\n\nHer education level: associate or junior college completed and currently enrolled in another two-year program. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this might actually lower her risk, but since she's still studying, maybe the risk isn't as high yet.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job stability can contribute to lower recidivism because having a steady income and purpose can deter further criminal behavior. But with only one job, it might not be a strong indicator on its own.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a red flag, especially marijuana which is less harmful than other substances but still can lead to addiction or other issues that increase recidivism risk.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she might have good character traits, but this factor alone isn't enough to offset other negative indicators like her criminal history and drug use.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households often have more supervision, which can lead to better parenting or higher involvement from family, contributing to lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting it all together: She has one prior arrest, which is significant. Drug use adds some risk, but she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe that mitigates a bit. Living alone and having no kids might increase supervised time. Her education and single status with a job are positive factors.\n\nBut the presence of a criminal history, even if recent, can make her a high risk because recidivism rates tend to be higher in those with prior convictions. The other factors aren't strong enough to completely negate that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having one prior arrest and one conviction can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior, especially if it's recent.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Though she used marijuana in the past four years, not feeling depressed recently might suggest better mental health or lower substance use which could mitigate risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is a known risk factor for recidivism as it reduces supervision and support systems that can help prevent further offenses.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"While she has completed some education, ongoing enrollment in college might indicate proactive steps towards betterment which could lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year provides a sense of stability but may not be sufficient to predict long-term behavior changes that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of four as a young adult suggests some level of supervision which might contribute to better parenting or involvement in family dynamics\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
