    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether this 21-year-old female has a high risk of rearrest within three years. She's been convicted once, which is already a red flag. Her age might be a consideration too since younger individuals can sometimes have more volatile emotions.\n\nShe's White, but I'm not sure how that plays into recidivism rates beyond general statistics. Her living situation is alone, which might mean she's less likely to get support from family in case of issues. She has some education background, so maybe she's more motivated to change her behavior, but it's only up to a junior college level.\n\nShe's not married and hasn't felt depressed recently. That's interesting because sometimes lack of depression can be linked to substance use or other negative behaviors. Her past four years drug use (marijuana) is concerning. Even if she hasn't felt depressed, using drugs regularly can lead to other issues that might cause recidivism.\n\nShe was in a household of four when young, which could mean she wasn't living with her biological family anymore after some point. That might affect support systems or access to resources. Her belief in God is something to consider; while religion can be protective in some cases, it's not always directly linked to recidivism.\n\nShe held only one job last year, so maybe she was relying on that for stability and income when things went south. Being enrolled in college could indicate a desire to change her situation, but if she's struggling, that might not help much.\n\nPutting all these together: her prior conviction is the strongest indicator of high risk. Her drug use adds another layer because even without recent depression, substance abuse can lead to other problems. Her living alone and lack of family support could make her more vulnerable in times of need. The education background isn't strong enough to offset her risk factors.\n\nSo yeah, I think she's at a high risk based on these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"Her prior conviction indicates a history of criminal behavior which is a significant predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"She is 21 years old, making her relatively young and potentially more susceptible to change, but this factor alone does not strongly predict recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Her use of marijuana in the past four years suggests potential substance abuse issues which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce community support and access to resources, increasing vulnerability to stressors that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having completed only associate/junior college does not strongly indicate future behavior changes compared to higher education individuals.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"holding only one job during the year may suggest limited stability or economic dependence, which might contribute to financial stress but is a moderate factor in recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_size_young_age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 4 at a young age could indicate family dynamics that may have changed over time, potentially affecting support networks and access to help.\"),\n    (\"religion belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God might provide some protective factors, but it is not directly linked to recidivism risk in this context.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
