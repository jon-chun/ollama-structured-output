    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the rearrest recidivism risk for a 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her race is White. I remember from studies that being non-Hispanic White can have a lower recidivism rate compared to other groups, but it's not the only factor. She has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction, which definitely raises her risk. \n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant here; maybe if she was underweight or overweight in a certain context, but I think those factors aren't typically considered unless there's evidence of substance abuse.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Single status can be associated with higher recidivism rates because there might be less support network for after-prison issues. Living alone could mean isolation, which sometimes correlates with more risk-taking behavior.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education usually reduces recidivism, so that's a positive factor. She only holds one job during the year. Maybe she relies on this job heavily? Having fewer stable jobs can lead to financial instability, which might increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is generally less severe than harder drugs, so maybe it's a minor factor here unless there's evidence of drug-related issues.\n\nShe feels no depression in the past month, which could indicate good mental health, reducing risk factors. \n\nFrom a young age, she lived in a household of four. Larger households are often associated with more support and stability, which can lower recidivism risk due to having someone to turn to for help or advice.\n\nFinally, her belief in God might provide some moral guidance, which could positively influence her behavior post-prison.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest and conviction is a significant negative. No prior supervision suggests she was managed well before. Her job situation with only one job isn't necessarily bad but might contribute to instability. Education-wise, higher education partially mitigates the risk. The rest of the factors don't have strong positive indicators but also aren't overwhelming negatives.\n\nSo her overall risk is medium because while there are some mitigating factors like education and single living situation, the main negative factors (arrest, lack of supervision) weigh more heavily.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Having one arrest and conviction suggests a moderate risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"job stability\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the year may indicate some instability, but it doesn't significantly increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Higher education partially mitigates recidivism risk through better employability and financial stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than harder drugs; no recent depression further reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"single living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone may increase isolation, leading to higher risk of risky behavior or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"family support\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of four provides moderate support and stability which can reduce risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral guidance, positively influencing behavior post-prison.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
