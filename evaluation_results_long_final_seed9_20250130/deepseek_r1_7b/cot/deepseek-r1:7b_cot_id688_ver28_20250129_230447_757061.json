    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female, who is White, having rearrest within three years. She's been convicted once, has a priory offense, and several risk factors to consider.\n\nFirst, her past convictions: one prior arrest. That seems significant because reoffending after release can be influenced by prior criminal history. So that might point towards a medium weight since it's notable but not extreme.\n\nHer socioeconomic status is tied to her education level\u2014she has an associate degree and is currently in college. This could have implications, like access to support services or employment opportunities. However, being in college might also indicate she's proactive about her future, which could lower the risk a bit.\n\nMarriage status: she's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect her stability; living with family can provide support, but living alone without a partner might have different implications on lifestyle choices or social support.\n\nEducation level: She has some formal education but is still in higher education. College attendance could indicate commitment to personal development, which might be beneficial for reintegration into society positively.\n\nEmployment: Only one job during the year. Job stability and presence can influence self-sufficiency and financial independence, which are factors that might reduce recidivism risk. However, having only one job in a short period might suggest potential vulnerabilities.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a sensitive area because even low-level use can affect judgment and increase risk behaviors. But she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate she's managed her substance use better.\n\nAge at household size 4: She lived with others when younger. This could suggest she's been in environments where she had support or was exposed to positive influences that may have shaped her behavior.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious factors can sometimes influence behavior, but this might not directly contribute to risk unless there are known correlations between religion and recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the prior arrest is a strong factor (high weight). Socioeconomic aspects like education and employment are somewhat favorable but don't completely negate the risk. The factors related to living situation, drug use, and age aren't strong enough to tip the scale in either direction. Therefore, I would predict she might have a moderate chance of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending as recidivism is often influenced by past criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Higher education and ongoing studies may suggest a commitment to positive change, potentially reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a support network may affect stability but doesn't directly correlate with high risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"One job during the year might indicate some financial independence but could also signal vulnerability if relying solely on it for income.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No recent depression and limited marijuana use suggest better self-control, though past use can still influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living with a household of four may have provided support but doesn't directly correlate with high risk without further context.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
