    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she's already been convicted once. That might indicate some prior issues or perhaps a lack of stability. \n\nShe identifies as White, but I don't think race plays a direct role here unless there are systemic factors at play, which isn't indicated.\n\nHer height and weight: 6 feet 1 inch is tall, and she weighs 163 lbs. Weight can sometimes be an indicator of potential substance use or other factors, but without specific info on that, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and is currently in college. College attendance is generally associated with lower recidivism because of the commitment and possible career motivations.\n\nShe held only one job recently, which suggests she's not stable or perhaps isn't using her education effectively. Unemployment can lead to substance abuse or other risky activities.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a red flag for more serious issues like alcohol or opiate use, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHer belief in God might indicate strong moral values, which could reduce risk factors. However, personal beliefs don't always directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with four people. Sharing living conditions can lead to exposure to negative influences or substance use, especially if the environment wasn't ideal.\n\nConsidering all these factors: prior conviction (medium), unemployment (medium), drug use (high). The belief in God and being White might somewhat mitigate risk but aren't enough on their own.\n\nPutting it all together, she seems at moderate to high risk. I'd assign a relative weight of medium-high for the factors involved, leading to a higher confidence prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior conviction, which may indicate past issues that could influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests possible instability or lack of career focus, potentially leading to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years can be a significant risk factor for substance abuse and associated behaviors that may increase rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not directly indicate high risk but could be influenced by other factors like substance use or lack of support networks.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"While religious belief can provide moral guidance, it does not necessarily mitigate criminal behavior risks without additional context.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
