    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Being younger might mean she's more impressionable, but it also gives her time to learn and change. Maybe not a huge red flag yet.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure how race factors into risk assessment in this context, but generally, it can be a consideration if there are systemic issues or data biases. But since the question is about relative weight, maybe that's less significant than other factors here.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction. That's just one prior offense, so not too bad on the surface, but every offense counts towards recidivism risk.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and she weighs 163 lbs. No idea how BMI affects her or if it relates to risk factors, so maybe that doesn't factor in here.\n\nLiving alone isn't necessarily a risk factor unless there's social support issues, but since she's living alone on her own terms, maybe not as concerning.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education can correlate with lower recidivism because of better skills or support systems. So that might be a positive indicator, reducing the risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job stability can affect recidivism; having a job might mean she's more self-sufficient and less likely to revert to criminal behavior. But only one job isn't much, so maybe it's a neutral factor.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself is concerning because substance abuse can lead to other issues like employability or family problems, which might increase recidivism. However, if she feels okay now and is making efforts, perhaps that mitigates some risk. The recent lack of depression could mean she's trying harder.\n\nShe considers God to have a role in her life. That's a strong moral compass, but I'm not sure how it relates to recidivism. It might indicate good character traits or a stable environment, which is positive for lower risk.\n\nPutting this all together: one prior conviction and living alone aren't strong indicators of high risk. Education level is positive, job experience is neutral. Drug use with recent low depression could be a mitigating factor. Her moral compass doesn't directly influence recidivism but might indicate good personal behavior. \n\nSo overall, the factors seem to lean towards lower risk. Maybe I should assign each factor a weight and then predict accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals may be more impressionable but have time to change, so age is not a significant risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can be a consideration due to systemic issues or biases, this individual's White identification does not strongly indicate a high recidivism risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior offense indicates some risk but also shows maturity and potential for change.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is neutral without additional factors indicating instability or neglect.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Higher education correlates with lower recidivism due to better skills and support systems.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"neutral\", \"One job experience may suggest some stability but does not significantly impact risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Depression\", \"low\", \"While past drug use is concerning, recent low depression indicates efforts towards improvement.\"),\n    (\"Moral Compass\", \"high\", \"Strong moral values often correlate with positive personal behavior and reduced likelihood of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
