    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old female rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her race is White. I don't think race plays a significant role in recidivism rates compared to other factors like education or substance use. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's definitely a red flag. Repeating offenses can increase the chance of reoffending, so this should be high risk.\n\nHer age is 21, which might mean she's still developing her skills. But at the same time, she's fairly young, so maybe not as much risk as someone older who has more established habits. I'll lean towards medium here because her age could influence her decision-making and past behavior.\n\nHeight and weight are listed, but since she's 6'1\" and 163 lbs, which is a bit on the higher side. However, body type alone doesn't indicate much about her risk unless it's linked to substance use or other factors. So maybe low impact here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be isolating, but if she has no family support, that could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. But since she hasn't experienced any major stressors in the past month, it might not be a significant risk factor right now.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is currently in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism because of better job prospects and personal responsibility. So this should be low risk.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year. Unstable employment can lead to substance abuse, lack of support system, or other issues that might increase recidivism. However, if she recently completed her studies, maybe she's more stable now, so medium risk here.\n\nDrug use history: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is generally less harmful than harder drugs and doesn't necessarily lead to depression. So maybe this factor isn't as strong a risk indicator unless there are other signs of substance abuse, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's considered that God has some influence on her life. This might relate to her personal values or support system, but it doesn't directly tie into recidivism factors. Unless she feels disconnected from her community, which isn't indicated here, so maybe low risk impact.\n\nPutting it all together: High because of prior arrest and convictions. Medium for age and living situation. Low for education and no drug misuse beyond marijuana. So the overall prediction leans towards high risk but not extremely certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Racial background is White, which doesn't significantly impact recidivism rates compared to other factors like substance use or education.\"),\n    (\"Prior Offense\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old may still be developing decision-making skills, but it's not a strong predictor of future behavior without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't inherently increase risk unless there are underlying stressors or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in college and previously held an associate degree suggest good educational support and stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"One job during the year may indicate some instability, but recent completion of studies might mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is generally less harmful than other substances, though it doesn't directly correlate with depression unless indicated otherwise.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
