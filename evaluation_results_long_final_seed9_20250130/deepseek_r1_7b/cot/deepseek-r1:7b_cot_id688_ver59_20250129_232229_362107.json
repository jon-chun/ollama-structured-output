    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the risk assessment for this individual. She's a 21-year-old White female with one prior arrest and a conviction. Her age is quite young, just starting out in life, which might affect her recidivism rate.\n\nShe's living alone, which can be an indicator of higher risk because she has no support network to turn to if things go wrong. That's definitely a high factor.\n\nHer education level is associate or junior college and now pursuing a 2-year college. College attendance is generally linked to lower recidivism rates since it provides more skills and opportunities, so that might be a low factor.\n\nShe only held one job during the year, which could mean she's not stable financially or has ongoing issues finding steady employment, contributing to a medium risk.\n\nHer drug use history with marijuana in the past four years is concerning. Drug use can impair judgment and increase impulsive behavior, making her a high risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month might suggest some coping mechanisms, but it also indicates she's managing without help, which could be medium or low depending on other factors.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age, which suggests she didn't have a supportive environment early on. This could contribute to higher risk as seen environments play a role in behavior development.\n\nConsidering all these points\u2014age being too young, living alone, recent drug use, and lack of support from her past home\u2014the overall risk seems pretty high. I'll assign each factor accordingly and then weigh them collectively for the prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is quite young at 21 years old, which may indicate she is still developing life skills and experiences that could influence her recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"She is currently living alone, which can increase her vulnerability to stressors and social isolation that may lead to increased criminal behavior or substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which is a known precursor to more severe substance use disorders and can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium\", \"She has only held one job during the year, which may indicate instability or ongoing challenges in finding sustainable employment, potentially contributing to recidivism but not as significantly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement at a Young Age\", \"high\", \"She lived in a household of size 4 at a young age, which may have influenced her early exposure to social and environmental factors that could contribute to criminal behavior or substance use issues later in life.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
