    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this risk assessment for a 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number of past offenses, which probably indicates some underlying issues that led to multiple convictions. This seems like a strong indicator of recidivism.\n\nNext, his age is 18, which might mean he's still developing socially or emotionally, so maybe he could be more susceptible. But at the same time, he has only been convicted once before, which isn't too bad.\n\nHe identifies as Black, and sometimes race can influence the criminal justice system negatively, but I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism rates specifically for him unless there's a systemic issue, which I don't know about here. So maybe it's neutral or low weight.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 145 lbs. That's below average weight for his height. Underweight can sometimes be associated with poor health, which might affect his ability to manage substance abuse or other issues related to recidivism. So maybe this factor has a medium impact.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't necessarily increase risk, but it could mean he's not getting support, which might be a red flag for him trying to commit new crimes without help. However, it also depends on other factors like previous substance abuse or mental health issues. So maybe medium weight.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is a big factor in recidivism because people with less education may have fewer opportunities and might end up back in prison. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe held only one job during the year, which suggests he's underemployed or unemployed. Unemployment can lead to stress and potential substance abuse as a coping mechanism, which are known contributors to recidivism. This would be a high weight factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but had bad mood once. Past drug use, even if it stopped recently, could have negative consequences like mental health issues or otheraddictions that might contribute to relapse. The mood episode doesn't directly indicate substance abuse but could point towards mental health issues, which are related.\n\nHe lived in a household of four when young, which might mean he was exposed to a lot of people and different environments. This could have contributed to his current behavior, so maybe medium weight.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has no role in his life. If someone doesn't believe in a higher power or any force, they might have a harder time facing consequences for their actions, which could increase the chances of reoffending. So this is another high risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple past convictions (high), education issues (high), unemployment (high), and living in an environment that didn't support him (medium). The lack of belief in God might also be a contributing factor to his risk. Considering all these, I think the overall prediction would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Past Convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested four times and convicted indicates potential underlying issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED certificate places him at a disadvantage, increasing the likelihood of future incarceration.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment\", \"high\", \"Only holding one job suggests underemployment or unemployment, which can lead to stress and potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Mood Episode in Past Month\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing a mood episode could indicate mental health issues that may contribute to reoffending but isn't directly tied to substance use.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living with four household members as a young adult may have exposed him to various influences, some of which could impact his current behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
