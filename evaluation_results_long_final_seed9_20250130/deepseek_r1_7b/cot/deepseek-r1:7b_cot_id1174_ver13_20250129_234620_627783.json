    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he's been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant factor. Recidivism tends to run higher in people with a history of criminal behavior, so I'd assign this as high risk because past convictions are strong indicators of future criminal behavior.\n\nNext, his education level: he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Without proper education, he might face employment challenges and higher chances of engaging in risky behaviors like drug use or not seeking help when needed. So this is also a high risk factor.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which can contribute to isolation. Isolation often leads to increased stress and substance abuse, both of which are linked to higher recidivism rates. This would be another high factor.\n\nDrug use: he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but he did experience some low moods recently. While this is a positive sign, it's not clear if he's using substances now or has a history that could change. However, considering his recent feelings, there might be underlying issues prompting him to seek help, which could indicate lower risk, but I'm leaning towards medium because of the uncertainty around drug use.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes provide more support and stability, but it's also associated with higher rates of criminal behavior due to peer influences or lack of supervision. So this is probably medium risk.\n\nHis belief in God: he doesn't consider God to be involved in his personal matters. This could affect his decision-making regarding seeking help for substance abuse or other issues, potentially increasing risk. Therefore, it's a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together:\n- Past Convictions (High)\n- Education Level (High)\n- Living Alone (High)\n- Drug Use (Medium)\n- Young Household (Medium)\n- Belief in God (Medium)\n\nThe overall prediction leans towards high risk because of the strong factors from past convictions, education, and living situation. However, some medium factors might temper it a bit, but recidivism is still quite likely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of criminal behavior with four arrests and one conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED combined with not attending college, indicating potential challenges in obtaining stable employment or accessing necessary resources to avoid recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to increased stress and isolation which are known risk factors for substance abuse and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"No recent drug use but experiences of low mood could indicate potential substance use issues that need addressing, possibly mitigating but not eliminating risk.\"),\n    (\"young_household\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of four at a young age which is associated with higher rates of criminal behavior due to peer influences or lack of supervision.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Does not consider God involved in personal matters, potentially affecting decision-making regarding seeking help for substance abuse or other issues, increasing risk slightly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
