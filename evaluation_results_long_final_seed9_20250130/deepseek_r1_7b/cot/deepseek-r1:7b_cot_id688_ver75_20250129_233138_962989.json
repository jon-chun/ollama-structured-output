    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is quite young, so maybe she's still developing skills. But she has a criminal history with one prior arrest and a conviction. That's a significant factor\u2014prior convictions are strongly linked to higher recidivism.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I don't think race plays a direct role here unless there's systemic issues in the system affecting her, which isn't indicated. Her height is 6'1\" and weight 163 lbs, which doesn't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk.\n\nLiving alone might mean she has less support, possibly leading to higher stress or substance use issues. But I'm not sure if living situation alone makes it high; maybe medium?\n\nShe's never married and living alone could contribute to isolation. Isolation can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors, so that's a moderate risk factor.\n\nHer education is an associate or junior college degree and she's in college now. College completion usually reduces recidivism because of better opportunities and skills. So this might be low risk.\n\nEmployment: She held one job last year. Employment generally helps with stability and reducing recidivism, so that's probably a low factor.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana use but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to substance abuse issues which in turn affect re-arrest rates. Since she's using marijuana, that might increase the risk slightly\u2014maybe medium?\n\nHer past household size was 4 when young. Larger households can sometimes correlate with more support and better environments, but it could also mean less individualized attention or different living situations as she gets older.\n\nShe believes in God. While spirituality can aid recovery, it doesn't directly impact recidivism unless there's other supportive factors from her faith community, which isn't mentioned here\u2014so maybe low to no direct impact on risk.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior conviction is high, drug use medium, living situation moderate, education and job low, others low. So the overall prediction would be she has a higher chance of re-arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"She has one prior arrest and conviction which significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"She admitted to marijuana use but hasn't felt depressed recently, indicating potential substance abuse issues which can lead to re-arrest.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"moderate\", \"Living alone may contribute to isolation and increased stress or risky behaviors that could impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"She has a college education and is currently enrolled in another, which typically correlates with better job opportunities and reduced recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"She held one job last year; stable employment generally reduces recidivism risk through increased economic independence and life skills.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Her household size at a young age was 4, which may correlate with more support or different living conditions that could indirectly affect her current risk factors.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"She believes in God but no other supportive factors from her faith community are mentioned, so minimal direct impact on recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
