    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times with a conviction, which is a strong indicator of past trouble. His age being 18 might mean he's still developing, but it could also indicate he's not very experienced yet.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college, so educational challenges are likely impacting his life. Not working while living alone might lead to financial instability, which can affect his ability to avoid substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nLiving with four people at a young age suggests he's been part of a larger household, which sometimes includes more pressure points like family issues or unstable environments. That could contribute to his criminal history and future behavior.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, so he might not have the same level of spiritual support to cope with stressors or make positive choices. This lack of belief can lead to coping mechanisms that might not be as effective against substance abuse or other negative influences.\n\nNot using drugs for four years is a good sign, but his recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying issues like depression or anxiety. If these aren't addressed, they could escalate into substance use or more serious behaviors if he doesn't have solid support systems.\n\nPutting all this together, the factors point towards a high risk of rearrest because of his criminal history, education challenges, living situation, lack of belief in God, and potential mental health issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested four times with a conviction, indicating a history of problematic behavior that could lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which may limit opportunities for positive development and reduce stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"He has held only one job during the year and is currently living alone, which could result in financial instability and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors such as drug use.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"He lived with a household of size 4 at a young age, which may have exposed him to family dynamics or environmental factors that contribute to criminal behavior or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"He does not believe in God and has felt down during the past month; this lack of spirituality could impact his ability to seek support or make positive choices when faced with challenges.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"He reported feeling down recently, which may indicate underlying mental health issues that could exacerbate substance use or other negative behaviors if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
