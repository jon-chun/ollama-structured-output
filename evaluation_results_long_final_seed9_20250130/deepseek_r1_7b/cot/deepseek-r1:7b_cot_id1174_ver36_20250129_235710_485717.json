    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times with convictions, which is a red flag. Age-wise, being 18 might mean he's still developing, but having multiple arrests could indicate past issues.\n\nHis height and weight are given as 5'10\" and 145 lbs. That doesn't immediately raise a risk factor unless it's related to substance abuse, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so no partner to share responsibilities or support with. No high school diploma or GED means he might have struggled academically, possibly leading him into trouble. He's only held one job in the past year, suggesting underemployment or lack of stability.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive, but the mention that sometimes he feels very low could hint at underlying mental health issues affecting his behavior. His early life with a household size of 4 might have influenced his sense of security or led to higher risk-taking as an adult.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which can affect motivation and decision-making, possibly leading him towards riskier choices. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable living situation, limited job experience, potential mental health issues, and early-life experiences. These factors collectively point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending.

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
