    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this risk assessment for a young man. I'm not an expert, but I'll do my best based on the information given.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which makes him quite young. Young adults are often seen as more prone to making impulsive decisions because their brains are still developing. That's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I'm not sure how race factors into risk assessments, but sometimes there might be underlying issues that aren't directly stated here. Maybe systemic factors or societal influences could play a role, so I'll consider that as medium.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times and convicted. That's significant. Recidivism rates for repeat offenders are higher than for first-time offenders. So this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 145 lbs. While weight can sometimes be an indicator of substance abuse, in this case, there's no mention of drug use besides the last four years. He hasn't used drugs recently but felt down during the past month. That might relate to mental health issues rather than drug use.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can increase stress levels and social isolation, which are known contributors to recidivism. So that's another high risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education gaps can lead to unstable situations, lack of skills for employment, and possibly involvement with the criminal system again. That's definitely high.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having a job is positive because it can provide stability and reduce stress. However, if he's been through four arrests, maybe his job isn't stable or secure anymore, which could indicate other issues like lack of support or substance abuse.\n\nFeeling down for extended periods without any drug use might suggest underlying mental health issues. While not directly a crime, mental health can affect his ability to reintegrate into society and commit crimes again. So that's medium but contributes indirectly to risk.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households often have more support and resources, which could be positive, but since he's now living alone, maybe the dynamics changed, possibly leading to isolation or dependency on others for help, increasing risk.\n\nBelieving that God has no role in his life might affect his motivation towards positive behavior, possibly making him more likely to engage in risky or criminal activities. That's a medium factor but could influence other aspects of his behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple high factors like past convictions, age, living alone, lack of education, and one job. These are strong indicators of higher risk. The mention of feeling down might hint at underlying issues that could worsen the situation. I'm leaning towards a high confidence prediction of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young adults (18 years old) are often seen as more prone to making impulsive decisions due to developing brains.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race is not directly indicated, Black individuals may face systemic issues that could influence risk assessments.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase stress and social isolation, contributing to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED indicates potential for employment instability and skill gaps.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Held one job during the year, but this may not reflect current stability or health issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for extended periods might suggest underlying mental health issues affecting behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of four at a young age, which could change dynamics when living alone now.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has no role in his life, potentially influencing motivation towards positive behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
