    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 21-year-old female who was arrested once. She's White, lives alone, has a job, but used marijuana in the past four years. Let me break down each factor.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is on the younger side. Young adults might be more likely to engage in behaviors that could lead to recidivism, even if they've been clean for a while. But she's only one offense and is completing college, so education level is positive.\n\nShe uses marijuana occasionally, but hasn't felt depressed recently. That's interesting because substance use can sometimes have negative consequences, but not always directly linked to recidivism. It might be a red flag if it led to more issues, but here she seems okay.\n\nLiving alone increases risk because there's no one to support her in case of problems or emergencies. Maybe she needs help, which makes me think about support systems as another factor.\n\nShe has a job, so she's employed and probably supports herself financially. That might reduce the need for substance use as a crutch, but she still uses marijuana sometimes.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards medium risk. The single living situation is a big positive, but occasional drug use isn't a strong negative yet. She seems to have some support from her job and being in college.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 21 may indicate she is still exploring life and may be more likely to engage in behaviors that could lead to recidivism despite her clean use of marijuana recently.\"),\n    (\"Marijuana Use\", \"low\", \"She has used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed, suggesting it's a minor use without significant negative effects.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases the risk of substance abuse and instability, which could contribute to recidivism despite her clean recent behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She is employed full-time, which can reduce the need for substance use as a crutch and may provide stability and support.\");\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
