    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether a 21-year-old female has a high risk of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her race is White, which might influence the system in some way, but generally, race isn't a direct indicator of recriminivism unless there's systemic bias involved. Since no other factors related to race are present, I'll consider it as low risk here.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction, so that's a moderate risk factor. One offense can sometimes lead to more supervision or higher chances of reoffending if not properly addressed.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. Weight doesn't directly predict recidivism, but her BMI isn't particularly high, so maybe no direct impact here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can affect support systems, but since she's an only child or similar situation, it might not contribute much to risk unless there are other factors like substance use.\n\nShe has a associate degree and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because of better job prospects, so this should be low risk.\n\nHaving held one job during the year isn't great but also doesn't indicate high risk on its own. Maybe she's looking for more stable employment.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is concerning. Substance abuse can increase recidivism rates because of potential relapse or increased criminal behavior related to drug use.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in a month, which might be a positive sign as depression can sometimes lead to self-harm or substance abuse issues that contribute to crime.\n\nFrom a young age, she lived with four people. Maybe she had some exposure or family issues, but without knowing if there were disciplinary actions from those living arrangements, it's hard to gauge. However, higher household size doesn't inherently correlate with higher risk unless there were problems within the household.\n\nBelieving in God might indicate a strong moral framework, which could be protective rather than harmful, so that factor would lean towards low risk.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest, drug use (high), living alone (low), education and job (low), family history (low). So overall, the risk is high due to the drug use. The prediction should be YES with a confidence of around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Her race is White, which may not directly indicate recriminivism unless there's systemic bias involved.
