    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of a 21-year-old female rearrest within three years. She has some specific factors that need to be considered here. Let me break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she's already been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because being in custody early can sometimes lead to more serious behavior or substance abuse issues later on.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I don't think race plays a direct role here unless there are systemic factors we're considering, which isn't specified, so maybe that doesn't impact the risk assessment much. She's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs; however, weight alone isn't enough to determine her risk without context on how she maintains her weight or any health issues.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which might make her more prone to substance abuse as a coping mechanism. But since she's not depressed over the past month, maybe that factor isn't as strong here.\n\nHer educational background: associate or junior college completed and currently in a 2-year program. Some education is generally protective, but if she's not getting support in her current job or life situation, it might not be enough to offset other negative factors.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Having a job can provide stability, so that's positive. However, joblessness can sometimes lead to higher stress levels and substance abuse issues, which could affect her re-arrest rate.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana is generally less habit-forming than other drugs like cocaine or heroin, but it can still contribute to behavioral issues if she's using other substances as well. Her recent lack of depression might suggest she's managing her substance use without severe issues.\n\nPast household size was 4 when she was young. A larger household could mean more supervision and fewer opportunities for risky behavior, so that's a protective factor here.\n\nBelieving in God: this is a strong indicator of good character because people who believe in higher power tend to engage in prosocial behaviors rather than engaging in criminal activity or substance abuse.\n\nPutting all these together, the only significant risk factors are the past arrest and the fact that she used marijuana. The rest seem mitigating factors with no major negative indicators except maybe the lack of support from being single. However, considering the low number of mitigators, her risk might still be on the higher side but not extremely high.\n\nI think her overall risk is moderate because while there are some negative points like past arrest and drug use, the positive factors like education, stable living situation, and good belief in God counterbalance them enough to keep the risk relatively low. But I'm not entirely confident without more data on her current support system or any other potential issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrest\", \"low\", \"Her being arrested once and convicted at a young age indicates a history of criminal behavior which can be a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which is generally less habit-forming than other substances but still contributes to potential behavioral issues.
