    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male and predict his rearrest recidivism over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four prior convictions. That's definitely a high risk because past convictions increase the chance of reoffending.\n\nHe's Black, which can be a marker for systemic issues affecting his access to resources or support, so that might add some weight as well.\n\nAt 5'10\" and 145 lbs, I wonder if there's any indication of being overweight. No mention here, but body type could relate to health risks, though it's not provided.\n\nLiving alone can lead to isolation, which is a risk factor for reentry into the criminal system.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests he might have less access to education opportunities or support services.\n\nOnly one job in a year isn't great; unemployment or underemployment often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's not using drugs and had a bad emotional month, but since he's clean now, that might indicate better mental health. However, his prior state could have issues.\n\nYoung age at which he lived in a household of four might mean he was raised in an environment without stability or support.\n\nReligion doesn't seem to play a role here; maybe it affects social support differently elsewhere.\n\nHis belief in God personally might relate to self-efficacy and personal responsibility, but since he feels down sometimes, that could be a risk factor for emotional instability affecting his behavior.\n\nPutting all these together, the high factors are clear\u2014criminal history, age at home, lack of education. Medium factors include living alone and job issues. The low factors don't stand out much here except maybe the clean drug use now.\n\nUsing the assigned weights: four prior convictions (high), Blackness (high), no college (medium), living alone (medium), unemployment (medium), religion (low). So, high risk for each of those.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has multiple high-risk factors due to his criminal history and personal circumstances. These include prior convictions, living alone, lack of education, and potential emotional instability despite being drug-free.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"He has four prior convictions which significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"His Blackness may be linked to systemic issues affecting access to resources and support, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a job or being underemployed can lead to increased stress and potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities for betterment and could contribute to unstable situations.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"He has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
