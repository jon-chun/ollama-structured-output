    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. She has only one prior arrest, so that's a low risk factor compared to someone with multiple offenses. Her age is also on the younger side, which might be favorable.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I don't see any systemic factors mentioned here. Marital status isn't relevant since she's living alone anyway. Height and weight aren't significant in recidivism assessment unless there's an issue with substance use, which we'll get to.\n\nShe has a high school education and is attending college, so her educational attainment is good. Only one job during the year; maybe it's part-time or she's self-sufficient. She used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate she's managing her substances well.\n\nFamily history: living with three others at a young age could suggest some instability, possibly leading to higher risk factors like substance abuse or lack of support. Her spirituality seems positive; she believes in God and sees that as a strength rather than a weakness.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors:\n\nPrior Arrests (1): Low\nAge (21): Low\nEducation (completed associate): Medium\nEmployment (1 job): High (since one job might indicate less stability)\nDrug Use (marijuana): High (substance use can lead to other issues and higher recidivism)\nMarital Status: No effect here, so low\nFamily Size: 4 at a young age: Low but could be medium if it's leading to stress or dependency\nSpirituality: Positive, so maybe no negative impact\n\nPutting this together, her drug use is a significant risk factor. She only has one prior arrest and education beyond high school, which might help in managing substance abuse.\n\nSo overall prediction? Probably low to medium risk, but considering she used marijuana, perhaps it tips towards higher risk factors for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"Her single prior arrest suggests a lower risk of reoffending compared to individuals with multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"At 21 years old, she is relatively young, which can be an indicator of less life experience and potentially lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Attainment\", \"medium\", \"Having completed associate education and currently attending college may indicate some stability but could also suggest room for improvement in managing substance use or career progression which might contribute to recidivism if not actively addressed.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Only holding one job during the year might suggest a sense of financial independence, however, it could also imply limited support network and potential isolation which can be risky factors in the long term.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana is a known risk factor for substance abuse, which can lead to legal issues, health problems, and increased likelihood of criminal behavior.
