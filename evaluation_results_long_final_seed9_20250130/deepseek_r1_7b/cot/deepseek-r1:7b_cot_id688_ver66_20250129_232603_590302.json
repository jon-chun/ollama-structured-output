    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. I need to evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might indicate she's still developing life skills. Being White isn't directly tied to recidivism unless there are systemic issues, but that's not provided here, so maybe it's low weight.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. That's significant because prior convictions increase the risk of reoffending. So high relative weight for prior convictions.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and she weighs 163 lbs. Weight isn't typically a risk factor unless it leads to substance use, but she admitted to drug use in the past four years (marijuana). That's a medium weight factor because drug use can influence behavior.\n\nShe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living with family might provide support, but living alone increases stressors. Medium weight here as it's a social risk factor.\n\nEducation level: associate degree completed but still enrolled in college. Higher education generally reduces recidivism, so low weight.\n\nEmployment: only one job during the year. Unemployment can lead to dependency issues, maybe medium weight.\n\nDrug use: she has used marijuana, which is a potential substance abuse issue. Medium weight since it's recent and affects behavior.\n\nPast household size of 4 might indicate family support but could also be stressors if things were strained. Medium weight.\n\nBelief in God: spirituality can sometimes provide coping mechanisms or focus on moral values. Low to no direct impact on recidivism unless it affects decision-making, so maybe low weight.\n\nPutting all together, her prior conviction is the highest risk factor. Other factors like drug use and living alone are also significant but not as impactful as her past arrest. Considering all, I would rate her low to medium risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age may indicate developing life skills but does not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"past_drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, can influence behavior and decision-making which may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"single24_hours\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases stressors such as isolation and financial instability that could lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Higher education levels are generally associated with lower recidivism rates, so this factor has a low relative weight.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment status is not a strong indicator of recidivism risk compared to other factors like drug use or prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"household_size_24h\", \"medium\", \"A household size of 4 could indicate family support but may also signal underlying stressors that could impact behavior.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide coping mechanisms but does not directly correlate with recidivism risk unless it affects decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
