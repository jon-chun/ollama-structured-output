    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male who has been arrested four times. He's Black, which might be a factor in recidivism studies, though I remember that race doesn't directly cause crime but can influence systemic issues affecting him.\n\nHe's got a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's pretty significant. Recidivists often have multiple past offenses, so that's definitely high risk.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and he weighs 145 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like weight or height typically predict recidivism on their own without additional context, but maybe his past behavior could relate to that.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence his ability to reintegrate after incarceration, affecting future recidivism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a big factor; not completing school often correlates with higher recidivism rates because of limited opportunities for reintegration.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Employment stability can help reduce recidivism, so having no job might increase risk.\n\nHis drug use history is clean for four years but mentions feeling down recently. While he hasn't used drugs, his mood could be related to other stressors or underlying issues that might affect him after release.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes provide more support and stability, though it depends on the dynamics.\n\nHis belief in God might suggest religious coping mechanisms which could help manage stress but also could indicate neglect if he's not actively seeking spiritual guidance.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests, educational issues, living alone, no job\u2014all point towards high risk of rearrest. The factors are significant enough that I should assign a high relative weight to each.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests\", \"high\", \"Four previous arrests indicate a history of criminal behavior which is a significant predictor of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level_inadequacy\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED suggests limited educational opportunities and skills, potentially hindering reintegration efforts.\"),\n    (\"unstable_living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce support networks, increasing the risk of relapse after incarceration.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_job\", \"medium\", \"Not having a job during the year may reflect instability or difficulty in finding gainful employment post-release.\"),\n    (\"past_negative_mood\", \"low\", \"While he hasn't used drugs recently, feeling down could indicate underlying stressors that might affect him after release.\"),\n    (\"small household_history\", \"low\", \"Living with four people at a young age doesn't directly correlate to higher risk but may have been temporary or unrelated to current living conditions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
