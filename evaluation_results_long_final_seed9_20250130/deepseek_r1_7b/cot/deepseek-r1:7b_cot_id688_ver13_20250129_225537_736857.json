    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let's break down all her factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's high risk right there.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs, but weight doesn't directly indicate her behavior here unless maybe she's been in some challenging situations, but with no other info on that front, I'll consider it neutral.\n\nMarried? No. She's living alone, which might suggest she's responsible, but also could mean she's dealing with personal issues that haven't come to light yet.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is in a 2-year program. Education can help reduce recidivism if she's completing it because it signals stability, so maybe medium risk here since she's progressing through school.\n\nOnly one job in the past year suggests she might be underemployed or facing some challenges in her current job, which could contribute to stressors that lead to substance use or other issues. So that's another high factor.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana is a mild drug and doesn't have severe penalties like crack cocaine. Her recent lack of depression might indicate she's managing her situation, so maybe this isn't as concerning as other drug issues, making it low risk.\n\nYoung age at which she lived with four people: Starting at 16 or younger could mean she had to mature quickly, possibly leading to family issues or instability, contributing to higher risk. So that's high.\n\nBelieving in God might indicate strong moral support system, but if there are personal struggles not addressed by her faith, it's hard to say. Maybe moderate? But since she doesn't mention any other issues, I'll consider it neutral here.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest is a big factor (high), living with four people at a young age adds to the risk (high). Drug use, despite being marijuana, might not be a significant issue unless there's underlying mental health, which isn't indicated. Her job situation and education suggest some stability but don't completely offset the other factors.\n\nSo her overall risk is high because two major factors are contributing significantly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and increased likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Young Age\", \"high\", \"Living with four people at such a young age can indicate potential family issues or instability that may contribute to substance use or other behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, but there is no mention of significant mental health issues related to drug use, which might mitigate this risk factor compared to more severe drugs like crack cocaine.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"medium\", \"While she is completing her education, only holding one job in the past year could suggest underlying personal challenges that may affect stability and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Structure\", \"neutral\", \"Living alone and being married at a young age without specific issues mentioned suggests moderate family dynamics but no direct link to increased risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
