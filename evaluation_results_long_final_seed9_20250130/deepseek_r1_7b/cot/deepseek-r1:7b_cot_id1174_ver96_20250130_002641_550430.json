    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. He has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's definitely concerning because more convictions usually mean higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHe's only 5'10\" and 145 lbs, but I don't think his height or weight directly affect his risk. He's living alone, which might make him feel more isolated and possibly increase his risk of substance abuse or other issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014this is a significant factor because people without education sometimes have fewer job opportunities and might turn to drugs or other substances as a way to cope. Plus, he hasn't been enrolled in college, so maybe he's not seeking help or changing his situation.\n\nHe only held one job during the year, which isn't great. Maybe he struggled to find steady employment or isn't utilizing his skills effectively. That could lead him to seek alternatives like drugs when he's feeling down.\n\nHe didn't use drugs in the past four years, but sometimes feeling low can still influence choices. It might not be substance abuse per se, but it could affect his motivation or willingness to change his situation.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age. A larger family might provide more support, but if he's now living alone, maybe he's gone through some significant changes that could impact him negatively.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might lead him to different values or cope differently with challenges, which could either positively or negatively influence his behavior. It doesn't directly point to substance abuse but could affect personal motivation towards change.\n\nPutting this all together: His criminal history is a big red flag, education issues, unemployment history, and isolation. All these factors suggest he's at high risk of reoffending within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"High due to four arrests and two convictions, indicating past problematic behavior.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Low with no diploma or GED, potentially limiting future opportunities and increasing substance use risk.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Employed one job but not utilized skills, which may lead to seeking alternative solutions like substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase feelings of isolation and potential substance use, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use, but feelings of low may still influence choices without direct substance involvement.\"),\n    (\"family size at young age\", \"medium\", \"Family of four may provide support that has now changed, potentially impacting his behavior and motivation.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in God does not directly relate to substance use but could affect personal values and motivation towards change.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
