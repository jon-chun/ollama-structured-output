    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of a 18-year-old Black male with multiple arrest convictions. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has four prior arrests and a conviction. That's a high recidivism risk because reoffending is common after previous convictions.\n\nHis height (5'10\") and weight (145 lbs) don't directly indicate risk but might be relevant for other factors like behavior in law enforcement settings.\n\nHe's living alone, which could increase vulnerability to stressors or exploitation. But he has no ties outside his current home, so maybe that factor isn't as high here.\n\nNo high school diploma and not enrolled in college suggests he may have low educational support, possibly leading to unstable employment or substance use.\n\nHe held one job recently; working alone might leave him reliant on employer for stability, which is a risk factor because losing that job could lead to unemployment and further issues.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but had a bad mood last month. This could be stress-related rather than drug use, so maybe low to medium risk from this perspective.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with four people; now living alone might mean less supervision or support, increasing risk of self-harm or substance abuse.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life could affect his motivation. If he's not religiously supported, seeking help for mental health issues may be harder, which is a red flag.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior convictions (high), living alone and lack of support (medium), low education (low), recent job (medium). The other factors seem to mitigate some risk but overall still high. So the prediction is \"YES\" with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Having four prior arrests and a conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending, which is a known predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase stress or isolation, potentially leading to substance abuse or self-harm, though this factor alone does not guarantee high risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED and not currently enrolled in college reduces educational support and opportunities, which can contribute to unstable lives and higher recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"recent_job\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the past year may leave him vulnerable if employment is lost or reduced, potentially leading to further issues with food, housing, or substance use.\"),\n    (\"religion Belief\", \"low\", \"Not having a strong religious support could affect his motivation and ability to seek help for mental health issues, which is an important factor in reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
