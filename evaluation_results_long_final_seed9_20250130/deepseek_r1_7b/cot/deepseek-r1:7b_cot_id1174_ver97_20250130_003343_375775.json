    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearrest based on his history. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That seems pretty significant. Recidivism often increases with more prior convictions because each time someone gets caught, it can affect their credibility and job prospects. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 145 lbs. I don't know if his weight or height directly relates to recidivism, but maybe not relevant here.\n\nLiving alone without a spouse is okay; I don't see how that increases risk unless there's someone else to support him, which isn't the case here.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. His educational level can impact his opportunities and stability, so unemployment or lack of skills might lead to more substance use or unstable situations.\n\nHe held one job recently but didn't use drugs for four years. However, he felt down sometimes, which could indicate mental health issues that might contribute to substance abuse later.\n\nSince he's 18, his decision-making abilities are probably still developing, making him more susceptible to negative influences or poor choices as an adult.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at some point and has a belief in God unrelated to his personal outcomes. Maybe this doesn't directly affect risk but could influence his mental health.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple factors like prior convictions, lack of education, unstable living situation, and potential mental issues are all pointing towards higher recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, which significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, combined with not being enrolled in college, may indicate limited opportunities that could contribute to unstable situations or substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Only held one job recently and has not used drugs for four years, suggesting some stability but also a potential lack of skills that might lead to future challenges.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health and Emotions\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for extended periods may indicate underlying mental health issues that could worsen substance abuse or other risky behaviors in the future.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone without a spouse, which is generally stable but might not provide support for potential triggers of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
