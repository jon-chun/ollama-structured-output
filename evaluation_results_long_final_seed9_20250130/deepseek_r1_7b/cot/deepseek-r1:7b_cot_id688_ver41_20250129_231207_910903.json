    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a query from someone who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They've provided detailed information about a 21-year-old female and want me to assign relative weights to her risk factors before predicting her rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each factor they've given. She's White, single, living alone, with a bachelor's degree, one job, drug use (marijuana), not depressed in the past month, and has a small household history.\n\nI'll start by categorizing each factor into low, medium, or high risk based on their impact. Being White could have some racial disparities, so that might be medium risk. Her education is at an associate level but now pursuing college, which is positive; maybe low risk because higher education often correlates with better outcomes.\n\nShe's never married and living alone\u2014both factors can contribute to substance use and isolation, so perhaps medium risk. Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) could indicate a potential for continued use, making it high risk. Not feeling depressed might suggest she's managing her mental health well, but that's mixed; maybe low.\n\nHousehold size of 4 at young age\u2014smaller families can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism if there's less supervision, so medium risk. Her belief in God might reduce stress, making it low risk as spirituality often helps.\n\nPutting this together, the high-risk factors are significant, but not all. I'll predict a \"YES\" with 45% confidence because while she has some negative risk points, like drug use and living alone, she also has positive aspects that could mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 21 may indicate emerging adulthood, which can be associated with higher recidivism rates as individuals navigate life changes.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has completed a junior college degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college, which are positive factors correlated with better outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to potential isolation or substance use issues, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor associated with substance abuse and potential criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Depression History\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, which may indicate good mental health and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 4 at a young age could potentially contribute to family dynamics or substance use issues that may correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Her belief in God may provide a sense of stability and reduce stress, which is associated with lower recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
