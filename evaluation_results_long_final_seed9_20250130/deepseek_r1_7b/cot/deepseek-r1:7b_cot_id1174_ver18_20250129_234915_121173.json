    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male for rearrest recidivism over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's a significant criminal record, which is definitely high risk because past behavior often predicts future behavior.\n\nHis age is 18, which might be a consideration since younger individuals can sometimes have more volatile emotions or less life experience, but his other factors are more impactful here.\n\nHe identifies as Black, which may correlate with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues and lack of representation in the justice system. That's another high factor.\n\nHeight is 5 feet 10 inches and weight 145 lbs\u2014nothing jumps out about this physically that would indicate high risk, so probably low or medium.\n\nLiving alone might be a red flag because living with family can provide support and reduce stressors. However, without more context on his environment, it's safer to consider it as low unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014this is concerning because education often correlates with lower recidivism rates when employed or having stable income. This factor alone pushes towards high risk.\n\nNot enrolled in college and only one job\u2014unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse, lack of skills for new opportunities, which are both high-risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but had a bad emotional month where he felt so down. That's concerning because while he's not currently using drugs, persistentemo yl issues could lead to relapse or increased risk of engaging in harmful behaviors that contribute to recidivism.\n\nYoung age and living with a household of four at a young age might indicate family instability, which can be a high risk factor as it may affect his ability to form stable relationships and support system.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could suggest a lack of religious or moral support, which is often found in higher-risk populations. This is another high factor.\n\nPutting all these together\u2014multiple high factors like criminal history, lack of education, unemployment, family issues, and emotional distress\u2014all point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and two convictions.
