    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to rearrest within three years. Let's start by looking at all the information given.\n\nShe's a 21-year-old White female with one prior arrest and a conviction. That's not great, but she's just 21, which might mean she has time to turn things around. Her height and weight don't seem relevant here; it's more about her personal circumstances.\n\nShe's living alone, which can sometimes be a risk factor because she doesn't have support. She hasn't been married yet, so no dependents to help her out. Education-wise, she has an associate degree and is still in college. College education is usually a positive sign because it shows commitment and might indicate someone looking to improve their situation.\n\nShe's only held one job during the year. Having stable employment can reduce recidivism, but having just one job doesn't necessarily make her at risk unless there are other issues like substance use or instability.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years.Marijuana use isn't as severe as hard drugs, and some studies suggest it might not have a strong association with rearrest compared to harder drugs. But she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe she's managing her use well.\n\nHousehold size at young age was 4, which is a bit larger than average but doesn't directly correlate to higher risk unless there were issues within the household. She believes in God, which can be a positive motivator for personal behavior change.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a clean record, she's educated and still studying, living alone might be a minor concern but not a big one if she's stable. Her job situation is okay with just one job. Drug use isn't severe, though it's something to monitor. No family issues mentioned, so that's positive.\n\nI don't see any major red flags here that would push her into high risk. She seems proactive and has good educational support. So maybe she's at low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has only one prior arrest, which may indicate a possible path towards positive change.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be a minor risk factor but depends on other factors like stability and support.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She is currently enrolled in college and has a associate degree, suggesting ongoing commitment to betterment.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Having one job may not be sufficient for stability, but it does indicate some level of responsibility and previous work experience.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is generally less severe than hard drugs, though monitoring is important.
