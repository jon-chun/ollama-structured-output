    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic factors, but since she's only 21 and likely in the early stages of her career, maybe these disparities haven't manifested yet. So this might be a low or medium weight factor depending on other variables.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That's a significant risk because having a criminal history increases the chance of reoffending. Also, she's currently employed part-time at a college, which could help with stability but doesn't negate her past issues. So this is probably a high weight factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism. Maybe if there was some association with health issues, but here it's just physical attributes.\n\nShe's living alone, single, no children, so she might not have the support system that could help prevent recidivism. Living arrangements can affect mental health and stability, so this is a medium weight factor.\n\nHer educational background: associate degree and currently in college. College attendance is generally associated with better job prospects and higher earnings, which can reduce recidivism risk because of better economic stability. So maybe low or medium?\n\nShe's worked one job during the year. Employment can help, but only one job might not provide enough income to sustain herself if she faces difficulties. This could be a medium weight.\n\nDrug use: she has used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a risk factor because it can impair judgment, lead to substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates. But since she's not feeling depressed now, maybe the impact isn't as high? Still, drug use should be considered medium.\n\nShe considers God has some influence on her life. Religious factors can vary widely and aren't always directly linked to recidivism unless there's a belief in forgiveness or strict moral codes that prevent problematic behavior. However, if she's been influenced by such beliefs, it might actually reduce risk. So this is probably low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high), current instability (medium), drug use (medium). The rest are low or medium but not significant enough to outweigh the high and mediums. \n\nSo overall, her risk of rearrest seems high because of prior convictions and living situation. Her job might help a bit, but the other factors are pulling it up.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"She has one prior arrest and one conviction which significantly increases the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"current_instability\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no children or support network may contribute to instability and increased risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment at a college level can provide economic stability, mitigating risk but not completely eliminating it.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years is associated with higher recidivism rates despite recent lack of depression symptoms.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious influence may offer forgiveness or moral guidance reducing risk compared to other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
