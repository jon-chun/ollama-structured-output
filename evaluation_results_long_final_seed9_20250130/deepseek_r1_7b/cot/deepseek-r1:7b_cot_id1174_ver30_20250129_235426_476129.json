Let's break down all his factors step by step.\n\nFirst off, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's pretty significant. I remember that multiple prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism because they show he's had trouble before, which might mean he doesn't respond well to treatment or supervision.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 145 lbs. Weight is a factor in recidivism studies sometimes, but it depends on other factors like his health or lifestyle. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that's positive, which might lower the risk compared to someone with drug issues.\n\nHe's living alone and not married. Living alone can be isolating and may contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors. Not being married could also mean he's more vulnerable to certain stresses or influences from others.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is linked to lower recidivism rates because it provides opportunities and skills that can help him reintegrate into society positively.\n\nHe only held one job during the year, which might indicate limited economic stability or support. If he's unemployed or underemployed, that could increase stress and lead to other issues contributing to his recidivism risk.\n\nHis recent feelings of depression are concerning because persistent mental health issues can impede his ability to reintegrate into society without support. He doesn't believe in God, which might affect his decision-making processes around things like seeking help or community support.\n\nHe was raised in a household of four, so living with more people could mean exposure to different influences that might not be positive. The fact that he feels nothing about God suggests he may turn to other sources for meaning, which can lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors if not properly addressed.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable living situation, past mental health issues, and a belief system that doesn't offer support\u2014all point towards high risk. So I'd assign each factor as high relative weight.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"High risk due to four arrests and two convictions indicating past trouble which may affect future behavior.\"),\n    (\"unstable_living_condition\", \"high\", \"Living alone and not married increases vulnerability to stress and risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"low_education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college can hinder positive integration and support seeking.\"),\n    (\"limited_job_history\", \"high\", \"Only one job may lead to economic instability and increased stress contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"past_mental_health_issues\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of depression suggest underlying mental health issues that could impede recovery without proper support.\"),\n    (\"negative RELIGIOUS Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Believing in no higher power may lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
