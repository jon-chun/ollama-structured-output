    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the risk factors for this 18-year-old male regarding rearrest recidivism. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and convictions. That's a significant criminal record, which definitely increases his risk of reoffending. So that's high.\n\nHe's Black, but I don't think race is directly a factor here unless there are systemic issues, but since the user hasn't mentioned anything about that, maybe it's not relevant for this assessment.\n\nHis height and weight aren't factors related to recidivism, so probably low.\n\nNot being married and living alone might indicate instability, which could contribute to higher risk. That's medium.\n\nLack of a high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete basic education, which is often linked to lower self-esteem and substance abuse. That's medium as well.\n\nHe held only one job recently, which suggests limited economic stability. Also medium.\n\nNo recent drug use but some deep-down lows. While not using drugs now, the emotional state could affect his behavior. Medium risk.\n\nYoung age at arrest (18) might mean less life experience and higher impulsivity, increasing the risk. High.\n\nHe lived in a household of four when young, which doesn't directly relate to recidivism but could indicate family dynamics; maybe high, medium, or low? Since it's just size without more info, perhaps medium.\n\nBelieving God has no role in his life might affect his motivation and relationships, potentially increasing risk. High.\n\nPutting it all together: four factors are high (arrests, age, living with family, belief in lack of divine involvement). Two are medium (not married/living alone, lack of education). None low except for height/weight which don't contribute.\n\nThe model I'm using is that each high factor significantly increases the risk. With multiple high factors here, it's quite likely he'll reoffend within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"He has a history of four arrests and convictions, which significantly increases his risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age_at_arrest\", \"high\", \"At 18 years old, he may exhibit higher impulsivity and fewer life experiences compared to older individuals.\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"He lived in a household of size 4 at a young age; however, this does not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"His lack of a high school diploma or GED may contribute to behavioral issues but is not the primary factor here.\"),\n    (\"current_living arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living alone is a minor factor compared to other aspects like criminal history and education level.\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"high\", \"He has felt low for some time, which could impact his decision-making and risk-taking behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
