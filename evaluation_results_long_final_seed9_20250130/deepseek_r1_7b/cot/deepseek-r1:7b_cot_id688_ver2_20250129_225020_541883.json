    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 21. Younger individuals might have less life experience, but she has a conviction already, which is significant. It's more about her current circumstances than her age.\n\nEducation level: She has an associate degree and is in college for two years. College completion usually correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism, so that should be low risk.\n\nMarital status: She's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can affect support systems, but since she's not married, maybe less of a factor compared to someone who's cohabiting or in a relationship.\n\nOccupation: She held one job during the year. Having a steady job is usually positive for recidivism because it provides income and stability. So that's low risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both negative and neutral effects depending on other factors like support or treatment. Here, she hasn't felt depressed lately, so maybe lower risk compared to someone who is struggling with drug use now.\n\n household size at a young age: She lived in a household of four when younger. Bigger households often provide more support, but since her household was four years ago and she's now living alone, that factor might not be as significant now.\n\nGod involvement: She believes God has something to do with her life. Belief in higher power can sometimes lead to better decision-making or stronger moral support, so maybe a bit lower risk here compared to someone who doesn't have such beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together: All factors are either low or medium positive indicators of non-recidivism. The only thing that might raise a little concern is her past drug use, but she hasn't felt depressed recently, which suggests she's managing the situation well. So overall, I think she has a lower risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nThe 21-year-old female exhibits several factors associated with lower recidivism. Her education and current employment indicate stability, while her living situation doesn't show significant distress from past circumstances. Her controlled drug use and positive recent emotional state further mitigate risks. While her age is a consideration, it's outweighed by her proactive steps.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 21 years old might suggest less life experience but she has a prior conviction which could be significant.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has completed an associate degree and is currently enrolled in a two-year college, indicating stability and potential job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone without being married does not necessarily indicate instability as long as she has support systems.\"),\n    (\"Occupation During the Year\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year suggests steady income and life direction which are positive indicators for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana, but not feeling depressed recently, indicates she is managing her substance use without severe emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living with three others when younger does not necessarily correlate with current issues as she has since moved out and is living alone.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence on Her Life\", \"low\", \"Believing in higher power can lead to better decision-making or stronger moral support, which are positive factors for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
