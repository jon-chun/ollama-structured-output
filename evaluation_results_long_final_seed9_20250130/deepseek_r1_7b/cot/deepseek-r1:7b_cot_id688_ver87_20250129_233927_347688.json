    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which isn't super high for recidivism, but she's still young. She's White, and there might be some racial disparities in the justice system, so that could be a medium factor.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That's significant because re-arresting after being convicted is a clear risk indicator. So that's definitely high.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; maybe they were included for other factors but not applicable to recidivism in this case.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which might mean she has fewer social supports, so another medium factor.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is still in college. College completion can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism, especially if it's a 2-year college. So that could be low or maybe medium depending on the context.\n\nShe worked one job last year. Employment generally reduces recidivism because having income can provide stability. So that might be low.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially recent, is a risk factor for relapse and possible illegal activity. Since she's not currently feeling depressed, maybe it's less of an immediate risk, but still present as medium.\n\nHer household size at a young age was 4, which might indicate family instability or higher risk factors from the past, so that could be medium.\n\nBelief in God: this is subjective and more about personal circumstances. It doesn't directly affect recidivism rates much, so probably low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), drug use (medium), and living situation (medium) are the main factors pushing her towards a high risk. The rest of the factors seem to either mitigate or not significantly contribute. So overall, she's moderately at risk but leaning towards higher due to prior arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"An individual with a prior conviction is inherently more likely to reoffend, especially if they have not regained stability or support after their release.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can lead to relapse and is a known risk factor for recidivism, although the lack of recent feelings of depression may suggest abstinence.
