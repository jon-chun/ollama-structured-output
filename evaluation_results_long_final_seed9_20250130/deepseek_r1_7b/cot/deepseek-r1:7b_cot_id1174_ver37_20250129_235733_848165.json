    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a solid indicator of past issues; more convictions usually mean higher risk. So that's high.\n\nHe's only 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I don't think height or weight alone predict much here unless there's something else, but in this case, it's just his size.\n\n living with someone alone is a red flag because lone living can lead to isolation which might contribute to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Without education, he might not have the skills needed for better opportunities, increasing the chance of reoffending.\n\nHe's only worked one job in a year. Job instability is often linked to higher recidivism rates because it shows he might be struggling financially or with career goals.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive but not sure how significant that is compared to other factors like prior convictions and living situation.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood, where he couldn't find anything to cheer him up, could indicate depression. Depression can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors which might contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age. A bigger family might have different dynamics that could either help or hurt him; not sure if it's positive here.\n\nHis lack of belief in God could mean he has different coping mechanisms, perhaps more rebellious, and might face higher stress without religious support.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple past convictions (high), living alone (medium?), no education (high), unstable job (medium?), recent negative mood (maybe medium), drug-free but recent low mood. So overall high risk because of the multiple factors like prior convictions, living situation, lack of education, and possible mental health issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"single_living\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, potential stressors, and increased risk of substance abuse or other risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"low_education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma/GED indicates limited educational opportunities and could contribute to lower employability and higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"unstable_job\", \"medium\", \"Only working one job in a year may indicate job instability, which can be linked to financial stress or unmet needs that might lead to reoffending\"),\n    (\"recent_mood\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of low mood without any positive triggers could indicate potential mental health issues, which may contribute to risky behaviors or substance use\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
