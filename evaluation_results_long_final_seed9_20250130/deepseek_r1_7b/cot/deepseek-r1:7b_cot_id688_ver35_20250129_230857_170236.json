    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me break down each factor she has.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she's already been arrested once. That could be a red flag because younger individuals sometimes have fewer life experiences and might make impulsive decisions. So that might push her risk up a bit.\n\nShe identifies as White, and while race can influence recidivism rates in some areas, since she was convicted of a crime, it does factor into the assessment. But given she's only 21, maybe the impact isn't too high yet.\n\nHeight is 6 feet 1 inch\u2014she seems tall\u2014but I don't think physical characteristics like height are typically considered in risk assessments unless there's evidence of prior issues related to size, which there isn't here.\n\nWeight is 163 lbs. Again, weight alone doesn't predict much without other factors like BMI or health issues, so maybe that doesn't contribute much.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which sometimes leads people to turn to substances when they're stressed or having a bad day. That could increase the risk of drug use, which she has done in the past four years.\n\nShe has a GED from junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. So her education might actually lower her risk here.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year. Job stability is important; having multiple jobs or consistent employment can provide financial stability and reduce stress, which might lead to substance use. One job might not be enough for her, so that could increase the risk a bit.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use, especially if it's related to stress or mental health issues, can sometimes be a sign of underlying problems that need treatment but doesn't directly predict future drug use unless she's using it recreationally now.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health is important, recent happiness or lack thereof isn't necessarily predictive unless there's evidence of ongoing issues.\n\nYoung household size\u2014she lived with four people when young. Larger households can provide more support and reduce stress, so that might actually lower her risk compared to someone living alone at a younger age.\n\nShe believes in God. This is a personal belief, but I don't think religious beliefs directly impact recidivism unless there's evidence of sin or moral issues, which isn't provided here.\n\nPutting it all together: She has one prior arrest and convictions, which are negative factors. She's living alone, which could increase stress leading to drug use. Her job situation is unstable with only one job. Education is good, but she's using marijuana. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, so that might indicate she's in better mental health now.\n\nThe presence of prior drug use and current instability in employment could increase her risk slightly. The lack of a strong support network from her household when young might have contributed to issues earlier on. So maybe it's a medium risk because there are some mitigating factors like education, but also some concerning signs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Her age of 21 and one prior arrest may indicate higher risk due to impulsive decisions despite being in a young adult phase.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, potentially increasing substance use or stress which might correlate with higher drug use rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium\", \"Only holding one job during the year may indicate lower financial stability and increased stress, but her current enrollment in college could provide future opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and enrolled in college suggests she has access to education which generally correlates with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years can sometimes indicate underlying issues that may or may not correlate with current substance use.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Recent State\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests she is managing her mental health effectively currently, though this does not negate past issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of four when young may have provided support and reduced stress factors contributing to current issues rather than increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God is a personal choice that does not directly correlate with recidivism unless there are moral or sin-related issues, which are not indicated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
