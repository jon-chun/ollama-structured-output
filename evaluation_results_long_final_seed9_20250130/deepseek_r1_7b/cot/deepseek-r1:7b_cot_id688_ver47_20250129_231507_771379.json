    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Young adults can sometimes be more impulsive and less likely to get involved in criminal activities again because they're still developing their judgment. So that might lower the risk a bit.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but with only one conviction and being young, her race alone probably isn't a huge factor here unless she has other factors tied to race, which I don't see yet.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because having a prior conviction increases the risk of reoffending. But since it's just one time, maybe not as high as someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't see how physical attributes directly affect recidivism unless there's something about her behavior tied to them, but in this case, I don't have information on that.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone.\u5355\u8eab\u751f\u6d3b\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u793e\u4ea4\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f4621\u5c81\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u5728\u6821\u56ed\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u719f\u6089\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\u3002\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is in a 2-year program. Education can help with job opportunities and skills, which might reduce recidivism. But if she's not completing her studies, maybe that's a concern.\n\nShe worked one job during the year. One job isn't terrible, but having some income could provide motivation to change behavior. However, sometimes having a job doesn't necessarily lead to positive outcomes unless there's evidence of substance abuse or other issues.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can be a risk factor because it can lead to underlying issues like addiction that might make reoffending more likely. But since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe she's managed her use well.\n\nShe feels no depression over the past month. If she's not dealing with mental health issues, that could reduce the risk of using drugs or engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nYoung household at age: living with three other people might have provided support and stability. If she had a larger household before, maybe she's more likely to get support now.\n\nBelieves in God. Religious factors can sometimes correlate with substance use or criminal behavior due to underlying beliefs about sin or punishment. But if she's feeling good about her current life, it might mitigate that risk.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest is a strong indicator of higher risk, but she has some mitigating factors like education and stable living situation. Her drug use in the past four years with no recent depression symptoms could be a moderate risk factor. However, since she's 21 and still in college, maybe her motivation to change is high.\n\nSo overall, I'd say there's a medium to low risk of rearrest compared to someone with more prior issues or unstable living conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"Having one prior arrest is a moderate risk factor as it indicates a history of criminal behavior, but the individual is young and may have changed circumstances.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"medium\", \"Completing associate/junior college and currently enrolled in a 2-year program reduces recidivism risk but could be influenced by external factors like drug use or personal challenges.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_4yrs\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana, may increase risk but there's no recent evidence of depression, suggesting she might be managing her situation better.\"),\n    (\"single_living\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 21 suggests a focus on education or work, which could positively influence recidivism risk compared to living with multiple family members\"),\n    (\"degree_in_progress\", \"medium\", \"Having an associate/junior college degree and pursuing further education can reduce risk but may be influenced by other factors like drug use or personal issues\"),\n    (\"past_month_depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression symptoms suggest she is in a better mental state, which could mitigate substance use and criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"household_size_at_age\", \"low\", \"Living with three others at a young age may indicate a stable environment that could provide support against reoffending risks\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may correlate with responsible behavior but this alone doesn't directly contribute to recidivism risk if she's actively seeking help or is motivated by personal goals\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
