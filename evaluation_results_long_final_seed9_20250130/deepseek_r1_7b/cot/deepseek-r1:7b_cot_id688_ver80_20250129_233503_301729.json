    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a complex task as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. The user provided detailed information about a 21-year-old female, and I need to assign each risk factor a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014and then predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors one by one. She has only been arrested once and is convicted, which might indicate some past instability but isn't immediately alarming. Her age suggests she's still developing socially, so that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's White, which in some contexts can influence perceptions of recidivism based on race, though I need to consider if there are disparities here. Her height and weight don't directly relate to risk factors, but maybe her BMI could be relevant; however, since she's enrolled in college, that might not be an issue.\n\nShe's living alone, which is a positive indicator as living with family usually offers support. She hasn't been married yet, so that's another pro-risk factor because relationships can sometimes reduce recidivism through emotional support or better decision-making.\n\nCompleting associate/junior college and currently in a 2-year program shows she has some education but might be motivated to complete it, which could lead to better job opportunities\u2014maybe reducing risk. She only held one job recently; part-time work is common and doesn't necessarily correlate with high recidivism unless there's unemployment or instability.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. While substance abuse can be a risk factor when it leads to illegal activities, here she admitted to using it without any mention of severe issues, so maybe this isn't as high a risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive\u2014depression sometimes correlates with self-harm or other risky behaviors but she's avoided that. Her household size at a young age was four, which might indicate family support, reducing risk compared to larger households later on.\n\nBelieving in God could be a protective factor as spirituality often provides coping mechanisms and reduces stress from substance abuse or other issues.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: low medium high for each:\n\n1. Age - Low\n2. Race - Low (but aware of potential disparities)\n3. Drug use - Medium? Maybe because occasional use without severe consequences isn't a strong risk.\n4. Depression - Low since she hasn't felt it and avoids self-harm.\n5. Household size at young age - High protective, so maybe low risk overall.\n6. Spirituality - High protective.\n\nLooking at the collective factors, her only recent arrest is probably leading to some risk due to possible unstable situation or past issues. Her education and current studies are positive. She's young, single, living alone\u2014these might mitigate risks.\n\nBut considering she has a past conviction, that could still be a significant risk factor if she's not actively working on her issues. Her drug use and lack of depression don't directly point to high recidivism but might not add much either.\n\nPutting it all together: She's likely to have low to medium risk. Given the positive factors like education, living alone, spirituality, and recent lack of severe depression or substance issues, I lean towards low confidence she'll rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, a relatively young age that may indicate stability and reduced risk factors related to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can influence perceptions of recidivism rates, this individual's White background does not inherently increase risk without additional context or systemic factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \" occasional drug use (marijuana) does not necessarily correlate with high levels of risk unless it leads to substance abuse issues that may affect behavior.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"The individual has not felt depressed in the past month and avoids self-harm, indicating a positive mental health stance that may reduce risk factors associated with depression or anxiety.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"high protective\", \"Living in a household of 4 at a young age suggests family support, which is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"high protective\", \" Believing that God has something to do with one's personal life often provides coping mechanisms and emotional support, reducing risk factors associated with stress or substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 10\n}\n```",
