    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female with various factors contributing to her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might indicate she's still developing skills and habits that could impact her reoffending potential. Since she's been convicted once before, past criminal history does suggest some recidivism risk, but at a lower base rate compared to older individuals or those with multiple convictions.\n\nHer height (6ft1in) and weight (163 lbs) don't seem directly related to recidivism unless there's an underlying health issue. However, her BMI is about 20, which isn't particularly high, so no significant risk from that aspect.\n\nLiving alone might be a mitigating factor since isolation can lead to higher stress and substance use, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee lower risk without considering other factors like mental health or drug use history.\n\nHer education level: associate degree completed and currently enrolled in another. College education is generally protective against recidivism because of the skills learned and stability provided by educational institutions.\n\nEmployment history shows she held one job last year, which is positive as joblessness can increase criminal activity due to unstable situations. However, not being employed might also mean she's avoiding certain risky environments.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) could be problematic if she's using other substances or if there's a pattern of substance abuse.Marijuana use alone doesn't guarantee higher risk but could indicate potential for other drug issues that may affect behavior.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign. However, without information on prior mental health issues, this factor remains neutral.\n\nPast household size at young age was four, which might suggest she was in an environment with more supervision or perhaps higher levels of emotional support that could have protective effects against recidivism if she's now living alone but those factors are no longer present.\n\nHer spiritual beliefs (believing in God) can sometimes provide a sense of direction and accountability, acting as a protective factor against self-harm or substance abuse. It might help her stay on track rather than engage in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting all these together: The educational background is strong, which lowers the risk. Employment history also helps. Age might slightly increase the risk compared to older individuals but she's still young. Drug use could be a concern if it's part of a pattern, but only marijuana mentioned. Living alone without prior support could be an issue, but she's young and has some positive factors.\n\nGiven all these, I think her risk is low overall because of her education, employment, and positive mental health aspects. However, the past drug use might introduce some uncertainty if she's using other substances or relapsing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age may indicate developing skills that could impact reoffending potential but at a lower base rate compared to older individuals.\"),\n    (\"Conviction History\", \"medium\", \"One prior conviction suggests some recidivism risk, but it's mitigated by positive factors like education and employment.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Isolation may lead to stress or substance use issues without further context on mental health or drug use patterns.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Completed associate degree and currently enrolled; higher education is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held one job last year, which could reduce risk but may also indicate avoiding risky environments if unemployed.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use alone doesn't guarantee high risk without other substance patterns or a history of drug-related issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"neutral\", \"No depression in past month, but no prior mental health information to assess potential issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"neutral\", \"Past household size of four may have had protective effects now that she lives alone without support.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believes in God, which can provide accountability and help stay on track but not a definitive protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
