    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. She has one prior arrest and is now being considered for rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst, her age might be a positive factor since she\u2019s relatively young, but she does have a criminal history which could weigh her down. Next, her race is White; I know that racial disparities exist in the justice system, so that's something to consider as a mitigating or aggravating factor depending on context.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Her height isn't an immediate red flag but combined with her weight might suggest she has health issues which could affect recidivism, though that\u2019s speculative here.\n\nLiving alone is another point\u2014being in a shared residence can provide support, so that's a mitigating factor. She hasn\u2019t been married and is single, which again points towards less risk due to family support.\n\nHer education level: associate degree or junior college completed but still enrolled. Some studies suggest lower education levels might correlate with higher recidivism rates, so that could be a risk factor.\n\nEmployment history shows she has one job in the past year. Unemployment can contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors, which are known predictors of recidivism.\n\nDrug use: she's used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential for relapse or further illegal activities, so this should be considered a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. While depression can sometimes lead to substance abuse, her lack of recent depression might suggest better mental health and lower risk.\n\nLiving with a household of four at a young age could indicate family support but also potential challenges which aren't directly clear in terms of risk without more info.\n\nHer belief in God suggests strong moral values, which are generally positive indicators for recidivism as they promote good behavior.\n\nPutting all this together: one prior arrest (medium), White race (neutral/no direct impact on risk beyond systemic issues), living alone (low mitigating), education level (moderate mitigating but could be a risk if not applied properly), job history (low mitigating), marijuana use (high risk factor), no recent depression (low risk mitigated by positive mental health). \n\nConsidering all factors, the overall prediction leans towards high risk due to the presence of significant risk factors like prior arrest and drug use. The confidence is relatively high because despite some mitigating factors, there are clear indicators that suggest higher recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Having a prior arrest can increase the likelihood of recidivism as individuals with criminal history often face additional barriers to reintegration and may engage in riskier behaviors.\"),\n    (\"White Race\", \"low\", \"Racial considerations are complex, but White individuals can have varying outcomes based on systemic factors that are beyond individual control.
