    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Young adults are generally at a lower risk of recidivism compared to older individuals who have more life experience and may face higher stress or challenges. So that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. From what I remember, race can influence recidivism rates, but it's not the only factor. She has one prior arrest and conviction, which is moderate. While this does increase her risk, being only one offense might not be too high compared to others with multiple convictions.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs. I don't know much about how physical characteristics affect recidivism directly, but maybe if she's underweight or overweight, that could play a role, but here it seems normal. So probably no significant impact\u2014maybe low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Being single and living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which might contribute to substance use or other behaviors. But since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe this isn't a major issue now. Still, it could be a contributing factor but not extremely high.\n\nEducation: Associate/Junior College completed and currently enrolled in 2-year college. Education generally reduces recidivism risk because it provides skills and opportunities for better job prospects. However, being still enrolled might indicate she's motivated to get a degree, which is positive\u2014but maybe medium risk since some factors like motivation can vary.\n\nOccupation: One job during the year. Having stable employment is usually good for reducing recidivism. If she has a meaningful job, it likely contributes positively. So probably low or medium depending on other factors.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both positive and negative outcomes. While using drugs might indicate some level of substance abuse, not feeling depressed could suggest she's managing her use without severe issues. Maybe a medium risk factor because occasional use isn't as bad as chronic use.\n\nReligion: She believes God has something to do with her life. Religious involvement can provide support and reduce stress, which might positively influence recidivism rates. So that's probably a low or maybe medium positive factor depending on how it's integrated into her life.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest is moderate, education is good but still enrolled, single living situation could be a bit of a risk due to isolation. Drug use in the past isn't severe, so maybe not too high. Overall, I think she has some factors that are slightly increasing her risk, but nothing extremely high.\n\nSo my prediction would lean towards low risk with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor provided for the 21-year-old female, here is a structured assessment:\n\n- **Age**: Low risk due to being in her prime years without significant life challenges.\n- **Race**: White, no specific impact but not a contributing factor in this case.\n- **Prior Arrest/Conviction**: Moderate risk with one prior offense.\n- **Physical Characteristics**: No significant impact on recidivism as she appears healthy.\n- **Marital Status/Living Alone**: Potential for increased isolation leading to substance use; however, she hasn't felt depressed recently.\n- **Education**: Positive influence from education but still enrolled in college.\n- **Occupation**: Stable job which reduces risk.\n- **Drug Use**: Occasional use without severe depression suggests manageable use.\n- **Religion**: Positive influence through spiritual support.\n\nConsidering all factors, the overall assessment concludes:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults generally have lower recidivism risk compared to older individuals with life experience and stress.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"\", \"White does not significantly impact this individual's recidivism risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"moderate\", \"One prior arrest increases risk but is manageable.\",\n     \"moderate\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"\", \"Normal height and weight do not contribute to increased risk.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with a young age may lead to feelings of isolation potentially linked to substance use behavior.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Currently enrolled in college, which positively influences recidivism risk.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Occupation\", \"low\", \"One job during the year provides stability and reduces risk of recidivism.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \" occasional marijuana use without recent depression suggests manageable behavior.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"\", \"Belief in God may provide support, reducing stress and influencing positive outcomes.\",\n     \"\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
