    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nShe's White, which doesn't directly impact her risk here unless there's some societal bias involved in the system, but I don't have information to suggest that yet. Her age is 21, which is relatively young, so she might still be developing her skills and could potentially turn things around, but that also means she's less likely to have significant recidivism if she does make a mistake.\n\nShe stands at 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Weight doesn't typically play a significant role in risk assessment unless there are health concerns, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone is another factor. Living with family can provide support and reduce stress, so living alone might slightly increase her risk compared to others, but it's not the most critical factor.\n\nShe has an associate degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because of better job prospects and life skills. So this should be low or medium risk depending on other factors.\n\nShe's been employed for one job during the year, which isn't great but not terrible either. Employment can help with financial stability and reducing substance abuse issues, so that might mitigate some risk.\n\nDrug use history: she used marijuana in the past four years. marijuana use is often linked to criminal behavior and could indicate higher risk of substance abuse issues leading to more crimes. This should be a medium or high factor.\n\nHer depression status: she hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which suggests she's mentally stable. Mental health is a positive factor for lower recidivism rates.\n\nYoung household size at age: she lived with four people when young, which might have provided stability and support during tough times, potentially reducing risk factors then that could persist now.\n\nHer belief in God: this is more of a personal factor related to her mental state. If she's religiously inclined, it might indicate strong moral values, but I'm not sure how that translates into recidivism rates directly.\n\nPutting all these together: the key factors are the prior arrest and conviction (high risk), drug use history (medium-high risk), and maybe a slightly negative aspect from living alone. Education is positive, but her job experience isn't great either. Her mental health seems good. \n\nSo overall, considering the prior convictions and drug use, she's in a high risk category with some mitigating factors like education and no recent depression. But recidivism can still happen even if there are mitigating factors, especially if she has ongoing substance abuse issues or other underlying problems.\n\nI think her relative weight should be medium to high because of the prior offense and drug use, but not extremely high since she's got some positive attributes like education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"A single arrest and conviction significantly increase recidivism risk due to established criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use may indicate potential substance abuse issues contributing to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Employed for one job during the year can provide stability and reduce negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in college with an associate degree suggests proactive educational engagement and reduced risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age\", \"low\", \"Living with four people at a young age may have provided support, potentially mitigating long-term risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
