    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a high criminal history with four arrests and convictions. That sounds like a strong indicator of higher risk because reoffending is more likely when someone has a history of breaking the law.\n\nHis weight and height might not directly impact his risk unless there are behavioral factors associated with that, but I don't see any info suggesting he's at risk based on his physical stats.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse. Living situation can influence support networks, which might reduce recidivism. But since he's a young adult with no kids, maybe the support is minimal. However, being single could mean less supervision and higher chance of making poor decisions again.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he has limited educational opportunities. Without education, it's harder for him to find better job prospects, increasing the risk of re-entering the criminal system.\n\nHe held only one job in the past year. Job instability can lead to financial strain and substance abuse issues, both of which are linked to recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years but had a bad emotional week. While he's clean now, recent stress might affect his mental health, possibly leading to relapse or increased risk factors if the stress escalates.\n\nYoung age (18) and growing up in a household of four could mean less parental supervision and more exposure to negative influences, which is a red flag for recidivism.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might indicate a higher materialism or risk-seeking attitude. This could lead to substance abuse or engaging in risky behaviors that contribute to criminal activity.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple factors point towards high risk. The history of arrests, limited education, unemployment, living alone, and other personal factors all contribute significantly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"He has a high criminal history with four arrests and convictions, which indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age_and household\", \"medium\", \"Living at 18 years old in a household of size 4 might indicate less supervision but could also be a place of exposure to negative influences, contributing moderately to risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"He has never been married or is currently living alone without a high school diploma or GED, which could limit opportunities and increase risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"He has held only one job during the year, which may indicate instability and increased vulnerability to substance abuse or emotional issues that can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"low\", \"While he hasn't used drugs in four years, some of the time during the past month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up, indicating potential emotional instability which could contribute to risk but not as significantly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"religion_and_values\", \"low\", \"He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally, which might indicate a certain level of self-direction or lack thereof, contributing minimally to risk compared to other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
