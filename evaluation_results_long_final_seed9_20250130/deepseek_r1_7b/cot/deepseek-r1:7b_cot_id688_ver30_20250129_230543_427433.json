    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger than 25 might be considered low risk initially, but factors like substance use could change that.\n\nShe's White, which isn't a direct risk factor, but it's more about the context of systemic issues rather than her personal behavior.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction. A single prior is not terrible, but convictions can sometimes indicate higher risk if they're for serious offenses, though I don't know what this arrest was for.\n\nHer height (6'1\") and weight (163 lbs) are physical attributes; nothing jumps out as concerning here.\n\nLiving alone could be a risk factor because isolation might lead to issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. She's never married and living alone adds to that.\n\nShe has an associate degree, which is good, but she's currently in college. Education can help reduce recidivism if it leads to better job opportunities and financial stability.\n\nOne job during the year isn't a lot, but stable employment can be beneficial. It shows some commitment and responsibility.\n\nDrug use past four years (marijuana only) could indicate potential substance abuse issues, which is concerning for recidivism.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month seems positive, but it's important to consider if she has ongoing mental health issues that aren't reported.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to factors like instability or substance use.\n\nBelieving in God might suggest religious coping mechanisms, which could be protective against some negative outcomes, but it's not directly related to recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest and current drug use are red flags. Her living situation at a young age and potential isolation could also contribute. The other factors like education and stable job aren't strong mitigators here. So the overall risk seems medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21, which might be considered low risk initially, but factors like substance use could change that.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and could have ongoing issues with substance abuse, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone at 21 might indicate isolation, which is a known risk factor for substance abuse and other behavioral issues that can lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has completed an associate degree and is currently enrolled in college.
