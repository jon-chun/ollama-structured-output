    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male regarding rearrest recidivism over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's Black. I remember that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues and biased law enforcement practices. So that's a high relative weight.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once before. Multiple prior convictions are strong indicators of higher risk because they show a history of breaking laws, which could lead to more criminal behavior again. That's definitely high.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches, but I don't think that factor alone contributes much; it might not be relevant unless combined with other factors like weight or occupation.\n\nHe weighs 145 lbs, but again, without context on his activity level or how he handles stress, this isn't significant. Maybe if he's underweight and unhealthy, but there's no info here about that.\n\nLiving alone doesn't directly indicate risk, but combined with other factors like not having a job or education, it could imply instability. But alone itself might be medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests he has limited educational opportunities, which can lead to poor decision-making. That's a high factor.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone, so no relationships for support system. Unstable living situation increases risk, so high weight.\n\nHeld only one job during the year. Jobless status can lead to dependency on welfare or other resources, increasing recidivism chances\u2014high relative weight.\n\nNo drug use in past four years, which is positive. But sometimes not using anything might be a sign of complacency; maybe he's avoiding help if needed. Still, no direct link but high weight because of lack of substance abuse issues.\n\nMental health: He felt down for most of the month and nothing helped him. This could lead to self-harm or increased risk-taking behavior. That's definitely high.\n\nYoung age at 18 with past convictions\u2014adolescent decisions can be impulsive, so higher risk because he's still developing judgment. High weight.\n\nLiving in a household of four might mean more supervision but if it's chaotic, could also mean lack of control. However, without info on the family environment, I'll consider it medium relative to other factors.\n\nBelieving God has no role in his life\u2014this could impact motivation towards good behavior or seeking help from religious support systems, so higher risk.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, lack of education, living alone, limited job, mental health issues, and age. These are strong indicators for high relative weight each.\n</think>\n\nThe individual exhibits several high-risk factors including multiple prior convictions, limited educational background, living in a solitary situation, joblessness, mental health challenges, and an impulsive demeanor typical of youth. These factors collectively suggest a high likelihood of recidivism within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple prior convictions\", \"high\", \"Past criminal history increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior due to established patterns of lawbreaking and lack of responsibility]),\n    (\"Limited educational background\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can lead to limited opportunities for positive development, increasing risk of engaging in risky behaviors again\")),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to feelings of isolation and stress but without additional context about living conditions or support systems it is considered medium relative to other factors like joblessness or mental health issues which are more directly linked to recidivism risk\")),\n    (\"Joblessness\", \"high\", \"Not having a job can lead to dependency on welfare or other resources, increasing the likelihood of engaging in behaviors that may contribute to recidivism such as drug use or poor decision-making\")),\n    (\"Mental health issues\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of low mood and lack of effective coping mechanisms can increase stress levels and willingness to engage in risky or impulsive behaviors which may lead to criminal acts or reoffending\")),\n    (\"Adolescent decision making\", \"high\", \"Youth at 18 years old with prior convictions is often marked by decisions made without full consideration of consequences increasing the likelihood of future criminal behavior due to impulsivity and lack of life experience in navigating complex social situations\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
