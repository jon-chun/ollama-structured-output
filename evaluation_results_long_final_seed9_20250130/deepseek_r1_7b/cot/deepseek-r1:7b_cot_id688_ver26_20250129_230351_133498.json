    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old female. Let me break down her profile step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young but not too old. Young people often have different behaviors compared to older adults, and their recidivism rates can be influenced by factors like education or employment stability. Since she's currently enrolled in college and planning on working part-time, that might help reduce the risk.\n\nShe has a White ethnicity, which could be a consideration because there are studies suggesting that race plays a role in recidivism rates, though it's not always straightforward. However, without more specific data about her community or prior experiences with law enforcement, I can't say for sure how much this factor contributes to her risk.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction, which might be significant. A prior conviction, even if it's minor, can impact recidivism rates because of possible stigma or higher risk-taking behavior after release. But since she only has one offense, maybe the weight isn't too high.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and she weighs 163 lbs. This information might be relevant for assessing potential risks related to physical health, like substance use or other behaviors that could lead to legal issues. She's used marijuana in the past four years, which could increase the risk of drug-related offenses or unintended consequences.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates, she's reported no depression recently, so this might actually lower her risk. Maybe she's mentally stable enough to make positive choices post-release.\n\nCurrently living alone could have implications in terms of social support and stability. Living alone can be risky because there are fewer people to rely on for help or safety if something goes wrong. However, with proper support systems like a college or community resources, this might not pose an extremely high risk.\n\nShe's never been married and is 21 years old, so she has time ahead of her to build relationships and potentially reduce risk factors associated with relying on others for emotional or financial support.\n\nEducation-wise, she has completed associate or junior college and is attending a 2-year college. Higher education levels are generally associated with lower recidivism rates because they provide more opportunities and skills that can help in re-entering society positively.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. While having some work experience might be beneficial, it's not an extensive background in employment. One job isn't enough to fully transition into adulthood without supervision or additional support systems.\n\nHer use of marijuana over the past four years indicates potential substance abuse issues. Substance misuse can lead to further legal problems and increase the likelihood of reoffending if not properly addressed.\n\nShe considers God as something that affects her personal life, which might suggest she's religiously oriented. This belief could either provide a sense of structure or support for her behavior but could also influence decision-making in risky situations.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are present (1), but it's only one offense. Her living situation is alone, which might increase risk slightly. She uses marijuana and hasn't felt depressed recently, both factors that could contribute to higher recidivism if not managed well. However, she has a good educational background and age, which mitigates some of these risks.\n\nThe prior arrest is medium because it's present but not repeated.Marijuana use might be low or medium depending on context\u2014she hasn't used it recently, so maybe lower risk from that factor. Living alone could be high if she doesn't have support networks, but since she has a college to fall back on, perhaps it's mitigated.\n\nHer age and education would temper some of the higher factors like living alone or substance use. So overall, her risk might lean towards medium because there are both mitigating (education, age) and modulating (prior arrest is only once) factors.\n\nBut given that she has one prior offense, which could indicate a history of behavior that might not be fully controlled now, along with potential drug issues, the combined effect might push her into high risk. However, her education and being 21 are stabilizing factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age of 21 may influence recidivism rates due to behavior patterns typical in this demographic.
