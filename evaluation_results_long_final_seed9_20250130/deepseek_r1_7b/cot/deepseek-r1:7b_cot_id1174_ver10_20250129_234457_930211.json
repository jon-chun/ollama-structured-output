    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided a lot of details about an 18-year-old male with several risk factors, and they want each factor assigned a relative weight (low, medium, high) before predicting rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the information given. The person is Black, 18, arrested four times, convicted. He's 5'10\" and 145 lbs, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not in college. Only one job in a year, no drug use in past four years but had some bad mood. At young age, lived with four people, doesn't believe in God.\n\nI'll start by listing each factor the user provided and assess their risk impact.\n\n1. Age: 18 is considered high risk because it's early adulthood; more likely to have issues.\n2. Number of prior convictions: Four times convicted increases risk significantly since more history typically means higher recidivism.\n3. Education level: No HS diploma or GED shows lower education, which correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n4. Employment: Only one job in a year might indicate unstable situation, but maybe he's working minimum time; could be low to medium depending on how much support that provides.\n5. Drug use: No recent use is positive, but past mention of feeling low might relate to mental health issues, which can affect employment and stability.\n6. Religiosity: Doesn't believe in God could mean lack of religious guidance or support, potentially leading to emotional issues affecting behavior.\n7. Household size at young age: Lived with four people; maybe he felt more pressure, which could contribute to negative behavior.\n8. Current living situation: Living alone after possibly being a minor, but as an adult, it's neutral unless there are other factors.\n9. Mental health: Felt so down during the past month without any drug use\u2014this could indicate underlying mental health issues, increasing risk.\n\nNow, assigning each factor:\n\n- Age (high): 18 is early in life; higher chance of issues leading to more arrests.\n- Prior convictions (high): Four times, so high risk.\n- Education (high): No diploma typically correlates with higher recidivism.\n- Employment (medium): Only one job\u2014it's not nothing, but maybe support isn't strong enough.\n- Drug use (low): No recent use is positive, but past issues aren't directly tied to drug use mentioned here.\n- Religiosity (high): Lack of religious belief can lead to emotional issues affecting behavior.\n- Household size (high): Being with four people could have been stressful, contributing to negative outcomes.\n- Mental health (medium): Some low mood without drugs\u2014maybe not severe enough but still a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are age, prior convictions, education, religiosity, household size. Medium is employment and mental health. Low on drug use.\n\nFor the prediction, considering high recidivism due to four prior convictions, lack of education, living alone with potential stress from family, and mental health issues\u2014likely high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"18 is considered a high-risk age as it is early adulthood, making it more likely to experience issues that can lead to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending compared to individuals with fewer convictions.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED is associated with higher recidivism rates compared to those with higher levels of education.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the year may not provide enough stability or support, reducing the likelihood of reoffending but also not eliminating it completely.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is positive, but past experiences with mood issues may relate to underlying mental health rather than direct drug use.\"),\n    (\"Religiosity\", \"high\", \"Not believing in God could lead to a lack of guidance or support, potentially contributing to negative behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"high\", \"Living with four people at a young age may have contributed to stress or emotional issues that could persist and influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down without drug use may indicate underlying mental health issues that can affect behavior and stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
