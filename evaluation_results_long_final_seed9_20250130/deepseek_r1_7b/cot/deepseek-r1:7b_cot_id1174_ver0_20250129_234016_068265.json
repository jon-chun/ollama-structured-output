    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this risk assessment. So, the person is an 18-year-old Black male with four prior arrests and convictions. He's living alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, only one job, no drug use in the past four years, but he's feeling down sometimes.\n\nFirst, his age of 18 might mean he has fewer life experiences, which could affect his ability to make good decisions. Four arrests are definitely concerning\u2014higher risk. He's Black, and unfortunately, there's some racial disparity in the criminal justice system that could impact his outcomes.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, which might mean less support network for him, so if he gets into trouble again, he might not have people to help him. His lack of education is a big red flag\u2014he may struggle with basic skills necessary for success after incarceration.\n\nOnly one job suggests he doesn't have many opportunities or motivation beyond that single job. Not using drugs in the past four years is positive, but sometimes feeling down could lead to substance abuse or self-harm if he's not dealing with those emotions.\n\nHe used to live in a household of four at a young age, which might mean he was part of a larger family structure, so maybe he had more support then. Believing that God doesn't intervene personally is a strong indicator of lack of faith, which can affect his behavior and willingness to seek help.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors like prior convictions, lack of education, living alone with no support network, and sometimes feeling down could contribute to higher recidivism risk in the next three years. So, I'd lean towards a high relative weight for these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which may indicate fewer life experiences that could influence decision-making abilities and future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.
