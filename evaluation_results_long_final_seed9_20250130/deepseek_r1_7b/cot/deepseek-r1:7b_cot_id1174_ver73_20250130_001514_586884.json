    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's a strong indicator of past issues, which should definitely be high risk.\n\nHe's Black, but unfortunately, race can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates in some systems, so that might add to the risk as well.\n\nHis physical characteristics are average height and weight, which probably don't directly impact his risk. But he's living alone, which could mean less support system, possibly increasing the risk of not seeking help when needed.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities for better job prospects, so this is another high factor.\n\nOnly one job means limited income stability, which could affect his motivation or ability to change his situation. Plus, he's never married and living alone might contribute to feelings of loneliness that could lead to substance abuse issues if he's already showing some negative feelings towards himself.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but the mention of feeling down a lot recently is concerning. Could be indicative of deeper mental health issues or substance abuse problems, both of which are significant risk factors.\n\nAt a young age living with four people suggests he might have experienced family dysfunction or neglect, which can have long-term impacts on his behavior and ability to function successfully in society.\n\nHis lack of belief in God could affect his motivation towards positive change. Without religious support, he might not seek help or maintain positive values that are crucial for reintegration.\n\nPutting all these factors together, it's clear he has multiple red flags across different areas: criminal history, education, family background, mental health, and personal beliefs. These factors collectively point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and two convictions which is strongly associated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Racial background can be linked to higher recidivism rates in some systems, contributing to increased risk.\"),\n    (\"single_resident\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support and increase the likelihood of substance abuse or isolation issues.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not attending college are associated with lower employability and higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"jobless_state\", \"medium\", \"Currently employed only one job which might provide limited income stability but doesn't directly indicate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage_history\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use, though feelings of depression suggest possible substance abuse issues which are concerning but not directly linked to immediate risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Living with four family members at a young age indicates potential family dysfunction or neglect which can have long-term behavioral impacts.\"),\n    (\"religion Belief\", \"low\", \"No belief in God may affect personal motivation and support systems, though it's less directly linked to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
