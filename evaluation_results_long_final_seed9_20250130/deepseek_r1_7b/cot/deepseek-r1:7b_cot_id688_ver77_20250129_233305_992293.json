    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of a 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. She's White, has one prior arrest and conviction, is 6'1\" and 163 lbs, living alone, never married. Her education is associate or junior college, currently in a two-year college. She worked one job last year, used marijuana in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed in a month. Her household was size four when she was young, and she believes in God.\n\nFirst, I'll list all her risk factors based on each factor's impact. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\n1. **Age**: 21 is still relatively young, but having one prior offense could be significant. Young adults might be more likely to commit new offenses due to inexperience or impulsive decisions.\n   - Reasoning: Age is a minor factor here, but past offense increases risk.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Medium.\n\n2. **Race**: She's White. I know there are disparities in the criminal justice system regarding sentencing and recidivism based on race. However, this might be less significant compared to other factors like prior offenses or substance use.\n   - Reasoning: Race can influence risk assessment; however, without specific data linking her race to higher recidivism, it's a minor factor.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Low.\n\n3. **Height and Weight**: 6'1\" is tall and 163 lbs isn't that heavy for her height. Maybe she has underlying health issues? She hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe she's in good mental health or doesn't have a strong risk related to physical factors.\n   - Reasoning: Physical attributes might not directly correlate with recidivism unless there's an underlying condition, which isn't indicated here.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Low.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: She is living alone and never married. Single individuals may face different stressors or support systems that could either help or hinder her ability to commit a crime again.\n   - Reasoning: Being single doesn't inherently make someone more likely to reoffend, but it might influence her stability.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Low.\n\n5. **Education Level**: She has associate/junior college and is currently in a two-year program. College completion can lead to better job opportunities and reduced criminal tendencies.\n   - Reasoning: Education is usually protective against recidivism as it often leads to better career prospects, which can deter reoffending.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Low.\n\n6. **Employment**: She held one job last year. Employment, especially stable or higher-paying, is linked to lower recidivism rates because of financial stability and reduced motivation for illegal activities.\n   - Reasoning: Employment is protective; having a job can provide stability and reduce the need for alternative opportunities.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Low.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: She used marijuana in the past four years, but there's no mention of other drugs or alcohol.Marijuana use isn't typically classified as a severe offense compared to others like cocaine or meth, but it can still contribute to recidivism if she relapses.\n   - Reasoning: Past drug use could lead to substance abuse issues again, increasing risk.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Medium.\n\n8. **Mental Health**: She hasn't felt depressed in a month. If she had depression previously, it might affect her ability to commit crimes or seek help. Her current mental health is positive.\n   - Reasoning: Positive mental health can deter reoffending, but if there was prior mental health issues not addressed, that could be a concern.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Low.\n\n9. **Household Size at Young Age**: She lived with four people when young. Smaller households are often associated with lower recidivism rates as they provide more support and stability.\n   - Reasoning: Small household size is protective; more supervision can lead to better outcomes.\n   - Risk Factor Weight: Low.\n\n10. **Belief in God**: Her religious belief might influence her behavior, but it's a personal factor that doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like stress or belief in divine retribution affecting her decisions.\n    - Reasoning: Beliefs can impact decision-making but don't directly cause recidivism. Without evidence of related issues, it's low.\n    - Risk Factor Weight: Low.\n\nNow, I'll evaluate each factor:\n\n- Age: Medium risk due to being young and having a prior offense.\n- Prior Offense: High risk as one offense significantly increases the chance of reoffending.\n- Drug Use: Medium risk if it's occasional but could lead to relapse.\n- Employment: Low risk as she has some employment history, which is protective.\n- Education: Low risk because education usually helps in getting better jobs and reducing crime.\n- Household Size: Low risk due to living with others providing support.\n\nConsidering all factors, her high risk comes from the prior offense. Other factors are either protective or moderate risks. So, overall, she's at a medium-high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"21 is still relatively young but having one prior offense could be significant as young adults might be more likely to commit new offenses due to inexperience or impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"Prior Offense\", \"High\", \"Having a prior arrest and conviction significantly increases the chance of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"Medium\", \"Past marijuana use can contribute to substance abuse issues if she relapses, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"Low\", \"Holding one job last year provides stability which is linked to lower recidivism rates due to financial stability and reduced motivation for illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"Low\", \"Current education level in college is usually protective as it often leads to better job prospects reducing criminal tendencies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
