    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her race is White. Generally, there aren't significant racial disparities in recidivism rates in many studies, so that might not be a strong factor here.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses or reoffending.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism risk unless there's something about her physique indicating past behavior, but that doesn't apply here.\n\nShe\u2019s living alone, which is common among first-time offenders. Living alone might contribute to substance use because she's relying on herself, so that could be a risk factor related to drug use and potential self-harm.\n\nHer education level: associate degree or junior college completion plus ongoing college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates since it can provide better job opportunities and life skills.\n\nShe\u2019s employed one job in the past year; job stability is generally associated with lower risk of reoffending because having a steady income and social support network reduces stress and motivation for illegal activities.\n\nDrug use: she admitted to marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse is a major risk factor as it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to dangerous behavior.\n\nMental health: she hasn't felt depressed recently. Positive mental health status might be associated with lower recidivism rates because people who are happy may not engage in harmful behaviors.\n\nHer household size at a young age was four. A larger household might provide more support and stability, which could actually reduce risk, but it's less relevant than current living situation since she's now living alone.\n\nReligious belief: she believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to prosocial behaviors or higher self-control, but this isn't a strong indicator unless there's evidence of it in the context of substance use and other risk factors.\n\nPutting this all together, while some factors like prior arrest and drug use are significant, others like living alone might mitigate her risk. However, considering that she has a past conviction, which is a strong indicator, I'm leaning towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"A single prior arrest does not automatically predict recidivism, but it can be a contributing factor depending on other factors like substance use and living situation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past drug use (marijuana) is strongly associated with higher risk of reoffending due to impaired judgment and increased impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone, while common among first-time offenders, can sometimes be linked to substance use issues which may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Higher education levels are typically associated with lower recidivism rates and better life skills that can reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"medium\", \"Positive mental health in the past month may indicate a more stable individual, but it's less relevant than current living situation and substance use history.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Religious affiliation is not strongly linked to recidivism unless specific behaviors are observed which are not mentioned here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
