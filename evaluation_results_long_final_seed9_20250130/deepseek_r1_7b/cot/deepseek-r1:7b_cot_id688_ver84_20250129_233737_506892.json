    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which isn't too old but considering it's near adulthood, she might be more stable. But as a first-time offender, maybe that slightly reduces risk? Not sure yet.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there can be racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but with only one offense and being White, I'm not sure how much that affects her risk compared to others.\n\nShe has a high school diploma or associate's degree from junior college and is currently at a 2-year college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides more opportunities and stability. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone isn't great, but she's an only child maybe? No, wait, she's never married, so perhaps she has support from family or friends. Or maybe living alone increases stress or isolation. It's a bit unclear how much that affects her risk compared to others in similar situations.\n\nShe uses marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can affect mental health and decision-making. Since she hasn't felt depressed recently, it might not be severe, but drug use itself isn't a clear indicator of high recidivism unless there's a history of substance abuse leading to more crimes.\n\nNot feeling depressed for a month is positive, which could indicate better mental health or stress management. That's a good sign and lowers the risk.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can provide more support but might also have more dynamics that could be stressful. I'm not sure how this affects her personal stability now.\n\nHer belief in God is a positive trait, suggesting she has a strong moral compass or supportive religious environment. That usually reduces risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: She's young, educated, living perhaps with supportive family despite being alone, no severe drug issues, good mental health, and a positive outlook on life. All these points lean towards low recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is near adulthood (21 years old) which may indicate she has had time to reflect and potentially improve her situation.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma or associate's degree, which are typically associated with better job prospects and stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could be isolating, but since she is an only child (as indicated by never being married), it might not have as significant an impact compared to others in similar situations.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years.
