    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at a 21-year-old woman with several factors that could influence her risk of rearrest.\n\nFirst, her past criminal history: she has one arrest and is convicted. That's a solid red flag\u2014previous convictions are a major indicator of recidivism.\n\nHer age is 21; while this isn't a huge concern on its own, being in her mid-twenties might mean she's more established but still young enough to have recent life experiences that could affect behavior.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs. I don't see an immediate issue here unless there's a history of weight-related issues, which isn't indicated.\n\nMarital status and living situation: She's single and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors because she might be less monitored or have fewer support systems to turn to if things go wrong.\n\nEducation level: Associate degree and currently in college. College completion is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, but it also depends on how much time she's dedicating to studies versus other activities.\n\nEmployment history: She has one job during the year. Having some employment can provide stability, which might reduce recidivism, but having only one job could mean she's unemployed part of the time, increasing stress and possible substance use.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: She used marijuana. Drug use, especially recent or regular use, is a strong risk factor for reoffending because it can impair judgment, social skills, and increase tolerance to other drugs.\n\nMood: She hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While depression isn't directly linked to substance abuse, chronic depression can contribute to substance use and unstable behavior, which might affect her employment or living situation.\n\n household size at a young age: Four people. A larger household at a younger age could have provided more support and less stress, but it's not necessarily an indicator of current behavior unless there were issues within the family that she's avoiding now.\n\nHer belief in God: She thinks God is involved in her life. This might indicate a strong moral compass or perhaps a search for meaning, both of which can be positive factors if she uses them constructively to avoid harmful behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The key risk factors here are the previous conviction (high), past drug use (high), and living alone with limited support (medium). Her lack of education in terms of employment consistency might lower her score a bit, but the high factors from her past make her overall risk relatively high. Considering she's young, her belief in God might mitigate some risk, but it's not enough to completely offset everything.\n\nSo, my prediction is that she has a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor and their combined impact, here is the structured response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_conviction\", \"high\", \"She has one prior conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending as recidivism rates are strongly influenced by past criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"past_drug_use\", \"high\", \"Her use of marijuana in the past four years is a significant risk factor for future substance abuse and related offenses, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with limited support networks may increase stress and impulsive behaviors that could lead to substance use or other illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"age_and Employment_history\", \"low\", \"She is 21 years old and has one job, which suggests some stability. However, being in college indicates she might be dedicated to further education rather than engaging in risky behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
