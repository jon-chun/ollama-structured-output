    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I'm looking at the risk factors for a 21-year-old female. She has one prior arrest and is convicted now. That's a solid red flag\u2014past criminal history definitely increases recidivism risk.\n\nShe's White, which might be relevant due to systemic issues or previous disparities in the justice system, but since she's already been convicted once, it's more about her current situation than her race.\n\nHer height and weight aren't factors here. She's living alone, which can complicate things like support networks and access to resources that could help reduce recidivism.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year program. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because it opens up better job opportunities and financial stability.\n\nOnly one job during the year might limit her income potential, but having some education should mitigate that to some extent.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana in the past four years. While cannabis is not as severe as other drugs, even recent use can affect mental health and decision-making abilities, which might influence her behavior again.\n\nNot feeling depressed in the past month suggests she's mentally stable, but prior issues could still play a role.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Shared environments often lead to higher risk of substance abuse or neglect, so that should be considered as contributing to current drug use and stability concerns.\n\nHer religious belief might influence her behavior indirectly, perhaps providing some accountability or support, but it's not directly tied to recidivism factors here.\n\nPutting this all together: The prior arrest is a high factor. Education is low because while she has it, it's ongoing. Drug use and living situation are medium. Everything else seems to balance out towards low risk.\n\nSo the prediction is that she won't reoffend in three years, with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"Her past criminal history significantly increases her likelihood of recidivism as a result of prior convictions which can lead to similar behaviors if not addressed.\" ),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"She has completed associate/junior college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college, which suggests she may have the skills and resources to avoid further criminal behavior.\" ),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Her use of marijuana in the past four years could potentially influence her decision-making and substance abuse behaviors, which may contribute to recidivism.\" ),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases the risk of isolation and substance abuse, which can be precursors to criminal behavior.\" ),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"She lived in a household of size 4 at a young age, which could have provided some level of support but may also contribute to higher risk behaviors if not properly addressed.\" ),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Her religious belief may provide some accountability and support, potentially mitigating the risk of recidivism.\" ),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests she is mentally stable, reducing the likelihood of impulsive or harmful behaviors.\" )\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
