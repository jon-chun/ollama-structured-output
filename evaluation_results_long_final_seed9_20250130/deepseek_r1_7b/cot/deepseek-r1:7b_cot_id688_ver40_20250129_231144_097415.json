    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the risk factors for a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once. Let me start by listing out each factor and assigning them as low, medium, or high based on their impact.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young but she's already been convicted once. Being a first-time offender might mean lower recidivism risk compared to someone with multiple offenses, but since she has one conviction, that could be a medium factor. \n\nHer race is White. I know that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, often leading to higher rearrest rates for Black individuals, so this should probably be a high factor.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct indicator of recidivism risk unless combined with other factors like being overweight or having health issues. So maybe low weight for this assessment.\n\nShe's living alone, which can sometimes correlate with lower stability, but it also depends on the support system she has elsewhere. Since she's never been married and is an only child, maybe her living situation isn't a strong risk factor here\u2014perhaps medium.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is still in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so this should be low.\n\nShe's worked one job during the year. Employment, especially with skills that are in demand, can reduce recidivism. One job might not be enough to predict high risk but it's better than none\u2014maybe medium.\n\nDrug use history: she used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism because it increases impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors. This should be a high factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate she's mentally stable. However, past depression could also be a risk factor if untreated. Since her recent mood isn't associated with depression, maybe medium.\n\nYounger household size at age 4 suggests she had family support in early life, which can reduce recidivism risks. So this is probably low.\n\nLastly, her belief in God might indicate strong moral values, which could contribute to better decision-making and lower risk. This should be a high factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: medium for first offense, high due to race and drug use, medium living situation, medium education, medium employment, medium family support, and high moral values. \n\nPutting it all together, the risk is moderate but leans towards higher because of the significant factors like race and drug use. So I would predict a YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her being a first-time offender may have lower recidivism risk compared to someone with multiple offenses, but one conviction is still significant.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Racial disparities in the criminal justice system can lead to higher rearrest rates for Black individuals, so this should be considered high.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Weight isn't typically a direct indicator of recidivism risk unless combined with other factors like being overweight or having health issues.
