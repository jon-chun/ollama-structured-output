    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment query for a 21-year-old female. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might indicate she's still developing skills and habits. But since she has a conviction already, that's more of an established risk rather than something from her youth.\n\nHer race is White, which isn't directly a risk factor but could be related to systemic issues in the justice system. However, without specific data on racial disparities here, I might not assign it a high weight immediately.\n\nShe's 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs. Weight categories can vary widely by country, so without knowing where she lives or if her BMI is concerning, this factor might be low relevance.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014being single doesn't inherently pose a risk, but there could be underlying issues like substance use or mental health that aren't evident here.\n\nShe has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism because of better job prospects, so this might actually reduce the risk.\n\nOnly one job in the past year\u2014it suggests stability, which is positive but could also mean limited opportunities for rehabilitation or varied experiences that might influence her behavior.\n\nDrug use: Only marijuana in the past four years. If she's using other substances, it's concerning, but since she only mentions marijuana and hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe it's less of an issue now.\n\nShe feels no depression recently, which is a positive sign. People with mental health issues often have higher recidivism rates when not managed, so her current lack might mitigate risk.\n\nYoung household at age 18\u2014size 4. Young households can be chaotic and may have different dynamics that could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nBelieving in God is a positive factor for many, as religious beliefs often correlate with lower recidivism rates due to community support.\n\nPutting it all together: The one job, higher education, lack of depression, and belief in God are strong mitigating factors. The past use of marijuana isn't a big issue since she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe the risk is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21, which may indicate she is still developing skills and habits that could influence her behavior over time.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can sometimes be a consideration in risk assessment, this individual does not have any specific racial factors associated with higher recidivism rates without further context about systemic inequalities in the justice system.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Her height (6 feet 1 inch) and weight (163 lbs) do not directly correlate with recidivism risk without additional context such as body mass index or potential health issues.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk, but her never being married may indicate a lack of support system that could potentially contribute to risky behavior if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"She has completed an associate degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college.
