    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which isn't that old, but she's still relatively young, which might indicate she has more time ahead of her to develop habits or skills that could help avoid recidivism. Her race is White; I know there are some disparities in the criminal justice system related to race, but since she was convicted once and now completes her education, maybe this factor isn't as significant here.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. While weight can sometimes be a risk factor due to health issues, she hasn't mentioned any serious health problems. Her height is more about stature, which might correlate with self-esteem or other factors but probably doesn't directly affect recidivism risk.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can contribute to stress and isolation, which sometimes are linked to substance abuse or other behavioral issues that could lead to recidivism.\n\nHer education level: associate degree and currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is usually considered protective against recidivism because higher education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. However, her current enrollment might indicate she's actively working on improving her situation, which is positive.\n\nShe held only one job during the past year. Having a stable job is associated with lower recidivism rates. If she lost that job or has struggled to find one, it could be a risk factor. But since she was convicted once before and now is studying, maybe this isn't too bad.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to behavioral issues and legal problems, so even if she's not feeling depressed now, past drug use could be a risk factor.\n\nShe's never felt depressed over the past month. A lack of recent depression might indicate better mental health, which is protective against recidivism. But her past drug use could offset that slightly.\n\nHer household size at a young age was four people. Larger households can sometimes correlate with more supervision or fewer resources for stress relief, but this factor alone isn't a strong indicator unless it's associated with neglect.\n\nBelieving in God: This is a positive factor as religious beliefs often provide support and structure, which could aid in personal growth and avoiding recidivism.\n\nPutting all these together, her education seems solid. She's actively studying and working towards betterment. However, she has a past drug use, which can be problematic, but she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a good sign. Her living situation alone might not directly correlate with higher risk if she's managing well. Since she was convicted once before, that's her only prior offense.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the risk of recidivism in 3 years is low because she has strong protective factors like education and current positive mental health indicators. The past drug use isn't a consistent pattern, so it doesn't consistently point towards higher risk. Therefore, assigning low relative weight to each factor except perhaps the drug use, which might be medium.\n\nSo my prediction would lean towards low risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21 years old, indicating she has time ahead for personal development and avoiding recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Although race can have disparities in the criminal justice system, her completion of education and positive current factors suggest low risk.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant health issues reported, so height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to stress but she is managing well with education and employment efforts.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"High level of education (associate degree and currently enrolled in a 2-year college) correlates with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Having held one job during the year, though not stable, suggests some effort to improve but no direct link to high risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use without recent depression indicates potential behavioral issues that could be a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"No recent feelings of depression suggest good mental health, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Larger household may have had more supervision or resources for stress relief but no direct link to risk here.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Positive influence on personal growth and avoiding recidivism through support and structure.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
