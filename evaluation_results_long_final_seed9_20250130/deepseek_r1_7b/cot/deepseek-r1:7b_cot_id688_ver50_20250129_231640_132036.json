    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That seems significant because younger individuals might have different motivations or circumstances that could affect their likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe identifies as White, which isn't directly a risk factor, but it's worth noting in case there are any systemic issues related to race and recidivism, though I don't think that's relevant here. Her height is 6'1\" and she weighs 163 lbs. That information might be useful for assessing if she's sedentary or if she has a history of substance abuse, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe that's not a factor.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems around her, which might help in preventing recidivism by having someone to turn to if things go wrong. But I'm not sure how strong that effect is compared to other factors.\n\nHer educational background: associate or junior college completion plus current enrollment at a 2-year college. Higher education can sometimes correlate with better job opportunities and financial stability, which might reduce the risk of reoffending. So maybe this factor has a medium impact because while education can help, it's possible she could still struggle if other factors are present.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some work experience is generally positive for reducing recidivism, but since she only had one job and now is in college, perhaps her income stability isn't as strong. Maybe this factor has a low to medium impact depending on how consistent her employment was or if she's planning better financial stability.\n\nDrug use history: she used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can increase risk of reoffending, especially if it leads to other substance abuse issues or impulsive behavior. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed recently might not negate this risk because drug use often has negative consequences beyond just emotional states.\n\nHer belief in God is present, which could relate to personal support systems or spirituality influencing her behavior and decision-making. However, without more information on how strongly this belief affects her actions, it's hard to gauge the impact of this factor.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households sometimes provide more emotional stability but can also contribute to substance abuse if there are underlying issues within the family that aren't addressed. This might influence her current behavior patterns indirectly.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of a prior arrest and conviction, combined with a history of drug use (marijuana), could significantly increase her risk of reoffending. Her living situation alone doesn't seem to directly contribute to increased risk but maybe the lack of strong support systems from family or a partner due to being single could be a factor. Her education is positive but might not fully offset other negative factors.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think her risk of rearrest within three years is high because of the significant criminal history and drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests/Criminals\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which can indicate past behavior patterns that may influence future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use can lead to increased risk of substance abuse and impulsive behaviors, contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems which could potentially increase risk if there are unaddressed family issues or substance abuse triggers.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
