    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 21-year-old woman will be rearrested within three years. She's white, female, 6'1\", weighs 163 lbs, never married, living alone. Education-wise, she has an associate's degree and is currently in college. Job-wise, she worked one job last year. Drug use: marijuana past four years, but no depression in the past month.\n\nLooking at her background, she was arrested once and convicted. She lived with four people when young, which might suggest some level of family support or maybe instability? Her religious beliefs could play a role in her behavior, perhaps providing guidance or structure that affects her decisions now.\n\nShe's relatively young (21), so maybe more likely to change her circumstances soon. The fact she completed associate's and is in college suggests she's proactive about her education, which might help prevent recidivism.\n\nThe job aspect: one job for a year isn't a lot of experience, but it shows some commitment. Not using drugs recently could be a positive sign, though past use should still be considered.\n\nHer living situation alone and not married could mean higher independence, maybe less dependency on others which could contribute to making impulsive decisions if something triggers her.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the weight is probably low because of education, job experience, and relatively recent non-use of drugs. The only negative points are past arrest and drug use in the past. Since she's young, the positive factors might outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Age (21 years old):**\n   - Aged 21 suggests potential for future growth and changed life circumstances which could reduce recidivism risk.\n\n2. **Education Level:**\n   - Completed associate's degree and currently enrolled in college, indicating higher education and proactive learning, which can aid in reducing recidivism.\n\n3. **Employment History:**\n   - Employed one job last year; a recent work experience may demonstrate stability and responsibility towards financial obligations.\n\n4. **Drug Use:**\n   - marijuana use past four years but no recent depression (past month). Past drug use could indicate potential triggers or relapse risks, though not directly linked to recidivism in this case.\n\n5. **Living Situation:**\n   - Lives alone; living with family can provide emotional support and reduce impulsive decisions due to lower dependency on others.\n\n6. **Past Arrest and Conviction:**\n   - Single arrest history; recidivism is influenced by past criminal behavior, but one-time arrest in this context may be less significant than other factors.\n\n7. **Religious Beliefs:**\n   - Believes in God's influence on her life; religious support can contribute to a structured lifestyle and ethical decision-making, reducing recidivism risk.\n\n**Overall Risk Factors:**\n\n- **Past Drug Use:** Medium weight (past use may indicate potential for triggers)\n- **Past Arrest:** Low weight (single arrest history with recent completion of education)\n\n**Final Prediction:**\nBased on the analysis, the overall risk is considered **low** due to positive factors like education, employment, and living alone. While past drug use exists, other significant factors mitigate the risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past drug use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use in the past four years could potentially indicate a trigger or relapse risk but is mitigated by recent positive behavior without depression in the past month.\"),\n    (\"single arrest conviction\", \"low\", \"A single prior arrest and conviction may slightly increase risk, but combined with other favorable factors like education and employment history, it is outweighed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
