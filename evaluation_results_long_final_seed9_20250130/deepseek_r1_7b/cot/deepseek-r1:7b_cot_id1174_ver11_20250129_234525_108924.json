    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male reoffending within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That seems pretty significant. Reincarceration is a big risk here because it shows trust issues and past mistakes.\n\nHe's Black, which historically has had some systemic issues in the justice system that might affect his treatment or access to resources, but I'm not sure how much that impacts recidivism specifically without more context.\n\nHis height and weight aren't factors I usually consider for recidivism. Maybe they relate to other risks like substance use? Not really here since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years.\n\nLiving alone is a bit concerning because living with someone can provide support, which might reduce future criminal behavior. But it's also possible that isolation could lead to deeper issues contributing to his current situation.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests he has little formal education, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates. Plus, lack of education can sometimes be a motivator for criminal behavior.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Employment stability is another factor; having a steady job can provide stability and reduce stress, but maybe this young guy was in a tough spot when he lost his job.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs recently, which is positive, so that's a good sign against reoffending in that area.\n\nHis feelings of low mood for much of the month might indicate underlying mental health issues. Mental health problems can definitely increase the risk of recidivism because they often contribute to impulsive or self-harming behaviors.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at an early age, which doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless there were family dysfunction issues he didn't mention.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might affect his motivation towards good behavior. Without religious support, he might not have the same framework for making good choices or dealing with stress.\n\nPutting it all together: four arrests and convictions are high risk factors. No HS diploma is medium to high. His mood suggests possible mental health issues which could be high. The job situation isn't great but maybe doesn't add much here. So his overall risk is pretty high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and two convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior, which significantly increases the likelihood of future reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED suggests limited educational opportunities and potential for lack of skills that could contribute to criminal behavior.
