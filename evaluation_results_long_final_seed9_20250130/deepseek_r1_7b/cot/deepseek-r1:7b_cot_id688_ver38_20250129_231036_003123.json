    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. That's relatively young, but she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. Young adults can sometimes be more likely to reoffend as they gain experience later in life.\n\nShe identifies as White, which isn't directly a risk factor, but it might influence things like systemic issues or access to certain resources, though that's speculative without more info.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and weight 163 lbs. This doesn't immediately indicate a risk factor related to recidivism; body type usually isn't a direct indicator unless there are health concerns, which we don't have here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can sometimes be linked to stress or isolation, but without knowing her circumstances, it's hard to say how much that affects recidivism.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education is generally associated with lower recidivism because of better job opportunities and life skills, so this might actually lower the risk.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Employment history can be positive if stable, but one job isn't enough to predict future stability or rearrest.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism because it increases vulnerability to resumed drug use and associated criminal activities. This seems significant.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but she might have had issues before. Depression can contribute to substance abuse or criminal behavior, so that's something to consider, though not directly a risk factor here.\n\nHousehold size at young age was four people. Larger households in early life can sometimes lead to different family dynamics, but again, without knowing current circumstances, it's hard to assess the impact on recidivism.\n\nHer belief in God might relate to personal motivation or support, which isn't necessarily a risk factor but could influence behavior indirectly.\n\nPutting this all together: Drug use (high risk) seems like the most significant factor here. Her past drug use is a strong indicator of potential relapse. The rest don't add much positive factors that would offset that risk. So her overall risk for rearrest is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Her having one prior conviction and being young (21) may increase the likelihood of reoffending as she gains life experience later in life.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which is a known risk factor for recidivism as it increases vulnerability to resumed drug use and associated criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"She held one job during the year, which may indicate some stability, but this alone does not guarantee no future employment challenges or reoffending issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Contraindications\", \"medium\", \"She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month.
