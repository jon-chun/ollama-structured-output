    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female who's been arrested once. She has a few factors that might influence her recidivism over the next three years.\n\nFirst, her history of substance use\u2014she used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a known risk factor because it can impair judgment and decision-making, making her more likely to engage in risky behaviors again. So that's probably a high weight.\n\nShe also hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While not feeling down might seem positive, chronic depression isn't something she's experienced yet. Her recent mood could be a reflection of her current state rather than a long-term issue affecting her risk.\n\nHer low educational attainment\u2014only associate or junior college and currently attending another college\u2014isn't directly bad, but maybe limited education could mean she has fewer resources to avoid criminal activities. However, it might not be as significant compared to other factors.\n\nShe's living alone, which can increase stress and vulnerability. Living with others usually provides support that reduces risk. But it's a contributing factor along with other issues.\n\nHer job experience\u2014only one job in the past year\u2014suggests she might have struggled to find stable employment. Unemployment or underemployment is often linked to higher recidivism rates as it can lead to dependency on welfare or other negative outcomes.\n\nShe was raised in a household of four, which could mean more stressors and less family support compared to smaller households. This environment might contribute to behavioral issues that could reoccur.\n\nHer religious belief is noted, but I'm not sure how that affects her risk. It's possible it provides some guidance or stability, which might mitigate risk factors if she uses it constructively.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some mitigating factors like education and living alone, the main risk comes from substance use, unemployment, limited job experience, and past household size. These points push her into a medium to high risk category for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past marijuana use\", \"medium\", \"Substance abuse history can increase the likelihood of future drug-related offenses and impaired judgment.\"),\n    (\"no recent depression\", \"low\", \"Lack of recent depression may indicate resilience, but it doesn't necessarily negate prior issues or stress factors in her past household size of four at a young age which could contribute to behavioral instability.\"),\n    (\"limited education\", \"low\", \"While limited educational attainment can sometimes be linked to recidivism due to lack of skills and resources, this factor alone may not significantly increase risk compared to other contributing factors like substance use and employment status.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress and vulnerability, which might contribute to increased risk behaviors or reengaging in criminal activities if not supported by a network.\"),\n    (\"one job in past year\", \"low\", \"One job may provide stability, but it could also indicate challenges in finding more stable or productive employment, which might affect her ability to avoid or deter criminal behavior over time.\"),\n    (\"household size of 4 at young age\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of four can lead to increased stress and less family support, potentially contributing to behavioral issues that may reoccur as she navigates independence and new environments.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
