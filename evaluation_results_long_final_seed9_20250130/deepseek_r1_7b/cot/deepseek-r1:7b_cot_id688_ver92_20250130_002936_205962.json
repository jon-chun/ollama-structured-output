    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might be considered a younger adult, but she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. Younger offenders can sometimes have different behaviors compared to older ones, so that's something to note, but not sure if it directly affects the risk.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I don't know how that plays into recidivism rates\u2014though generally, statistics show certain disparities, but without more info, maybe it's neutral here.\n\nShe is 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs. Not sure how height or weight contribute to risk assessment; usually, it's more about other factors like substance use or prior convictions.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being single might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor because she relies on herself more, making her situation potentially riskier.\n\nShe has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability, so this might actually lower the risk of rearrest compared to someone with fewer resources or stable employment.\n\nShe held one job recently. Employment, especially a stable one, usually reduces recidivism because it provides motivation and purpose, along with support systems like health insurance or benefits.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism, as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior. However, if she's abstaining now, that might indicate better self-discipline, which could mitigate the risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. While not directly related to drug use, chronic mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior. Since she's not depressed now, it's a positive sign.\n\nYoung household at age: She lived with three others when young. Young households might be more chaotic or have higher turnover rates, which could affect her stability and support network as an adult.\n\nBelieves in God's influence on her life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose but might also lead to risky behaviors if not aligned with healthy coping mechanisms. However, this is more about personal motivation than direct risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors that would increase risk are drug use (past four years), living alone without social support, and young household experiences. However, her education, stable job, and current lack of depression could lower the risk. Without more info on how these factors interact, but given she has a prior conviction and some negative aspects like drug use in the past, I'm leaning towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her being 21 years old may be considered younger, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to different behavioral patterns compared to older adults.
