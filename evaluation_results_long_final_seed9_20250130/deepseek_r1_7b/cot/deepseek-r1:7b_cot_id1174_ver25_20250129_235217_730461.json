    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times. He has a high recidivism probability over three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's got a history of four arrests and convictions. That's pretty significant on its own\u2014it shows a pattern of criminal behavior which can increase the risk of reoffending. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I don't know if his weight is relevant here unless there are issues with substance abuse, but he hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Maybe his BMI isn't an issue, so maybe this factor doesn't add much to the risk.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, and without a high school diploma or GED. His education level can sometimes be linked to recidivism\u2014if someone didn't complete school, they might have less stability or fewer opportunities for positive development. So that could be another high factor.\n\nOnly holding one job in the past year\u2014jobless time might mean he's not actively seeking employment or has struggled with skills necessary for reintegration into society successfully. That could be a medium risk factor because it depends on his circumstances and support system, which we don't have information on.\n\nHe felt down during the past month but hasn't used drugs. Maybe some stress issues? But without more info on mental health services access or support, this might not add much to the risk factors beyond what's already noted.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four\u2014I wonder if family dynamics could influence his behavior. Sometimes larger families can lead to different social pressures, but again, without specific information about how that affected him, it's hard to gauge as a high factor.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his life might suggest a lack of religious support or spirituality, which some studies show are associated with lower recidivism rates. So this could be a low risk factor because less spiritual individuals might have different motivators for positive behavior change.\n\nPutting it all together: four arrests and convictions (high), education without a diploma (high), living alone (medium), jobless but no recent drug use (maybe medium), family of four (low), and lack of religious involvement (low). So the strongest factors are the criminal history and education. The prediction would lean towards high risk, so I'd say YES with confidence around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and convictions, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior that can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education (no high school diploma or GED) can contribute to instability and increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"job experience\", \"medium\", \"Only held one job in the past year, which may indicate limited opportunities for positive development or reintegration into society.\"),\n    (\"family dynamics\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of four; larger families sometimes present different social pressures but without specific information on impact, it's considered low risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believes God has no role in his life, which may suggest less religious support and potentially lower recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
