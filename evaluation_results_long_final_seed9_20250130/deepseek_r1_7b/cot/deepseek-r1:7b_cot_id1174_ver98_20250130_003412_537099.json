    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for an 18-year-old male. I'll go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he has been arrested four times with convictions. That's a solid indicator of past behavior issues, so high risk there.\n\nNext, age and living situation. Being 18 might mean he's still developing, which can be a risk factor. Living alone without supervision could lead to self-harm or substance abuse, so that adds to the risk factors related to self-harm and substance use.\n\nEducation level: He lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lower education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because he might not have the skills needed for success or might turn to drugs for support.\n\nEmployment: He only held one job recently, which is concerning. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substances or further criminal behavior as a means of stress relief.\n\nDrug use: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but he felt low recently. This could be a sign of substance abuse issues, even if he's clean now. It might indicate ongoing struggles that could resurface.\n\nMental health: His recent feelings of depression are significant. Substance use can worsen mental health, and without professional help, he might not address these issues, leading to more problems.\n\nPast living situation: At a young age in a household of four, he might have had unstable family support, which can contribute to behavioral issues like drug use or self-harm.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe in God. This lack of faith could affect his decision-making and relationships, potentially increasing risk factors related to self-harm or substance abuse.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor points towards a high risk. The combination makes me highly confident this individual is likely to rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with multiple arrests and convictions, which indicates past behavior issues that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age and living situation\", \"medium\", \"At 18 years old, the individual may be in a developmental stage where external factors like lack of supervision or support can contribute to self-harm or substance abuse.
