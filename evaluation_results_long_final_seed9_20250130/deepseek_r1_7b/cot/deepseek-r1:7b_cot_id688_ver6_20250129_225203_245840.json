    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old female. Let me break down her background and see how each factor might influence her chances of being rearrested.\n\nFirst, she's White, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some systemic bias, which isn't indicated. She has one prior arrest and a conviction, so that's a red flag because recidivism is about reoffending.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Weight for age doesn't seem concerning, but maybe her education level could relate to how stable she might be. She has an associate degree and is in college, which often leads to better job opportunities, so that's a positive factor, lowering the risk.\n\nShe's living alone, which can mean less support network, possibly leading to higher recidivism because she might not have help when things go wrong. Not being married could also affect her stability since financial and emotional support from a spouse is often present.\n\nShe holds only one job during the year. That might be enough for stability, but if it's a low-paying or unstable job, that could increase risk. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive as depression can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHer drug use history: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct cause of arrest, but it might indicate she's using substances that could affect her judgment or behavior.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age, which might suggest she was raised in an environment with more stressors or less supervision, potentially affecting her current stability and decision-making.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her personal life is positive because spirituality can sometimes offer coping mechanisms and guidance against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are high risk. Living alone might increase risk but education level could mitigate it. Job situation is okay, but not a strong indicator. Drug use isn't directly linked but could influence other factors indirectly. Young household environment might have some negatives but also some positives from her religious belief and education.\n\nI think the overall risk is medium because while there are mitigating factors like education and religion, there's still a significant chance she might reoffend, especially considering her prior conviction and living situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Her one prior arrest and conviction significantly increase the risk of reoffending as recidivism is about reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can reduce support network, potentially increasing risk but her education level could mitigate this factor.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"She holds a job which may provide stability, though the nature of the job might affect its impact on recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past doesn't directly cause arrest but could influence other behavioral factors indirectly.\"),\n    (\"Young Household Environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of four at a young age may have had both negative and positive influences, contributing to potential instability or providing coping mechanisms.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Her belief that God has something to do with her personal life can offer guidance and reduce criminal tendencies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
