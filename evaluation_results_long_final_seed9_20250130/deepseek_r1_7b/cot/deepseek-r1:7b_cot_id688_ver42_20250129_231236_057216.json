    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a risk assessment task for a 21-year-old female. Let me break down the factors provided.\n\nFirst, she's White but hasn't indicated any specific issues related to her race that would affect recidivism. So, no high-risk factor there.\n\nHer criminal history: one arrest and one conviction. That's moderate; it does carry some weight but isn't overwhelming.\n\nAge-wise, being 21 might not be a big risk if she's in college, which she is. Education at the associate level plus ongoing college suggests strong academic motivation, which could lead to better job prospects and stability.\n\nShe's single and living alone. While living with family can reduce stress, living alone doesn't inherently increase risk unless there are other factors like social isolation, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Recurrent drug use can impede employment and contribute to unstable living situations, which might increase recidivism risk.\n\nMarital status: single and no kids, so no immediate family issues affecting her stability.\n\nEmployment: one job during the year. While unemployment is a concern, having some work experience is positive, especially if it's related to her field of study.\n\nReligious affiliation: she believes in God. That might influence her behavior towards good conduct or positivity, which could be a mitigating factor.\n\nLiving situation since young age with four people; that was stable, so no evidence of living conditions issues elsewhere.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors don't strongly indicate high risk but have enough moderate elements to suggest she's on the lower end of recidivism. My prediction leans towards low to medium risk.\n</think>\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1. **Criminal History:** One arrest and one conviction carry moderate weight as they indicate past behavior that could influence future actions.\n\n2. **Education Level:** Currently pursuing a 2-year college degree suggests dedication and potential for better job prospects, mitigating risk.\n\n3. **Employment:** Employed part-time indicates stability but may lack depth, which could be a concern if not related to her field of study.\n\n4. **Drug Use:** Past marijuana use is noted; drug abuse can impede employment and contribute to instability, increasing risk factors.\n\n5. **Living Alone:** No immediate family support mentioned, but living conditions aren't inherently risky without additional info on personal issues.\n\n6. **Past Household Size:** Small household may suggest stability at that time, reducing risk indicators.\n\n7. **Religious Affiliation:** Believes in God; this could imply a focus on moral behavior, acting as a mitigating factor.\n\n**Risk Factors Weight:**\n\n- **Low to Medium Risk:** The factors lean towards moderate risk due to past criminal history and drug use.\n  \n  ```json\n  {\n    \"risk_factors\": [\n      (\"Criminal History\", \"low\", \"One arrest and one conviction indicate past behavior that could influence future actions.\"),\n      (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Currently pursuing a 2-year college degree suggests dedication but may lack depth if not related to her field of study.\"),\n      (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Employed part-time indicates stability, but it's unclear how relevant this is to her field of study or job security.\"),\n      (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use can impede employment and contribute to instability which could increase risk factors.\"),\n      (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone isn't inherently risky without additional info on personal issues or living conditions.\")\n    ],\n    \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n    \"confidence\": 60\n  }\n  ```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has completed study at an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 1 job during the year.
