    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female with various factors contributing to her likelihood of rearrest. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's white. I don't know if race is a significant factor here beyond any societal biases. Maybe it has minimal impact on recidivism rates, so perhaps low weight.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That seems like a clear indicator of past behavior; maybe medium risk because having a prior offense could influence her current behavior.\n\nHer height and weight don't directly relate to recidivism, so I'll assign them low weights.\n\nLiving alone might mean she's less likely to have support, which could increase risk, but at the same time, maybe she has strong personal drive. Still, perhaps medium weight because it's a moderate factor.\n\nShe\u2019s never married and living alone again\u2014similar reasoning as above; maybe a bit higher risk if she's more independent now, so medium or low?\n\nHer education is associate/junior college and currently in 2-year college. College attendance could indicate better job opportunities and self-discipline, which might lower the risk, so perhaps low.\n\nShe held one job recently\u2014maybe some stability but not much experience yet. So maybe low weight because she's new to work.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Recidivistic drug use can have significant impacts on recidivism rates, so medium or high? Since it's non-marijuana and recent, perhaps medium.\n\nMental health: no feelings of depression over the past month. That might be a positive sign as consistent mental health could correlate with lower risk factors. So low weight.\n\nYouth living in a household of four\u2014could indicate some instability or family issues which might have carried over into adulthood, so maybe moderate to high risk? I'll lean towards medium because it's not extreme but still concerning.\n\nShe believes in God. That\u2019s a positive factor related to spirituality and personal accountability, possibly lowering the risk. So low weight.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest (medium), education (low), living alone (moderate), job held recently (low), drug use (medium). The rest are either neutral or lower. So overall, it's probably medium risk.\n</think>\n\nBased on a comprehensive evaluation of each factor contributing to recidivism:\n\n- **Prior Arrest and Conviction**: Medium risk due to past behavior influencing current actions.\n- **Education Level**: Low risk as education often correlates with better job opportunities and self-discipline.\n- **Living Alone**: Medium risk as independence can sometimes signal potential challenges in maintaining stability.\n- **Drug Use**: Medium risk indicating occasional substance use that may impact future behavior.\n- **Mental Health**: Low risk due to the absence of recent mental health issues, suggesting positive personal health.\n- **Youth Household Size**: Medium risk reflecting potential family dynamics that might have carried over into adulthood.\n\n**Final Prediction**: The collective assessment places her within a medium risk category for rearrest recidivism. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Has one prior arrest and conviction which suggests past behavior that may influence current actions.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Education level of associate/junior college and currently in a 2-year college indicates potential job opportunities and self-discipline.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"moderate\", \"Living alone could indicate less support, but might also suggest personal drive or independence which can be both positive and negative factors.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Held one job during the year which may indicate some stability but not much experience yet.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in past four years (marijuana) could have significant impacts on recidivism rates.
