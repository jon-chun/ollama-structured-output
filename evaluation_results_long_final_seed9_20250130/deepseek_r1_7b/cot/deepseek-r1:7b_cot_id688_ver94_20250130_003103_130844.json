    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she's making her own choices now. She has a White identifier, but race can influence recidivism based on systemic issues and biases in the justice system.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction. That's not great, but it's manageable. One-time offense history might have some impact depending on what she did, which I don't know yet.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and weight 163 lbs \u2013 that's average for her age group, so no immediate issues there.\n\nLiving alone without a partner means she's responsible but maybe less likely to get support if things go south. No kids either, so family dynamics aren't a factor here.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education can be protective against recidivism as it provides more life skills and stability.\n\nShe held only one job last year. Unemployment for that long might signal instability or lack of skills, which could increase risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use alone isn't a big issue unless it's linked to other negative behaviors like substance abuse disorders.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression suggests she's mentally stable, which is positive for recidivism chances.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four at young age could mean a lot of siblings and maybe a chaotic environment, which might have long-term effects on her behavior or family relationships.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her life \u2013 some people find comfort in religion but others associate it with discipline. I'm not sure how this affects her risk without more context.\n\nPutting this together: The factors like past offense, unemployment, and living situation might suggest she could be at medium risk. The positive aspects of education and mental stability might temper that a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21, which may indicate early decision-making but does not directly correlate with recidivism risk without knowing the nature of her offense.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Racial identifier could influence systemic factors affecting recidivism risk based on historical and current biases in the justice system.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"One arrest and one conviction may suggest past involvement, which can be a significant factor in recidivism predictions depending on the nature of the offense.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight for her age group do not typically indicate issues related to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a partner may reduce immediate support but does not inherently increase risk without additional factors like substance abuse or unemployment.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Higher education with an associate degree and current college enrollment may provide stability and protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Only one job held last year may indicate potential instability, which can be a risk factor for recidivism if it leads to repeated situations where she might engage in illegal activities or face new challenges.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years with no recent feelings of depression does not strongly suggest substance abuse issues that could lead to recidivism, but it should be considered within broader context.\"),\n    (\"Mental Stability\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression suggests she is mentally stable, which can be protective against recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of four may have had a significant impact on her behavior or family dynamics that could potentially influence her recidivism risk over time but does not directly correlate with current risk factors without additional context\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God for comfort or discipline may provide some protective factors against substance abuse and recidivism, depending on her personal experiences and practices.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
