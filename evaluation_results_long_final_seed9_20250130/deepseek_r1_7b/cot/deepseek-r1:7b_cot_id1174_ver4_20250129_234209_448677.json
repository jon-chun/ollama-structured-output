    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times with convictions. That's a pretty high number of prior convictions, which definitely increases the risk. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 145 lbs. I don't know if that affects recidivism directly, but maybe relates to other factors like physical activity or health issues. Not sure yet.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, no children. Being an only child could mean less supervision, which might contribute to higher risk.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is often linked with lower recidivism rates because it can lead to better job opportunities and stable lives.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Only one job at 18 seems possible but maybe not enough stability for long-term success, which could increase risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, so that's positive. But he did feel down sometimes. Could that affect his mental health? If he's struggling with mood issues, it might impact his ability to reintegrate into society or manage substance abuse.\n\nHe lived in a household of four when young. More siblings could mean more supervision but also possibly more family issues if there were conflicts.\n\nHis belief in God might influence his motivation towards positive behavior, but if he feels disconnected from higher power and doesn't seek support, it might not help much.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are high (4), education is low, living alone increases risk factors. The job is minimal, no drugs but mood issues could be problematic. The family background when young isn't great either. So overall, I think his risk of rearrest is pretty high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested four times with convictions significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce supervision, potentially increasing vulnerability to negative influences or stress.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Only one job held during the year might indicate limited stability or economic dependence on that single source of income.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor, but occasional mood swings could indicate underlying mental health issues that may affect behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with siblings in a household of four when young might imply family dysfunction or lack of adult supervision which can contribute to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Mood and Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Feeling down occasionally is common, but without support systems, this could lead to substance abuse or other destabilizing factors.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"While belief in a higher power may provide motivation, the individual's disconnection from it suggests limited spiritual guidance which might not offer strong support for positive behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
