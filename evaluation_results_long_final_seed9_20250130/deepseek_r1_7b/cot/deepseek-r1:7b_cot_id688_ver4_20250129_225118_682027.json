    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That seems significant because past convictions are a clear indicator of past behavior that could lead to future issues. So I'd assign her high risk from this factor.\n\nHer age is 21, which isn't too old yet, but it's early in her life, so maybe she's still developing her skills and habits. But considering she has a criminal history, the timing might not matter as much.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there's some racial disparity in the criminal justice system, where certain communities are overrepresented in arrests and convictions. So being White could increase her risk relative to others from similar situations but different backgrounds.\n\nHeight is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. Her BMI isn't extremely high, so she might be of average weight for her height. No information on obesity or other health issues that could contribute to recidivism, so maybe this factor doesn't add much risk here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors because there are no social support systems to deter bad choices. But I'm not sure how significant this is compared to her criminal history.\n\nShe has a associates or junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year program. Education is generally linked to lower recidivism rates, so having some education might reduce the risk here. However, if she's not completing her education, that could be concerning. But since she's enrolled, maybe it's less of an issue.\n\nShe held one job during the past year. Employment can provide stability and reduce recidivism because income can help with financial obligations and reduce stress. One job isn't a lot, but it's still positive compared to not working at all.\n\nDrug use history: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Marijuana use is generally less harmful than other drugs like cocaine or heroin, but even occasional use can have negative effects that might contribute to recidivism indirectly. However, since she hasn't felt depressed lately, maybe this factor isn't as concerning.\n\nShe's considered to live in a household of four at a young age and believes God plays a role in her life. The size of the household could influence her stability; living with more people might mean less supervision or more shared responsibility for substance use. Her religious belief is positive but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it's affecting her behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, her high criminal history and factors like living alone and drug use (albeit minor) seem to be the main concerns. The other factors don't add as much risk. So I'd lean towards a high relative weight for each of these significant factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Her one arrest and conviction indicate past behavior that could lead to future issues.\"),\n    (\"Age and Developmental Stage\", \"medium\", \"At 21, she is still developing her skills and habits, though prior criminal history may affect current risk.\"),\n    (\"Racial Background\", \"high\", \"Cultural background may influence risk behaviors due to systemic inequalities in the justice system.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can correlate with higher risk behaviors without social support systems.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having completed some education, though currently enrolled, suggests potential for better outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
