    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. He's been arrested four times with convictions, which is a big red flag. Age-wise, 18 might mean he's still developing socially or maybe has had some challenges that led him down this path.\n\nHis race is Black, but I'm not sure if that plays into it directly here unless there's some systemic factors involved in the justice system, but since we're focusing on his personal factors, maybe it doesn't matter as much. He's living alone, which could mean he's less supported and might face more isolation issues.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED, so maybe he didn't finish school properly, which can sometimes lead to employment issues down the line that contribute to recidivism.\n\nNot being married and living alone probably means he doesn't have a strong support network. Maybe he's going through some personal struggles or stressors that are affecting his ability to reintegrate into society positively.\n\nHe's only held one job, so limited work experience might mean he doesn't have the necessary skills for current or future jobs, which could hinder his ability to avoid being in trouble again.\n\nNot using drugs for four years is positive, but if he felt really down and couldn't find joy in anything else, that might indicate deeper issues like lack of purpose or engagement with life. That's a red flag because it suggests he might not have the motivation to change his situation.\n\nHe had a household size of 4 when young, which could imply family instability or a lot of responsibility on him as an adult. Maybe he feels overwhelmed and doesn't know how to handle things on his own.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might mean he's more likely to seek help from other areas like religion for emotional support. Since he's not getting that, he might turn to other negative outlets or have lower self-esteem, which could affect his behavior.\n\nPutting all this together, the factors pointing towards high risk are clear: multiple arrests, low education, living alone, limited work experience, drug-free but possibly lack of purpose, family background, and belief in other support systems. All these contribute to a higher chance of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests with convictions, which is a significant indicator of past problematic behavior that may recur.\"),\n    (\"No Educational Background\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED despite being an adult may limit future opportunities and contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which may affect social support networks and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Limited Work Experience\", \"medium\", \"Having only held one job for a year suggests limited exposure to various work environments and skills that could aid in reintegrating positively into society.\"),\n    (\"Drug-Free but Possible Stress or Lack of Purpose\", \"medium\", \"Not using drugs for four years combined with feelings of loneliness may indicate underlying issues contributing to potential risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Small Household Size at a Young Age\", \"high\", \"Family dynamics from a young age could have left the individual with limited support structures, potentially leading to increased risk factors in adulthood.\"),\n    (\"No Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"A lack of religious belief may lead to seeking other forms of emotional support or spirituality, which can sometimes result in self-harm or risky behaviors.\")),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
