    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query where the user is asking me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They want me to assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each of the provided risk factors and then predict rearrest recidivism over three years with a prediction and confidence level.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information given about this 21-year-old female:\n\n- She's White.\n- Arrested once, convicted.\n- Height: 6'1\", weight: 163 lbs. That doesn't seem to be a risk factor on its own; maybe BMI could matter but it's not provided here.\n- Never married, living alone. Living situation can impact support systems and stability, so that might be a medium or high risk factor.\n- Educational background: Associate/Junior College completed, currently in college for two years. College attendance is generally positive, but continuing education might reduce recidivism.\n- One job held during the year. Employment usually reduces recidivism because of the financial and social stability it provides.\n- Drug use: Marijuana in past four years, no recent depression. Drug use can be a risk factor if it's frequent or severe, but she only used marijuana once mentioned. Depression isn't linked to reoffending here as she hasn't felt it recently.\n- Young age of first offense at 21. Offense at a younger age might indicate more impulsivity or higher recidivism risk.\n- Household size was four when young. Smaller household can sometimes mean less supervision, but this is a bit unclear how it affects her now.\n\nNow, considering each factor:\n\n1. **Age of first offense**: 21 is relatively young, which could increase the risk. Maybe medium.\n2. **Drug use (marijuana)**: Past use might indicate potential relapse, so low to medium.\n3. **Living alone**: Living alone can be isolating and may affect mental health or support systems. Medium risk.\n4. **Employment**: One job seems stable; less likely to reoffend. Low.\n5. **Household size at young age**: Four people might mean more supervision, so maybe lower risk than average but not low.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors that increase risk are the young age of first offense, past drug use, and living alone. These seem moderate enough to suggest a slightly higher risk without being extremely high. Employment is positive, which would temper some of that risk. So overall, maybe medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age of first offense at 21\", \"medium\", \"The individual's young age may indicate more impulsivity or higher recidivism risk compared to older offenders.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana) in past four years\", \"low\", \"While she has used marijuana, it is not mentioned as being frequent or severe, which may reduce the risk of substance abuse-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone since young age\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and potential mental health issues, increasing the risk slightly compared to individuals with family support.\"),\n    (\"Employment during the past year (1 job)\", \"low\", \"Having a job provides stability and may reduce the likelihood of reoffending compared to unemployed individuals.\"),\n    (\"Household size at young age (4 people)\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of four might provide some level of supervision or support, which could slightly reduce the risk compared to households with fewer members.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
