    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down her information step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That alone can be a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that might point to high risk.\n\nShe's white, but I don't think race is a factor here unless there are systemic issues, which aren't mentioned. So maybe no direct impact on her risk.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism. She's living alone, which could mean she has fewer support networks that might help her stay out of trouble.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is currently single, so again, no direct link but might indicate independence, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is still in college. College completion usually correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism, so maybe that's a low risk factor here.\n\nShe held only one job during the year, which could be a sign of instability, but if she's attending college, it might indicate she's looking to improve her situation. So maybe medium risk because joblessness can sometimes lead to more involvement in the system.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana is often a gateway drug, so that could be a high risk factor as it might increase her willingness to try harder drugs or engage in criminal activities.\n\nHer belief in God shows a strong moral compass, which might reduce recidivism risk because she's more likely to stay within the system ethically. So that could be low risk.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest (high), marijuana use (high), lack of support network (medium), joblessness (medium). The other factors seem to balance out, so maybe the overall risk is medium but leans towards high because of the arrest and drug use.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully evaluating each factor related to the individual's history, current circumstances, and potential influences on recidivism, here is the analysis:\n\n- **Prior Arrests**: High. A single prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n- **Drug Use (Marijuana)**: High. Drug use, particularly marijuana, can be a precursor to more serious drug use or criminal behavior.\n- **Joblessness**: Medium. Holding only one job might indicate instability but could also suggest a desire for improvement through education.\n- **Religious Belief**: Low. A strong moral compass may contribute to staying within the system and reducing risk.\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall prediction leans towards high risk due to prior convictions and drug use, despite mitigating influences like religious belief. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"A single prior arrest increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use is often a gateway to harder drug use or criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"joblessness\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job may indicate job instability but could also suggest a desire for improvement through education.\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"A strong moral compass may reduce recidivism risk by encouraging ethical behavior within the system.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
