Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and convictions. That's definitely a strong indicator of past behavior that could lead to more issues, so high risk there.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches, which is within the average range for his age. No indication here of physical health issues, so maybe no direct impact on recidivism\u2014low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes be a protective factor if he has support, but since he's an adult and doesn't have family around him, it might not help much\u2014medium or low. Maybe medium because it's more about living situation than personal factors here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED shows he didn't complete basic education, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates if he wasn't given the chance to improve his skills\u2014high risk factor.\n\nHe's only held one job in a year. Job instability often correlates with higher recidivism because it may reflect past issues with the legal system or personal problems that affect employment\u2014medium high risk.\n\nNo drug use for four years is positive and can indicate better mental health, which might lower his chances of reoffending\u2014low risk factor.\n\nHe felt down recently but managed to stay sober. This suggests he's in a good mental state, so low risk here.\n\nAt 18 living with four people is typical; nothing jumps out as problematic unless there were family issues not mentioned here\u2014maybe low or medium. Since no other factors are indicated, probably low.\n\nNo religious affiliation doesn't necessarily mean anything positive, but it might suggest he's more independent, which could be a protective factor\u2014low risk.\n\nPutting all together: four arrests (high), lack of education (high), joblessness (medium high), living alone (low impact?), no drugs (low). The rest seem low or medium. So overall, the risk is pretty high because of the arrest and education factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"High risk due to four arrests and convictions indicating past behavior that could lead to more issues.\"),\n    (\"Age and Height\", \"low\", \"No direct impact from being 5 feet 10 inches; within average range for his age.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are underlying family issues not mentioned.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior without proper support.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium high\", \"Held only one job in a year, which may indicate past issues with the legal system or personal problems affecting employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years suggests good mental health and stability.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \" recent feelings of low mood but managed to stay sober indicates positive mental state.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with four people at 18 is typical; no significant family issues mentioned.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"No religious affiliation doesn't necessarily correlate with recidivism risk unless there are underlying issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
