    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's break down all the factors provided.\n\nFirst, he has a history of 4 arrests and convictions, which is significant. Repeated convictions usually indicate past criminal behavior that can predict future offenses.\n\nHis age is 18, so he's still developing, but that might be a mitigating factor if he's in a situation where he can turn things around, like with support.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I'm not sure how his weight relates to recidivism unless it's about substance use, which we'll get into.\n\nLiving alone without a high school diploma or GED means he might have limited opportunities for better education or job prospects, potentially leading to more involvement in the criminal system.\n\nHe's never married and currently living alone. Living with family can provide support, but being alone might mean he has fewer resources and could be more isolated from help.\n\nHe worked one job during the year. Maybe this indicates some level of stability, but if it's a menial job or he doesn't utilize his skills for positive outcomes, that could be a risk.\n\nNot using drugs in the past four years is a good sign, so drug use might not be contributing to his issues, which could lower the risk associated with substance abuse.\n\nHe felt down recently and couldn't find joy. This might point towards mental health issues, which can complicate reintegration into society positively, increasing recidivism chances.\n\nHis early life was in a household of four, so maybe he experienced family dynamics that could have impacted his behavior or decision-making processes.\n\nBelieving that God has no role in his personal events suggests he may lack religious support or guidance, potentially affecting his ability to seek help or maintain positive relationships.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests (high), living alone with limited education and job stability (medium-high risk factors), recent negative mood (maybe medium), and family background (could be high). The mental health aspect could add another layer of complexity. \n\nI think the overall risk is high because of the arrest history, unstable living situation, and possible underlying issues affecting his ability to reintegrate positively.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Previous Arrests\", \"high\", \"High due to multiple prior convictions which indicate past criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone Without Education\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and lacking a high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities for positive change and stability.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of low mood without substance abuse could suggest underlying mental health issues affecting reintegration.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Experiencing family life and personal beliefs about God may influence his ability to seek support or maintain positive relationships.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
