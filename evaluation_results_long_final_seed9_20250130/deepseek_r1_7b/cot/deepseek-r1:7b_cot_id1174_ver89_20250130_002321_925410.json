    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearrest based on his factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number; multiple convictions usually indicate past issues which can lead to more criminal behavior in the future.\n\nHe's Black, but I don't think race is directly an indicator here unless there's bias, but since it's not mentioned elsewhere, maybe it doesn't play a role here.\n\nHis height and weight are given as 5'10\"/145 lbs. Not sure how that relates to risk assessment; perhaps irrelevant unless it affects his ability, like if he can't perform certain jobs, but nothing indicates that.\n\nHe's living alone with no spouse, so he doesn't have a partner for support or shared responsibilities. Living alone is associated with higher recidivism because there's no one to rely on when things go wrong.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education gaps can lead to unstable situations and higher chances of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness often leads to dependency issues and could increase the risk of committing crimes out of necessity.\n\nNot using drugs for four years but had a bad mood recently. While not using drugs, sometimes stress can lead to self-harm or risky behaviors which might affect his judgment.\n\nAt a young age lived in a household of four. Maybe he was part of a larger family; could indicate different support structures compared to smaller households, possibly more supervision at times.\n\nBelieves God has no role in his life. This could be a sign of personal belief issues or lack of faith which might affect his motivation towards positive change.\n\nNow, putting it all together: multiple arrests, living alone, low education, joblessness, recent negative mood, and personal beliefs. All these factors point towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has several red flags that suggest a high risk of rearrest. Multiple past convictions, living alone, limited education, joblessness, recent negative mood, and personal beliefs all contribute to an elevated risk assessment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests (4) and convictions, which indicates prior criminal behavior that can lead to increased risk of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone is often associated with higher recidivism rates as there is no one to provide support or stability during times of need.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma and not enrolled in college can lead to unstable situations and increased opportunities for engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Limited Employment\", \"high\", \"Holding only one job for a year suggests potential dependency issues and increased vulnerability to criminal behavior as there may be fewer resources or motivations to commit crimes.\"),\n    (\"Recent Negative Mood\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing low mood can lead to self-harm or risky behaviors, which might affect judgment and decision-making in potentially harmful situations.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living with four family members as a youth may have provided some level of stability compared to smaller households, though this is not directly a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"Belief in Lack of God Influence\", \"medium\", \"Personal beliefs about the lack of divine involvement can affect motivation and perspective but does not directly correlate strongly with criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
