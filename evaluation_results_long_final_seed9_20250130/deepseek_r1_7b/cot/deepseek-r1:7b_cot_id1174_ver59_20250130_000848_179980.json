    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and convictions. That's a high number, so that definitely increases his risk. High risk because multiple prior convictions are a strong indicator of future behavior.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. Weight isn't directly related to recidivism unless there's other info, but it's probably not a factor here. So low risk for this factor.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates due to fewer support systems. Medium risk because living alone might mean he relies on himself more, which could contribute to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational barriers often lead to unstable situations, so medium risk here since not having an education can affect his ability to find stable employment or make positive choices.\n\nHolding only one job during the year might indicate he's under employable age or has limited opportunities. Medium risk because relying on a single job could mean instability if that job changes or ends.\n\nNo recent drug use for four years is actually a good sign, so no contribution here. Low risk.\n\nFeeling down and not finding joy in life could lead to substance abuse or neglecting responsibilities. Medium risk since this might indicate he's struggling with mental health issues which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age living in a household of four might have had challenges that contributed to his current issues, but I'm not sure if it directly links to recidivism. Low risk here as family size alone doesn't predict much without more context.\n\nNot believing in God could affect his motivation and values, possibly leading him towards negative choices. Medium risk because this lack of faith might be a motivator for criminal behavior or risky decisions.\n\nPutting all the factors together: high from prior convictions, medium from living alone, medium from low education, medium from job status, no contribution from drug use, medium from mental state, and medium from family background. The overall prediction is YES with 58% confidence because multiple factors point towards higher risk despite some mitigating elements like drug-free period.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests (4) and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can contribute to isolation and potential substance abuse, which may lead to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college can result in limited opportunities and unstable situations that may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job for the past year may indicate limited opportunities, which could lead to job loss or instability as a contributing factor to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and not finding joy in life may contribute to substance abuse or neglecting responsibilities, which can increase risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with family at a young age (household size 4) does not directly indicate high risk but could imply past challenges that might influence current behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Considering God has nothing to do with personal events may affect motivation and values, potentially leading to negative choices or increased risk of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 58\n}\n```",
