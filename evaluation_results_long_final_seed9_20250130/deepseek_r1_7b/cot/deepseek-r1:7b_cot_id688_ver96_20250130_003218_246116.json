    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query where the user is asking me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They want me to assign relative weights\u2014low, medium, high\u2014to each of several factors they've provided for a 21-year-old female and then predict her rearrest recidivism over three years with confidence.\n\nFirst off, I need to parse all the information given. Let's list out the factors:\n\n- Age: 21, White.\n- Arrests: 1 time, convicted.\n- Physical stats: 6'1\", 163 lbs.\n- Marital status: Never married, living alone.\n- Education: Associate or junior college, currently in a 2-year college.\n- Employment: Held 1 job last year.\n- Drug use: marijuana past four years, no recent depression.\n- Household history: At young age, household size was 4.\n- Beliefs: God has something to do with her personal events.\n\nNow, I need to assess each factor's impact on recidivism risk. I'll go through each one step by step.\n\n1. **Age and Race**: Being a young female (21) might suggest she's still developing skills, but race can indicate systemic issues affecting her opportunities. However, without specific data linking age or race to higher rearrest rates among females, it's safer to consider these as low risk factors since they don't strongly correlate with recidivism typically.\n\n2. **Previous Arrests and Convictions**: One arrest and conviction is a red flag. Recidivists often have prior convictions due to substance abuse or other behavioral issues. So this factor should be high weight because it directly relates to past problematic behavior leading to reoffending.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics**: Height and weight don't usually correlate with recidivism unless related to substance use, which isn't mentioned here. So these are low factors as they don't provide relevant info on behavior or risk.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Alone**: Being single and living alone can sometimes indicate higher stress levels, but without evidence of past issues like domestic violence or drug use, it's a neutral factor. It doesn't strongly suggest high risk; maybe medium if there were other indicators of instability.\n\n5. **Education Level**: Completed associate education and currently in college. Higher education is generally linked to lower recidivism rates because it can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability. So this should be low weight as higher education mitigates risk.\n\n6. **Employment**: Held one job last year. Employment, especially full-time, is a positive indicator for reintegration into society and reducing recidivism. So medium weight since while employment is good, one job might not indicate long-term stability.\n\n7. **Drug Use and Depression**: She admitted to marijuana use in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to substance abuse issues contributing to further crimes. However, recent depression isn't noted, so maybe this is low weight unless there's a history of substance abuse linked to other offenses.\n\n8. **Household History**: At young age in a household of four. Sibling households are sometimes associated with higher recidivism due to potential family dysfunction or stressors. This could be medium weight as it suggests some instability that might contribute to risk.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: She believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior but don't directly correlate with higher recidivism rates unless there's a history of sinning leading to further issues, which isn't provided here. So low weight.\n\nNow, compiling these factors: the main red flags are the arrest and previous convictions (high), education and employment (low), household history (medium). Drug use is in the past but recent depression not mentioned\u2014maybe medium if there's a history of substance abuse linked to prior issues.\n\nPutting it all together, I assign weights based on how each factor contributes to recidivism. The high weight factors are one arrest, previous convictions, and household history. Medium includes education and employment. Drug use is low unless there's more info.\n\nSo the prediction: considering one prior arrest and conviction, living in a potentially stressful household, but with some positive factors like education and recent job experience, it's on the higher risk side. So I'd lean towards high confidence of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Race\", \"low\", \"Age is 21, which may indicate a developing individual with less life experience.
