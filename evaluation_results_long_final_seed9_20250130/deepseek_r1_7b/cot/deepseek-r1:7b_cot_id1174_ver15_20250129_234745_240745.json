    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. He has a history of being arrested four times and convicted once. That's a solid indicator that he's had issues with the law before, which is usually a bad sign.\n\nHe's only 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. I don't know how his weight affects recidivism, but maybe his lower weight could mean he might not be as stable or responsible in some situations.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so that's one factor. Being single can sometimes lead to higher rates of re-arrest because there's no one to support him if something goes wrong.\n\nNo high school diploma and no GED means he didn't finish school, which is often linked to lower self-esteem or lack of opportunities once released from prison.\n\nHe only held one job in the past year. Joblessness can contribute to substance abuse and other negative behaviors that might lead to more trouble.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs for four years but felt down recently. While he's clean now, he had some bad feelings before. Maybe that could affect his motivation or ability to stay sober.\n\nLiving with a household of four at an early age might have influenced his behavior or decision-making skills as a teen.\n\nHe believes in God and says it doesn't affect him personally. That could relate to his personal beliefs influencing his actions, but I'm not sure how strong that is for recidivism risk.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, no education, lack of support system, joblessness, and living alone all point towards a high risk. His recent feelings might be related to substance issues or low self-esteem, which are risk factors too.\n\nSo I think the relative weights would be high for each factor because they're all strong indicators. The prediction is high confidence in re-arrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests and convictions indicate a history of problematic behavior which can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education or GED may limit opportunities for positive development, increasing risk of substance abuse or unstable situations that lead to further crimes.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone without a support system can exacerbate stress and negative behaviors, potentially leading to higher rates of re-arrest due to isolation and lack of accountability.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Only holding one job for a year may suggest limited opportunities or instability which could contribute to substance abuse issues, affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests he is sober, but recent low moods might indicate underlying issues like substance abuse or depression that could reemerge and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living with four people at an early age may have influenced his behavior but does not directly correlate strongly to recidivism risk as adult factors would play more of a role over time.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"His belief in God affecting personal decisions is speculative and might not directly impact recidivism unless it relates to other aspects like substance abuse or lack of motivation, which are not explicitly stated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
