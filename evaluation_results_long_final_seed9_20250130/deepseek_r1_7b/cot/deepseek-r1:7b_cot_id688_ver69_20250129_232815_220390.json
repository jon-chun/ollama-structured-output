    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female with several factors that could influence her rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and decision-making processes. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe has a White racial background. While race can be a factor in some contexts, it's important to note that this dataset might not have enough information on how race specifically affects her risk here. I'll treat it as medium unless more info is available.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction. A prior conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism because she's already had legal issues which could impact her ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs. This might indicate she's athletic or in a certain profession, but without knowing if it affects her job stability or behavior, I can't be sure. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nLiving alone as a single person could mean less support network, which might increase stress and substance use issues, both of which are risk factors. So that's another high factor.\n\nShe has aAssociate/Junior College degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can be a positive or negative depending on the context. If she's motivated to succeed academically, it might reduce risk; however, sometimes students struggle with substance use while studying. So perhaps medium to high? Maybe medium.\n\nShe held one job during the year, which is better than not working but could mean she has gaps in income support or life skills if that job was unstable. That's a moderate risk factor.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years.Marijuana use isn't as severe as harder drugs like cocaine or crack, but even occasional use can affect mental health and self-control. Since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe she's managing it well, so perhaps medium.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's a positive sign, which might lower her risk compared to someone with ongoing mental health issues. So that's somewhat mitigating but still not low.\n\nYoung household at age: Living with three others as a child can sometimes lead to increased stress or neglect if family dynamics aren't good. But since she's an adult now living alone, maybe this isn't directly relevant anymore.\n\nBelief in God: Her religious beliefs might influence her behavior through moral guidance but don't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are underlying issues like mental illness. Without more info, treat it as medium.\n\nPutting all together: High risk due to prior conviction and lack of support (living alone), moderate from education and job experience, some mitigating factors from drug use and mental health. The strongest factors point towards a high risk, so the model might predict YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Her age of 21 may increase her chances of recidivism as she is still developing her skills and decision-making processes.\"),\n    (\"Racial Background\", \"medium\", \"While race can be a factor, without specific data it's treated as medium risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction increases the likelihood of recidivism due to past legal issues and potential relapse factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially leading to increased stress and substance use which are risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"While she has a higher education level, it's important to consider if the motivation for continued studies is strong and whether this translates into positive life changes.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"moderate\", \"Holding one job may indicate some stability but could also suggest potential gaps in income support or life skills that might contribute to recidivism over time.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \" occasional marijuana use can affect mental health and self-control, though her recent lack of depression mitigates this factor somewhat.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Recent\", \"moderate negative\", \"Her recent lack of depression is a positive sign but she hasn't experienced any mental health issues that could impact her decision-making or behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low to medium\", \"Living in a household of four as a young adult may indicate potential family dynamics issues, though since she's now an adult living alone, this factor is less relevant but still present to some degree.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Her belief in God does not directly correlate with recidivism unless there are underlying mental health issues or moral guidance that influences her behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
