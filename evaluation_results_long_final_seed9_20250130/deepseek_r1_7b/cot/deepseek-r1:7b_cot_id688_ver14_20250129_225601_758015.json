    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female having recidivism within three years. She's white, has one prior arrest and conviction, is 6'1\" and 163 lbs, living alone, never married. Her education is associate or junior college with ongoing college, one job in the past year, drug use only marijuana in the last four years, no depression in the past month. She grew up in a household of four and believes in God.\n\nFirst, age: 21 might be too young for prior convictions, but she's had one so that's a point. However, maybe it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nEthnicity is White, which isn't directly a risk factor, but sometimes being non-Hispanic can correlate with lower recidivism rates in some studies, though it might vary based on other factors.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'1\"/163 lbs. I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe body type doesn't impact recidivism much unless there's a history of substance abuse or related issues, which she hasn't mentioned except for marijuana use.\n\nShe's living alone with no partner. Living situation can influence support systems but without more info on isolation or stressors, it's hard to say.\n\nNever married and currently single: Marital status isn't typically a direct risk factor unless there's a history of abuse in the family, which she hasn't mentioned.\n\nEducation level: Associate/Junior College with ongoing college. Higher education can correlate with lower recidivism as they might have better job opportunities or support systems.\n\nEmployment: One job past year. Employment generally reduces recidivism since having a stable income can prevent turning to criminal activities.\n\nDrug use: Only marijuana in the last four years and no depression recently. Drug use is sometimes linked to higher recidivism, especially if it's related to other criminal behaviors or if there's a history of substance abuse leading to more risky situations.\n\nReligious belief: Believes in God; maybe this indicates a sense of structure but not necessarily related to risk factors unless there's evidence that religious beliefs influence behavior which isn't provided here.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four doesn't directly indicate anything about her personal stability or family dynamics, though larger households can sometimes correlate with less supervision.\n\nPutting it all together: She has one prior conviction, which is somewhat concerning. Her living situation and education are positive indicators. Drug use could be a red flag if it's leading to more risky behavior. Without more info on substance abuse history or surrounding circumstances, her risk might lean towards medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has one prior arrest and conviction which can indicate past criminal behavior that may influence future recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Having a job in the past year suggests stability and reduced likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
