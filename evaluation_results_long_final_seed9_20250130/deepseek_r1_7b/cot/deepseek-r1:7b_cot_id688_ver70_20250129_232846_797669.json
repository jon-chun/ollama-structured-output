    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is quite young at 21, which might indicate higher recidivism rates as she's still developing. But since she has one prior arrest and conviction, that's a significant risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I know race can be a factor in recidivism studies due to systemic issues, so it should be considered as a low weight factor but still present.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; maybe they could relate to other factors like physical activity, but since no info is given on that, they might not contribute much. I'll assign them medium or low based on lack of data.\n\nShe's living alone with no dependents, which can reduce supervision and support, increasing risk. That's a medium-high factor.\n\nCompleting associate college and currently in another might indicate some education but could also mean she's seeking help, so maybe medium.\n\nHolding one job is okay, but not much information on its impact beyond employment stability; perhaps low weight if stable, but unsure.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years.Marijuana use isn't as severe as hard drugs and doesn't carry the same risk, so this might be a low factor unless it's frequent or recent causing issues.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month is positive, indicating mental well-being, which would lower her risk; medium weight because it's one data point but relevant.\n\nPast household size of four could mean living with others who might have different dynamics affecting her now living alone. Maybe moderate risk contribution.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with her life\u2014religion can influence behavior but varies widely; maybe low to medium based on personal belief strength.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest, age, living alone, and drug use are significant factors. The positive mental health might offset some of that. I think the overall risk is high because despite her positive signs, several negative factors point towards higher recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age is quite young at 21 years old, which may indicate a higher likelihood of rearrest as she is still developing and entering into her twenties.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can be a factor in recidivism studies due to systemic issues, there isn't enough information to suggest this individual has a higher risk based on being White alone.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years.
