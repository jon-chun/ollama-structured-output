His age means he's likely still developing, but recidivism can be influenced by other factors too.\n\nHe's only 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. Body weight might influence his ability to commit certain offenses, but it's not a direct indicator of risk unless combined with behavior.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision, which is concerning in terms of potential for immediate access to resources or environments conducive to illegal activities.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he might have struggled academically, possibly leading him into criminal paths. Being out of college can sometimes correlate with unstable situations or higher rates of reoffending after release.\n\nHe's employed one job recently, which is positive as unemployment can be a motivator for crime but maybe he's found a way to stay stable.\n\nNot using drugs in the past four years is a good sign; drug use often correlates with criminal behavior. However, his recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues that might not be addressed.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four doesn't directly indicate risk, but family dynamics can play a role depending on how supportive or neglectful things were during his youth.\n\nHis lack of faith in God could relate to other personal issues like alcoholism or substance abuse, which are known risk factors for recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these factors together\u2014history of convictions, age-related potential for instability, living situation, education level, job history, drug use, and mental health\u2014the risk assessment suggests a high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, which are significant indicators of past criminal behavior and potential for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At the age of 18, the individual is still developing and may be more susceptible to influences that could lead to recidivism.
