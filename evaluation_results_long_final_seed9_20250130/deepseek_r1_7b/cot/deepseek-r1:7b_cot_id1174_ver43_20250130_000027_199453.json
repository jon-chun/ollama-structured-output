    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's a strong indicator of past issues, which usually means higher risk because reoffending is more likely.\n\nHis age is 18, so he's still developing. Young adults often have more unstable lives or less life experience compared to older individuals, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's living alone and hasn't married anyone yet. Living alone might mean he's responsible for his own well-being but could also be a sign of instability if he's struggling with personal issues.\n\nHis education level is low\u2014he has no high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Education can play a big role in job opportunities and stability, so not having one might increase his risk.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to economic instability, which might push him towards criminal activities as a means of survival.\n\nNot using drugs for four years is positive, but sometimes not doing something can be a cover for deeper issues like anxiety or depression that he's suppressing.\n\nHe feels down and couldn't cheer himself up recently. This could indicate underlying mental health issues, which are significant predictors in recidivism.\n\nAt 18, his background was in a household of four. A larger family might have different dynamics, but if he felt neglected or supported well, it could be different. However, if he was part of a larger group without enough individual support, that's concerning.\n\nHis lack of belief in God suggests he might not seek spiritual guidance for stress relief, which could mean relying on other mechanisms\u2014potentially leading to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrest convictions, young age, living alone, low education, limited job experience, recent drug-free period but possible mental health issues, and a family background that might not provide adequate support. All these factors point towards high recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior which increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age at 18 may suggest limited life experience, which can be associated with higher recidivism risk in certain circumstances.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally considered stable but could indicate personal issues that might contribute to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED and not attending college may limit opportunities and stability, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"low\", \"Only one job in a year suggests limited economic independence and potential lack of support systems which could lead to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs for four years is positive but could mask underlying mental health issues that might contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with family of size four at a young age may indicate different dynamics, but if neglected or unsupported, it can be concerning.\"),\n    (\"religious belief\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement may suggest reliance on other stress-relief mechanisms which could contribute to risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
