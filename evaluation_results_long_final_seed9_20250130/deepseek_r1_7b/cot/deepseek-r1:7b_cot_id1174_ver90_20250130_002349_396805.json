    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of this 18-year-old Black male for rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's pretty significant. Recidivists often have multiple prior convictions, which increases their chances of reoffending. So that's high risk.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I'm not sure how height and weight relate to recidivism in this context, but maybe his body type isn't directly related to behavior or risk factors, so the impact might be low.\n\nLiving alone is a factor here because living with family can provide support and reduce stressors that might lead to substance abuse or other issues. Since he's living alone, it might slightly lower his risk compared to others, but still not the lowest.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete basic education, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates because of lack of skills and support systems. That's a medium-high factor.\n\nHe's only held one job in the past year. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substances as a way to cope or other negative behaviors that might increase the risk. That's high.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, but he felt down recently. Chronic stress or mental health issues without professional help could be underlying factors contributing to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. This is medium-high because while he doesn't use drugs now, the recent feelings of low mood might indicate other issues that need addressing.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age, which suggests he wasn't in a stable environment early on. That could be a risk factor due to exposure to negative influences or instability leading to behavioral issues later. High risk.\n\nHis belief in God is strong and unrelated to his personal events. This could affect his mental health approachability; if he's harder to talk to about mental health issues, it might hinder support efforts that could help reduce recidivism. Medium-high because the lack of religious support doesn't directly cause crime but can influence access to resources.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions (high), no education (medium high), recent stress or mood issues (medium high), living alone is slightly mitigating, but his background and belief in God are contributing factors. The overall risk assessment would lean towards high because of the significant past criminal history and lack of education and employment stability.\n</think>\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of each factor related to recidivism:\n\n- **Multiple prior convictions**: High risk due to significant criminal history.\n- **No education or GED**: Medium-high risk as it often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n- **Recent stress/mood issues**: Medium-high risk indicating possible underlying mental health concerns.\n\nWhile factors like living alone and lack of job stability slightly mitigate, the overall risk is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal history (4 arrests)\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior convictions significantly increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level (no diploma or GED)\", \"medium-high\", \"Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited support systems and skills.\");\n    (\"Mental health issues (recent feelings of low mood)\", \"medium-high\", \"Chronic stress or mental health issues without professional help can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
