    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female with various factors contributing to her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's significant because recidivism can increase from early adulthood.\n\nShe identifies as White, which might influence the risk assessment based on racial statistics, though it's not always directly predictive.\n\nHer physical characteristics are average height and weight; no direct impact here.\n\nLiving alone is a point to consider. Being in a stable living situation generally reduces risk factors like substance abuse or domestic issues contributing to recidivism.\n\nEducational background: She has an associate degree and is in college. College completion often correlates with better job prospects, which can aid in stability and reduce criminal tendencies.\n\nEmployment history shows she only held one job last year. While a short period might not indicate much, if she's actively seeking another or has skills that prevent reoffending, this could be positive.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is generally less severe than harder drugs and doesn't always lead to substance abuse issues affecting recidivism as significantly.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which suggests she's stable mentally, reducing stress or other mental factors that could contribute to crime.\n\nHousehold size at a young age was four. Larger households might have different dynamics, but without more info on those dynamics, it's hard to assess how this affects her current risk.\n\nReligious belief: She believes in God\u2019s role in her life. While religious factors can influence behavior, they don't directly point towards higher or lower recidivism rates unless there are known correlations, which aren't typically strong.\n\nPutting all these together, the main factors that could predict rearrest are past criminal history and any potential underlying issues like substance abuse. Her education and stable living situation suggest better outcomes. However, the recent marijuana use without severe depression might be a minor factor but still contributes to risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21 years old, which can influence recidivism rates as individuals transition from early adulthood to adulthood.
