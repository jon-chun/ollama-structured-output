    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a 21-year-old female has a high risk of rearrest within the next three years. She's White, hasn't been married, living alone, has some education, one job, used marijuana in the past four years, and her household was size four when she was younger.\n\nFirst, her age is just over 21, so maybe she's just starting out, but that might not directly affect her risk. Her race is White; I'm not sure how much of an impact that has on recidivism compared to other groups, but it could be a factor depending on systemic issues or personal choices.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior. So that might push her towards high risk.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant here. She's living alone, which can be a protective factor since living with others sometimes means someone is available to help if she needs it, but on the other hand, being an only child or in a single situation might make her feel more vulnerable.\n\nShe has some education background\u2014associate degree and currently enrolled in college. Education can be a mitigating factor because it often leads to better job opportunities and higher earnings, which can reduce recidivism risk. But if she's not completing her education, that could be a concern.\n\nOnly one job might indicate part-time work or maybe unemployment, but again, depends on the type of job. If it's stable, that's positive; if not, negative. She used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana specifically. Drug use can have cognitive and behavioral effects, potentially leading to more impulsive decisions.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in a month, which might be a sign of mental health. Sometimes substance abuse can lead to depression, so that's a bit conflicting. If she's using marijuana but not feeling depressed, maybe she's managing it well or doesn't rely on it heavily for coping.\n\nFamily history when she was young\u2014household size four could mean she had more supervision or support growing up, which is protective. But if the environment wasn't positive, that might be a risk factor too.\n\nConsidering all these factors: prior arrest (high), drug use (medium?), living alone (maybe medium depending on context). The education suggests she's proactive, but only one job could be low to medium risk depending on stability.\n\nPutting it all together, her prior offense and drug use are strong indicators of a high risk. The other factors might not balance them out enough.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Criminal Record\", \"high\", \"Her one arrest and conviction significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can lead to impulsive decisions and has cognitive-behavioral effects that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"While living alone can be a protective factor in some contexts, it can also increase vulnerability depending on personal circumstances and support networks.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having an associate degree and currently enrolled in college suggests some educational stability, which may mitigate risk but does not guarantee no risk factors related to substance use or instability in employment.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month may indicate good mental health, though substance use could be a coping mechanism that should be monitored.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
