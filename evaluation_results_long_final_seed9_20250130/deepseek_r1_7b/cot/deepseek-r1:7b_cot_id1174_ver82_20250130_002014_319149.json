    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's pretty significant. Recidivism often follows past criminal behavior, so that might lean towards high risk.\n\nHe's only 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I'm not sure how height affects recidivism directly, but his weight is in the lower end. Maybe he's underweight? Could that affect his ability to handle substance use or job opportunities? Not sure yet, but maybe it's a medium factor.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse and no children. Living soliton can lead to isolation, which might contribute to substance abuse or other behavioral issues. That could be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't graduate on time. Educational challenges can sometimes result in risky behaviors. So that's another low to medium factor.\n\nHe only held one job during the year. Joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates because of lack of support and increased substance use. That definitely points towards high risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a positive sign, but the recent feeling of despair might suggest underlying issues like mental health problems. That could be medium to low depending on how it's addressed.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes provide more support and stability, so that might actually lower risk, making this factor low.\n\nHis belief in God is strong but doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless he's using religion as an excuse or avoiding help. I'd say this has no direct impact, maybe neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: four arrests, lack of education, joblessness are major red flags. His living situation isn't terrible, and his drug use is clean but recent despair might indicate mental health issues which could be a concern. So the overall risk seems high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests and two convictions, indicating past criminal behavior that often correlates with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Educational Background\", \"low\", \"Lacking a high school diploma or GED may present challenges in obtaining future employment or support, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Only holding one job during the year suggests instability and potential lack of support systems, which are often linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a spouse may contribute to isolation, potentially leading to substance abuse or other behavioral issues that can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of despair could indicate underlying mental health issues that might be contributing to risky behavior, though this factor is not directly tied to recidivism but requires addressing support mechanisms.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of four suggests early-life social support which can mitigate some risk factors associated with living alone later on.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
