    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Young adults can be at higher risk because they might still be developing their skills and decision-making. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White, which isn't directly related to recidivism but could imply some societal factors or systemic issues affecting her, so maybe medium.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction. Recidivists are more likely to reoffend, so this is high.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; no impact on risk.\n\nLiving alone might increase vulnerability, so that's a medium factor.\n\nEducation level: associate/junior college and currently in college. College attendance can correlate with lower recidivism because of better skills or support, but she only completed one before starting college, which is low.\n\nHeld one job recently; consistent employment usually reduces risk as it provides stability, so maybe low.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can have negative consequences and might predict higher recidivism if it leads to further issues, so medium.\n\nMental health: she hasn't felt depressed recently. Positive mental state is linked with lower risk, so that's a low factor.\n\nHousehold size at young age was 4; larger families sometimes correlate with more supervision but could also have more support, which might be low or medium depending on context.\n\nBelief in God\u2014religion can influence behavior and help in recovery, so maybe medium positive impact.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age (21) and prior conviction. Medium factors include living alone, drug use, household size, religion, education, mental health, job history. Low factors are race, education completion, and consistent employment. \n\nGiven the prior arrest and conviction, along with other medium factors like drug use and living alone, it's a moderate risk but not extremely high. Maybe low to medium confidence in predicting rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young adults are at higher risk due to developing skills and decision-making abilities.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Cultural background might imply systemic issues affecting recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Number of prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Previous criminal history increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Consistent living arrangement with no indication of instability supports lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Current education and past completion suggest stability and support systems that reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"low\", \"Recent job holding indicates employment stability, which reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history\", \"medium\", \" drug use in the past can have negative consequences that may increase reoffending risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"Positive mental state correlates with lower recidivism risk as it indicates better emotional stability.\"),\n    (\"Household size at young age\", \"medium\", \"Larger households often provide more supervision, but without direct evidence of support, this factor is medium.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Religious belief can influence behavior and recovery efforts, positively impacting risk reduction.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
