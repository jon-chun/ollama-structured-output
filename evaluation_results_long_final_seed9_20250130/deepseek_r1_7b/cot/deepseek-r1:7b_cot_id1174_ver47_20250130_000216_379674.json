    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times with a conviction\u2014four prior convictions are definitely high because that's multiple serious offenses which can really impact his risk assessment.\n\nHis age is 18, but I'm not sure how significant that is compared to others in the population. Maybe it's medium weight since being younger might sometimes be associated with lower recidivism, but he also has a history of more severe offenses.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs\u2014height and weight aren't usually considered unless there's a risk of physical harm or something like that. So maybe this is low impact.\n\n living alone: yes, living alone can be an indicator of higher risk because he might not have support to help him through tough times. That could be medium-high.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014this is a significant factor because lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited job opportunities and skills for rehabilitation. So this would be high weight.\n\nHe's never married, living alone again\u2014which reinforces the living situation as a risk factor. High weight here too.\n\nOnly held one job in the past year: having a job is positive, but if he's not employed full-time or has had issues with it before, maybe that's a medium negative because part-time work might be tough to sustain.\n\nNo drug use for four years\u2014this is very positive and low risk factor. The mention of feeling down some months suggests possible depression or other mental health issues which I should consider next.\n\nYoung age in a larger household: He mentions living with three others, so maybe the size of the household could influence his environment's supportiveness. A larger household might have more help, but since it's mentioned he lives alone now, perhaps that factor is lower weight.\n\nBelieves God has no role in his life\u2014this indicates he doesn't have religious support or guidance which can be associated with higher recidivism as people without strong support systems often turn to other factors like drugs or crime for relief. High weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: four prior convictions (high), living alone twice, lack of education and job (high each), no drug use (low), and no religious support (high). The negative factors seem to be his current solitary living but maybe the positive aspects of not using drugs and having some mental health issues could temper that.\n\nThe prediction is likely high risk for rearrest in three years. His prior convictions, lack of education, and living situation are strong indicators. Even though he's not using drugs now, the other factors point towards a high chance of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Four prior convictions indicate significant past criminal history which is strongly associated with higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium-high\", \"Living alone, especially at a young age, can increase stress and isolation, which may contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma/GED is a strong indicator of lower educational opportunities and potential for reengaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"current_job\", \"medium\", \"Only one job held may indicate limited support system, which could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors if the job does not provide stability or purpose.\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use\", \"low\", \"Four years without drug use is a positive indicator of potential for better control over substance abuse and overall well-being.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium-high\", \"Feeling down some months may indicate underlying mental health issues which can contribute to substance abuse, self-harm, or criminal behavior if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
