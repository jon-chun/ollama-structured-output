Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's a significant factor; multiple prior convictions definitely increase the risk of rearrest. So that's high weight.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. Weight alone doesn't typically correlate with recidivism unless it's linked to other issues, which isn't mentioned here. Maybe not much impact, so perhaps medium.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes lead to higher stress or isolation, but without specific info on why he's living that way, maybe low weight.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college shows he has limited educational opportunities, which often ties into recidivism because education is a key factor. So medium weight here.\n\nOnly one job in the past year could mean unstable income, which might lead to other issues contributing to reoffending. Medium again.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs for four years and felt low mood recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it's relapsing, but since he's clean now, maybe lower weight.\n\nYoung age at 18 with past issues suggests he started early, which is usually associated with higher recidivism rates. High weight.\n\nPast household size of four doesn't directly indicate anything unless there was instability, which isn't stated. Maybe low.\n\nNo belief in God could affect his motivation or decision-making, but it's a personal choice and not directly tied to recidivism stats. Perhaps medium.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple high factors (criminal history, age) likely push the prediction towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has several risk factors that collectively suggest a high likelihood of rearrest. The multiple prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the risk. While other factors like living alone or limited education may have less impact, they still contribute to the overall assessment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests (4) and convictions (2) significantly increase the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Age at 18 with a history of early involvement in criminal activities is typically associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, coupled with not attending college, may present challenges but doesn't directly correlate to rearrest as strongly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"job stability\", \"low\", \"Only one job in the past year indicates possible instability, which can contribute but isn't a predominant factor compared to other risk indicators.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years and recent mood issues that may not be related to substance abuse are minor factors compared to other risk indicators like criminal history and age.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
