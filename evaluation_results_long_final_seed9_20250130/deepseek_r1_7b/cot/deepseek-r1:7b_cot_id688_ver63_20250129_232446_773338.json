    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female rearresting within three years. Let me break down each factor she has.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which isn't too old but also not young. Maybe it's a bit early for recidivism? Not sure yet.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there can be disparities based on race, so that's something to consider\u2014maybe higher or lower risk compared to other groups.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. One offense isn't great, but maybe it's not repeated. The nature of the crime is probably important too\u2014since she used marijuana in the past four years, maybe she had drug-related issues when she was arrested. But that might be mitigated now if she's getting help.\n\nShe's 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs. That doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless there's something about her weight management or health affecting her ability to reintegrate, but nothing suggests that here.\n\nLiving alone is a point against her. Being in a stable environment might reduce risk factors like domestic violence or neglect. But since she's living alone now, maybe she has better control over her safety.\n\nShe hasn't been married and lives alone. So no partner to support her if something goes wrong. That could be both pro and con depending on other factors.\n\nHer education level: associate degree and currently in college. College completion is usually positive for employment and stability, which can reduce recidivism. But sometimes, being in school might mean she's still jobless or underemployed.\n\nShe held one job during the year. One job is better than none, but maybe not enough to provide steady income support. If she lost her job due to substance use issues, that could be a red flag. She used drugs in the past four years, which can impair judgment and increase risk behaviors.\n\nHer mental health: she hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's good because depression is a risk factor for substance abuse and recidivism. But if she struggled with it before, maybe she has underlying issues that haven't shown yet.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. A bigger family might have provided more support or stability when she was younger, which could help reduce risk factors like exposure to violence or neglect now.\n\nHer spiritual belief: considers God involved in her life. That's a positive factor as spirituality often correlates with better substance use and lower recidivism rates.\n\nPutting this all together, her recent drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to relapse, impaired decision-making, and increased involvement in criminal activities. The past arrest isn't repeated yet, so maybe that's low risk unless there are underlying issues like mental health problems or family instability that aren't mentioned here.\n\nHer being White might not directly affect her risk unless there are systemic issues at play. However, she's now living alone without a partner, which could be isolating and risky if she struggles with substance use.\n\nHer education is positive, but having one job isn't enough to ensure stability. If she lost the job due to drug use or other issues, that could affect her ability to reintegrate positively into society.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which suggests good mental health, reducing some risk factors like substance abuse persistence.\n\nThe household size at a young age might have provided support but doesn't necessarily correlate with lower recidivism in her current situation unless she's benefited from that environment now.\n\nSo weighing all these: the significant risk comes from recent drug use and potential underlying issues. The positive factors are education, living alone without a partner (but maybe if she's isolated, that could be bad), and good mental health. \n\nI think her overall risk is medium because while there are some mitigating factors like education and mental health, the biggest risk is from her recent drug use which could lead to relapse in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Recent Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Her recent marijuana use poses a significant risk of relapse, which can lead to criminal behavior and rearrest within three years.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone Without a Partner\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces some risk factors but may also increase isolation risk if she struggles with substance use or other issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
