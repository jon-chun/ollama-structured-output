    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the rearrest recidivism risk for this individual based on her factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 21. Young adults can sometimes be more impulsive or have higher substance use rates, which might increase risk. But she has a high school diploma and is in college, so education level seems positive. She's never been married living alone, maybe less support network. Drug use only once in four years isn't bad.\n\nShe uses marijuana occasionally but hasn't felt depressed recently. That could be linked to drug use, which might affect her stability or decision-making. However, she completed junior college and is in a 2-year program, so some higher education is there.\n\nMarital status: single, living alone. Being single can sometimes mean less support for substance use or seeking help, but it's also possible that isolation could contribute to issues. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate she's doing okay mentally now.\n\nFamily history: at a young age, lived in a household of 4. More siblings might provide support and stability, reducing risk factors like drug abuse. If she's around family for help when needed, that's a positive. But sometimes larger families can have challenges too.\n\nGod involvement: She believes in God's role in her life. Religious beliefs often correlate with substance use denial or seeking help, but it could also mean she's seeking spiritual guidance for personal issues, which might aid recovery.\n\nPutting this all together, her education and current studies are positive signs. Drug use is infrequent, so that's a low risk factor. Marital status alone isn't a huge red flag since she's not feeling depressed lately. Family of four doesn't seem like a problem unless there were issues before. Her age might be a slight concern but tempered by her education and current situation.\n\nI think the factors lean more towards medium risk, especially considering some variables could still influence behavior.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, each factor is evaluated for its potential impact on rearrest recidivism:\n\n1. **Age**: 21 years old - Low risk due to higher educational attainment and current enrollment in college.\n\n2. **Education**: Associates/Junior College completed; enrolled in a 2-year college - High risk reduction as education level is positively correlated with lower recidivism.\n\n3. **Drug Use**: Marijuana use once in four years, no recent depression - Low risk since drug use frequency is low and mental health appears stable.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: Single, living alone - Medium risk due to possible isolation but no immediate red flags unless combined with substance abuse.\n\n5. **Family History**: At young age, household size 4 - Medium risk as family support can influence behavior; however, stability suggests less risk.\n\n6. **God Involvement**: Believes in God's role - Low risk, as religious involvement often correlates with seeking help and maintaining stability.\n\n**Prediction**: The collective factors lean towards a LOW relative weight for rearrest recidivism.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21 years old; age is a potential factor but tempered by positive factors like education and current studies\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"High risk reduction due to completed associates/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Drug use once in four years with no recent depression; indicates possible stability\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone as single, potential for isolation but no immediate red flags\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Household size 4 at young age; could influence behavior positively or negatively\"),\n    (\"God Involvement\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement often correlates with seeking help and stability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
