    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out this risk assessment for a 18-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times and has convictions, which is a red flag. His weight and height don't seem relevant here; it's more about his personal circumstances.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so he doesn't have any family support. That could mean he relies on himself for things like job stability or emotional support. He lacks a high school diploma or GED, which might indicate lower educational opportunities and higher chances of reoffending if he can't get good job training.\n\nHe's only held one job recently, so maybe his income isn't stable long-term. That could affect his ability to support himself without a steady source of income. He doesn't use drugs but had bad emotional moments recently; this might point towards potential mood issues affecting his behavior or decisions.\n\nHis past household size was four when he was young, which means he grew up in an environment with other siblings. This might have influenced his independence level or family dynamics that could impact his current living situation and decision-making.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, so he might not get the same emotional support as someone who does. That could affect his mental health and how he copes with stress or setbacks.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior convictions increase the risk of reoffending. Living alone without a spouse adds strain. His education level is low, which might limit opportunities for better job prospects. Unstable employment could lead to financial issues affecting his ability to stay out of trouble. Emotional and mental health factors are present but not severe yet. These factors together suggest a high relative weight in predicting reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"High risk due to multiple prior arrests and convictions which indicate past behavior patterns that may lead to similar outcomes if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases stress and isolation, potentially leading to behavioral issues or increased vulnerability to external influences.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and GED can limit opportunities for better job prospects and long-term stability, increasing the risk of reoffending in various areas of life including criminal justice\"),\n    (\"unstable_employment\", \"medium\", \"Only one job held recently indicates potential economic instability which could affect overall well-being and capacity to avoid further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"emotional_mood\", \"low\", \"No drug use but recent bad emotional state might indicate potential for mood swings or stressors affecting decision-making without severe manifestation of mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after a young age with siblings present suggests some family support, which may provide stability but also could lead to dependency on others if circumstances change.\"),\n    (\"no_god Belief\", \"low\", \"Non-religious beliefs might affect emotional and psychological support but not necessarily directly impact risk factors unless it affects coping mechanisms or belief systems that influence behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
