    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's definitely a red flag. Recidivistic tendencies often follow past convictions, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe's white, which might be related to some systemic issues, but since she's young and only has one prior offense, I'm not sure if race plays a significant role here compared to other factors.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and weight 163 lbs. While that could indicate her level of physical activity or potential substance use, it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless she's been involved in substance abuse recovery, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's living alone, which can sometimes be a safer environment, but her drug use history (only marijuana in the past four years) and not feeling depressed recently might suggest she could still seek substances or support. That's a bit contradictory and needs more analysis.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is currently single, so no family to rely on for support after incarceration. That could increase the risk of relapse because there's less external support network.\n\nShe has only held one job in the past year. Job instability can lead to economic strain, which might push someone back into substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nHer drug history is only marijuana and she hasn't felt depressed recently. While this isn't a major issue unless she's using harder drugs, it's not enough to lower her risk significantly.\n\nYoung age at first offense suggests she may have fewer life experiences that could build resilience against further offenses.\n\nShe believes in God, which might provide some personal support or moral guidance, potentially reducing the risk of relapse.\n\nPutting all this together: The prior arrest is a strong indicator. Other factors like living alone and joblessness are mitigating but not enough to offset the high initial risk from the conviction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"high\", \"A single prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as it indicates a history of criminal behavior that can predict future involvement in the legal system.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"While she has used marijuana, this is not severe drug abuse and does not strongly indicate a high risk of substance abuse-related recidivism.
