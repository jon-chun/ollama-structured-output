    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she's already been convicted once. That's a significant point because younger individuals might have different motivations or circumstances that could affect their behavior.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to socioeconomic factors and systemic issues, so this could be a medium factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant here; maybe they relate more to physical risk rather than behavioral.\n\nNever married and living alone: Being single and living alone might increase isolation, which could contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors. So that's probably a medium-high risk factor.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability, which usually reduce recidivism. But since she only completed her associate and is still in college, maybe it's on the lower end of high or perhaps medium.\n\nShe held one job during the year: Employed individuals are generally less likely to engage in illegal activities compared to those unemployed. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use past four years (marijuana): Past drug use can have long-term effects, even if she doesn't feel depressed now. Substance abuse often leads to other risky behaviors or increased criminal liability. This is definitely high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month: Lack of recent depression might suggest some level of mental stability, but it's possible she's dealing with issues that haven't presented themselves yet.\n\nYoung household at age: Growing up in a household of four could have different dynamics and possibly higher exposure to stressors or substance abuse, so this is medium-high.\n\nReligion: Believing in God doesn't directly cause crime but might influence behavior through moral values. Still, it's probably low impact unless there are other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The high risk from drug use and living situation, moderate from age and race, low from education and job status. The overall prediction is she has a higher chance of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her being 21 years old may indicate younger maturity but having already been convicted suggests potential for different motivations and circumstances affecting behavior.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can influence recidivism rates due to socioeconomic factors, her White identification does not directly correlate with higher risk without additional context on systemic issues or personal experiences.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone and never married may increase isolation, which could contribute to risky behaviors such as substance use that might lead to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having an associate degree and currently enrolled in college indicates some level of education but may not directly correlate with lower risk without considering other factors like employment status or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year suggests stability that can reduce opportunities for engaging in illegal activities, thus lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years is a significant factor as it may lead to increased criminal liability or risky behaviors that could contribute to future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests some level of mental stability, though long-term mental health issues could still arise without being noted here.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age\", \"medium-high\", \"Growing up in a household of four may have different dynamics that could potentially influence substance abuse or other risk factors affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"low\", \"Believing in God does not directly cause crime but might influence behavior through moral values, still likely to be low impact without additional context on personal beliefs and practices.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
