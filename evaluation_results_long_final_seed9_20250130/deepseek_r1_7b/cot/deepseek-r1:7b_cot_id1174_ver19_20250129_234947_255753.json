    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male who's been arrested four times and convicted. He's Black, living alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, hasn't college, only one job in the past year, no drug use in the past four years, and sometimes feels really down. His household was size four when he was young, and he doesn't believe in God affecting his life.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each factor step by step. He has a history of multiple arrests and convictions\u2014four times already. That's a strong indicator; more than one arrest significantly increases the risk of reoffending within three years. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nNext, his education level is low\u2014he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't going to college. Lack of education can be a big factor because it might limit opportunities and could lead him into similar situations again. High risk here too.\n\nHe lives alone, which can sometimes be a protective factor if he's around others for support, but in this case, maybe it's more about isolation leading to substance abuse or emotional issues. The fact that he doesn't have any drug use makes me think he's clean, so perhaps the lack of supervision isn't contributing here. But I'm not sure; maybe living alone can be a risk factor if there are underlying issues.\n\nHe has only held one job in the past year, which is another red flag. Unstable employment can lead to economic dependence and substance abuse as a way to cope or escape. High risk because of unemployment.\n\nHis recent feelings of down mood might point towards mental health issues. He hasn't used drugs but sometimes feels low. This could be related to substance abuse or depression, both of which can contribute to recidivism. So medium to high risk here.\n\nThe fact that he was in a household of four when young doesn't directly correlate with his current situation unless there were family issues that might have carried over. But without more info, it's hard to say\u2014maybe lower risk because family support is generally protective. Maybe low or medium?\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and feels no divine guidance. This could lead him to seek other sources of hope, which might not be positive if those sources are things like drugs or self-harm. But since he's clean now, maybe it's a lower risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests (high), low education (high), single living situation\u2014though not sure; joblessness (high), and mood issues (medium). So the overall prediction is high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Low Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, and only one job in the past year contribute to instability and higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes be protective if surrounded by supportive individuals, but without specific issues, this factor is considered low risk.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment or Economic Instability\", \"high\", \"Only held one job in the past year, which can lead to economic dependence and substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\"),\n    (\"Mood Issues or Depression\", \"medium\", \"Felt down mood and possible depression, though not using drugs, could indicate underlying issues contributing to risk.\"),\n    (\"Family History of Larger Household Size\", \"low\", \"Was in a household of four at a young age; family support can be protective unless there were significant family issues that carried over.
