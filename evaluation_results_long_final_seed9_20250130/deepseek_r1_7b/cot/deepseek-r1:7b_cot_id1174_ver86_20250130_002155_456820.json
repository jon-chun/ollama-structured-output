    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the recidivism risk of an 18-year-old Black male based on his history. He's been arrested four times with convictions, which is a strong indicator of past issues. His age might be a factor because younger individuals often have more responsibilities and support systems.\n\nHe's got a BMI around 145 lbs for someone his height, so he's underweight but that's not directly related to recidivism. He's single living alone without anyMarital status or family support, which could increase risk factors like substance abuse or instability.\n\nHis educational background is lacking\u2014he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Without education, he might face employment challenges leading to more criminal activity. His job history shows he only held one job recently; part-time or no job can affect his stability.\n\nNo drug use for four years is positive, but sometimes feeling low without any substances could suggest underlying issues like mental health problems that aren't being addressed. Since he's young and has a history of issues, his future behavior might be influenced by lack of support and environments conducive to learning or personal growth.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014past convictions, age, education, job status, living alone, no drug use but possible mental health issues\u2014he seems to have multiple risk points that could contribute to recidivism. So, I think the prediction is high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Previous Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old with a history of four arrests and convictions, which indicates a pattern of past criminal behavior that could influence future decisions.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation and Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and not being married may contribute to isolation or lack of support systems, potentially affecting stability and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Educational Background\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not currently enrolled in college could lead to limited opportunities and increase the risk of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Only holding one job during the past year may indicate instability, which is a known factor in recidivism but this alone does not strongly contribute to high risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years suggests self-discipline but feelings of low mood without substances could point to potential mental health issues that might require intervention but do not directly correlate with high risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing a household of four at a young age may have provided less supervision or support, potentially contributing to behavioral issues as an adult that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs and Feelings\", \"low\", \"Denying religious involvement might suggest a lack of guidance but feelings about personal experiences do not directly correlate with high risk without further context on their nature or impact.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
