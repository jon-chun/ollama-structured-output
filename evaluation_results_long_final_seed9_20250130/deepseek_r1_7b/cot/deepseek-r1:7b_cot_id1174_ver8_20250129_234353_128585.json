    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let me go through all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a red flag because more arrests usually mean a history of trouble, which can lead to more issues in the future.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. His height doesn't directly affect his risk, but combined with other factors like being a former addict might influence it indirectly. But since he hasn't used drugs for four years, maybe that factor isn't as strong now.\n\nLiving alone is a bit concerning because isolation can sometimes lead to emotional issues or substance abuse problems, which could increase his chances of reoffending.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Not completing education might mean he lacks the skills necessary for success after release, making him more likely to fall into similar behavior again.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability and increased stress, which could contribute to recidivism.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood are concerning. He felt so down recently that nothing could cheer him up. This might indicate underlying mental health issues or substance abuse problems, both of which are strong risk factors for re-arrest.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age. A larger family can sometimes provide more support and stability, but if he was part of a dysfunctional home, it might have contributed to his current issues.\n\nHis religious beliefs don't seem relevant here; perhaps that's why he feels that way about his circumstances.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable living situation, recent negative emotional state. These factors collectively suggest a high risk of reoffending within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four arrests with convictions, indicating past trouble which can lead to future issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to isolation leading to potential emotional or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma and not enrolled in college could result in skill deficits potentially leading to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"low\", \"Only held one job during the year, which might indicate financial instability and increased stress levels.\"),\n    (\"Recent Mood Issues\", \"high\", \"Has felt down recently with no cheers, suggesting possible mental health issues or substance abuse contributing to risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
