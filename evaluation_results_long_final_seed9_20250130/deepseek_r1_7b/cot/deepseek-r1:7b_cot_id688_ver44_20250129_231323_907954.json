    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the recidivism risk for a 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her race is White. I don't think race plays a significant role in recidivism when other factors are considered, so that's probably low weight.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's definitely a high risk factor because past convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHer height and weight might not be relevant here unless there's some context about her behavior related to those traits, which I don't have, so maybe medium or low? Wait, maybe it's just for physical presence, but since she has other factors, this one might be low.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, but being single doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there's a lack of support. I'm leaning towards medium because it's not the most significant factor on its own.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so this should be low weight.\n\nShe held one job recently. Employment can reduce recidivism as having a stable income and support system helps in reintegration, so medium weight.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed lately. Drug use is concerning because past use can lead to relapse or new offenses. High risk here because even if she's not feeling depressed now, past use is a problem.\n\nNo recent depression symptoms are positive, which might lower her risk slightly, so maybe medium weight for this factor.\n\nYoung household at age: Living with three others when young doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there were issues in the household. Since no info on that, perhaps low or medium? I'll go with medium as it's a neutral factor without specific info.\n\nBelief in God is personal and might not affect behavior much, so probably low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: High risk factors are the prior conviction and drug use. Medium factors include living alone and education. Low factors don't contribute much here. So overall, the risk seems high enough to predict a YES for rearrest within three years with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Criminal History\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use can lead to relapse or new offenses, contributing to high risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Having a job can reduce recidivism risks, but one recent job may not be sufficient.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk without additional context about household issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Higher education is associated with lower recidivism, reducing overall risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
