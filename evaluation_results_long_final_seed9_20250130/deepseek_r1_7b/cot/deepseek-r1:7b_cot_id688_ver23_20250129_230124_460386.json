    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one prior arrest and a conviction. That's a solid red flag because past convictions are a major indicator of recidivism. So that's high risk right there.\n\nHer age is 21, which is relatively young, but she's still making her way through life. However, since she already has a conviction, it suggests maybe she had some issues earlier on that might have affected her ability to reintegrate successfully now.\n\nShe identifies as White, and while race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, in this case, without more context about the neighborhood or specific circumstances, I'll assume it's not a significant factor here. So maybe medium risk related to race, but not sure if that impacts her much compared to other factors.\n\nShe is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Her height and weight don't immediately indicate anything concerning recidivism, so probably no direct impact on the risk assessment.\n\nNever married and living alone might affect her social support system. Living alone can sometimes mean she has fewer resources or help in case of emergencies, but again, without knowing more about her personal circumstances, it's hard to gauge how much that affects recidivism.\n\nShe completed associate/junior college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year program. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be low risk. Plus, she has one job, which suggests stability, further reducing the risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. I know that drug use can lead to other issues or substance abuse problems, which can increase recidivism if not addressed properly. However, since she's not feeling depressed now and is enrolled in college, it might indicate she's working on her mental health.\n\nHer background: At a young age, she lived with four people. That's a larger household, but unless there were significant issues within the family, that alone doesn't necessarily increase risk. Her belief in God could be a protective factor related to spirituality or moral guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: The main red flags are the prior conviction and the lack of significant support system. The education is positive, but her past drug use might suggest some underlying issues she's addressing now. I'm leaning towards medium risk because while there are a few mitigating factors like her education, there are also some concerns about her history that could resurface.\n\nSo, overall, considering all these points, I think the risk of rearrest is medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"Her presence of a prior arrest and conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone and Lack of Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, which can increase risk factors related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Her educational background and current enrollment in college are positive indicators that could mitigate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"While she has a history of drug use, she hasn't felt depressed recently, indicating possible self-mgmt or intention to address substance issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Experienced living with four people doesn't inherently indicate significant family dysfunction unless accompanied by other factors\"),\n    (\"Belief in God and Spiritual Factors\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can provide moral guidance and support, which may positively influence recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
