    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a risk assessment task for a 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step to determine the appropriate weight.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals generally have lower recidivism rates because they're still developing their decision-making skills and life experiences are limited. So that's low risk.\n\nShe identifies as White. While race can influence recidivism due to systemic factors like over-policing or socioeconomic disparities, she has only one prior arrest, so the weight here is low.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk unless they indicate physical health issues, but since she's in college and seems healthy, I'll consider them as neutral\u2014so no impact on risk factors.\n\nNever married living alone: Being single can be a protective factor because there might not be the same level of support or supervision. So this is low.\n\nEducation at associate level with ongoing college suggests some stability; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. Medium risk here.\n\nOne job in a year\u2014consistent employment typically reduces recidivism as it shows a stable life situation. Medium again.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially if recent or frequent, can be a risk factor. But since she hasn't felt depressed recently and it's only marijuana, the impact is medium.\n\nReligious involvement: If she believes in God, that might offer some support or guidance which could be protective. Low risk.\n\nYoung household at age 4\u2014small households often have more supervision, so this is low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are either neutral, protective, or slightly negative. The strongest risk comes from her drug use and perhaps being a young individual who might not have the life experience to avoid rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21, which generally indicates lower recidivism due to limited life experiences.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can influence recidivism, her single prior arrest suggests a low risk despite being White.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"neutral\", \"No direct bearing on recidivism; she is healthy and in college.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living alone as a never-married individual may offer some protective factors but not significant enough to change the risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"An associate degree with ongoing college suggests some stability, which could be a mitigating factor but not the strongest one.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"One job in a year indicates consistent employment, which is associated with lower recidivism but not the most significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (marijuana) without recent severe mental health episodes can still pose a moderate risk, depending on frequency and context.\"),\n    (\"Religious Involvement\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may offer some protective factors through spiritual support or guidance but is not a strong mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 4\", \"low\", \"Living with fewer family members can sometimes provide more supervision, contributing to lower risk.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
