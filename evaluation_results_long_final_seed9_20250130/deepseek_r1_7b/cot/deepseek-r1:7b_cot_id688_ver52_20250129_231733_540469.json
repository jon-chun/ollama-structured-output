    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. She's a 21-year-old female from White background with a criminal history. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her past convictions: she has one. That's a solid indicator of prior crime, which usually means higher risk. So that's a high weight because it directly relates to recidivism.\n\nAge is 21. Younger adults are often more likely to repeat offenses, so that's another high factor.\n\nShe's not married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems; maybe less supervision or help could increase risk. Also, she has only held one job recently. Unemployment or underemployment might mean she doesn't have the skills needed for stable employment in the future.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can impair judgment and lead to more impulsive behavior.\n\nHer belief in God might indicate a strong moral compass, but I'm not sure how that affects her risk directly. It could be either low or medium if it's about personal behavior versus external factors.\n\nShe was in a household of four at a young age. Larger households sometimes have more support networks, which could mitigate risk to some extent, but maybe she wasn't as supervised as in smaller families.\n\nPutting all these together, each factor seems significant. The presence of a criminal history and the current circumstances like unemployment or drug use are strong indicators. Her belief in God might not directly influence her behavior much, so it's probably a low weight.\n\nSo overall risk is high because most factors point towards higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor:\n\n1. **Convictions**: High - Having one prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n2. **Age**: High - Being 21 indicates she may be more prone to repeat offenses due to her age and experience level.\n3. **Drug Use**: High - Past marijuana use can lead to impulsive decisions and may contribute to future substance abuse issues.\n4. **Employment**: Medium - Unemployment or underemployment might limit opportunities for positive development, increasing risk.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the overall prediction is that she has a high risk of rearrest within three years due to her criminal history, age, drug use, and current circumstances.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"Having one prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Being 21 indicates she may be more prone to repeat offenses due to her age and experience level.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use can lead to impulsive decisions and may contribute to future substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment or underemployment might limit opportunities for positive development, increasing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
