    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. She's white, cisgendered, living alone, hasn't married yet. Her education is associate or junior college, she's currently in a 2-year college. She worked one job last year, uses marijuana but doesn't feel depressed recently. She lived in a household of four when young and believes in God.\n\nFirst, her age: 21. That's pretty young, so maybe less recidivism risk, but first offense could increase it. Being White might not be an issue here unless there's a systemic risk, which I don't know about.\n\nHer living situation is alone; that usually correlates with lower risk because she has support and fewer stressors. But being in a conviction might change things.\n\nEducation: She's got some post-secondary education but isn't completing it yet. Some studies suggest higher education can reduce recidivism, so maybe this factor lowers her risk.\n\nEmployment: One job is manageable, not too much to rely on. Maybe she has support from that job or other sources of income.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana is a mild substance; she's not using anything more harmful now. But past drug use might indicate a history of substance abuse which can increase risk in the future.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe her mental health isn't an issue at this time. But past behavior could be relevant if there's a history of mood disorders.\n\nHousehold size when young was 4; that's typical for her age group. Maybe not directly related to recidivism unless it indicates family issues or environment, but I don't have enough info on that.\n\nReligious belief: Believes in God, which might help with personal motivation towards good behavior, possibly lowering risk.\n\nPutting this together: Most factors seem favorable except the past drug use and the first offense. The lack of employment and education could be points against her. However, being alone and young are mitigating factors. I'm leaning towards low to medium risk. Maybe 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21, which may indicate lower recidivism risk due to being relatively young, though a first offense increases risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being White does not inherently increase risk without systemic issues known in the dataset.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone typically correlates with lower risk due to support and fewer stressors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Completed associate or junior college but currently enrolled, which may slightly increase risk compared to higher education but could reduce it based on findings from studies suggesting higher education reduces recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"One job held last year indicates some stability and support, though not a strong mitigating factor if other income sources are unavailable.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years; however, she hasn't felt depressed recently.
