    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male and predict his rearrest recidivism over three years. Let's break down each factor.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and convictions. That's pretty significant; multiple prior convictions are usually strong indicators of higher recidivism risk.\n\nHis age is 18, which might mean he's still developing, but it could also indicate he hasn't had much life experience to build good habits or skills.\n\nHe identifies as Black, which historically has been linked to systemic issues that might affect his treatment and opportunities, contributing to higher risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant here. Living alone is a factor; living with family can provide support and reduce stress, but he's an adult so maybe he's managing it well.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he has limited educational resources, which could affect his employability and ability to learn skills that might help in avoiding recidivism.\n\nHe's employed one job, which is okay but not a strong indicator. Drug use history of four years suggests he's been clean, which is positive, but the recent feelings of low mood are concerning\u2014he might be struggling mentally or experiencing some stressors.\n\nLiving with four people at a young age could have had both positive and negative impacts; it might have provided stability but also if there were issues within the household that affected him.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might influence his personal motivations and coping mechanisms, possibly leading to substance abuse or other behavioral issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, multiple prior convictions are high risk. Age 18 is moderate, Blackness adds high risk due to systemic issues. His education level is low, which is a significant risk factor. Employment is okay but not enough. Drug use history shows he's clean but recent mood issues add some uncertainty. Living with family and his belief in God don't directly contribute.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors point towards high risk for recidivism. The confidence level would be quite high because of the multiple prior convictions and other significant factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a criminal history with four arrests and convictions, which is strongly indicative of higher recidivism risk due to past failed attempts at rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"Youth Age (18 years old)\", \"moderate\", \"Age can be both a double-edged sword; while still developing, it may limit life experience that could contribute to positive behavior changes or skills development which might reduce recidivism risk but also presents challenges in personal growth and decision-making that could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Racial Identity (Black)\", \"high\", \"His racial identity of Black is associated with systemic issues such as overrepresentation in the criminal justice system, which can impact access to resources, treatment, and employment opportunities, all of which may contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (No HS diploma/GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education significantly impacts employability and ability to acquire skills that could aid in avoiding recidivism.
