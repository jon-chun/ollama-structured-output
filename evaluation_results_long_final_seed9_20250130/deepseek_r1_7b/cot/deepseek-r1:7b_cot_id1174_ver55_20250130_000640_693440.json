    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times with a conviction. That's a significant number; being in trouble multiple times can indicate underlying issues that might lead to more offenses or substance abuse problems.\n\nHe's Black, but I don't know if race plays a role here beyond systemic factors which aren't directly addressed. Maybe it's more about personal circumstances.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 145 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is for recidivism unless there's something about his physical health affecting his job or living situation, but nothing in the info suggests that.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be a red flag because it might mean he doesn't have support, which could contribute to substance abuse or unstable living conditions.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Not finishing school is a known risk factor for higher recidivism due to lack of skills and increased likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on drugs, lack of life skills, and living in poverty, all of which increase the chance of reoffending.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but felt down recently. While he's clean now, recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying mental health issues that could affect his stability or willingness to engage positively with society.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households often have different dynamics; maybe there was conflict or instability which could contribute to the individual's current issues.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he might be dealing with personal struggles or lack of faith, which can affect mental health and decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, no education, unemployment, living alone, and potential mental health issues. These factors are all high risk indicators. The recidivism prediction is definitely high.\n</think>\n\nThe individual exhibits several risk factors that collectively indicate a high likelihood of rearrest within three years. Key factors include multiple prior convictions, lack of educational background, recent joblessness, living situation alone, and potential mental health concerns. These elements combine to point towards significant recidivism risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests (4 times) with convictions, indicating possible underlying issues that may lead to more offenses or substance abuse problems.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma and GED, which can contribute to increased likelihood of engaging in risky behavior such as drug use or unemployment, both linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Having held only one job during the year may indicate unemployment, leading to dependency on substance abuse or other unstable behaviors that increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be a red flag for potential instability, which might contribute to living in adverse conditions that could lead to recidivism issues such as drug use or lack of supervision.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"low\", \"While he hasn't used drugs recently, feelings of low mood suggest possible underlying mental health issues that may affect his stability and willingness to engage positively with society, increasing the risk but not as directly as other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
