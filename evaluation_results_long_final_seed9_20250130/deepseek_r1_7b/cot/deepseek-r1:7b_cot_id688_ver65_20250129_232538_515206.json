    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. I need to evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young but not the youngest in the population. Maybe it doesn't heavily influence recidivism yet, so maybe low weight.\n\nShe identifies as White, which can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates due to less crime against whites historically, but I need more info on this factor's impact here.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. A single prior offense is significant\u2014recidivistic tendency is higher, so this might be medium weight because it's recent and only once.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism unless there's an association with other factors like health issues, which isn't indicated here.\n\nLiving alone might have some impact on stability, but without knowing her support network or living conditions in detail, maybe low weight.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education. Education level is usually linked to lower recidivism; higher education reduces risk, so this could be medium if she's still studying.\n\nEmployment history: only one job during the year. Unemployment can lead to higher recidivism, especially with long spells without work, but just one job might not have a big impact\u2014maybe low weight.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana). Drug abuse can increase recidivism, so this is medium importance because it's recent and only marijuana, which isn't as severe as other drugs.\n\nNo feelings of depression recently. Positive mental health could correlate with lower risk\u2014so maybe low weight here.\n\nYoung household size at 4 members might suggest she has some support, possibly reducing risk slightly\u2014maybe medium if it was larger or if she had issues before.\n\nBelief in God is a personal factor that doesn't directly impact recidivism but can influence her behavior; perhaps low weight as it's more internal than external factors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (medium), education (medium), job history (low), drug use (medium), household size (medium). The prediction leans towards high risk, so I'll say \"YES\" with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a single prior conviction, which increases the likelihood of recidivism as individuals with criminal history are more prone to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"She is currently enrolled in a 2-year college after completing associate/junior college, which generally correlates with lower recidivism risk compared to those without post-secondary education.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"She has held only one job during the past year; employment alone may not significantly reduce recidivism risk unless there's evidence of unemployment or long-term joblessness.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which is a known factor associated with increased recidivism risk compared to non-users.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"At a young age, she lived in a household of size 4, which might suggest some level of support but doesn't guarantee stability or reduced risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month; positive mental health can reduce recidivism risk compared to those with recent or prolonged mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
