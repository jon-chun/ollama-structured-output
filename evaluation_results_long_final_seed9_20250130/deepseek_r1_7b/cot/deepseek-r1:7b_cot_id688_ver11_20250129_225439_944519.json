    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger adults might be less likely to have significant life changes that could affect recidivism, but it's still early in her career, so maybe not a strong risk factor on its own.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, and being White might correlate with better outcomes, but this isn't enough information. I'll note this but keep it low weight because other factors likely dominate.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction. One prior offense is concerning, especially if it's a serious crime. However, since she's only 21, maybe the severity matters here.\n\nShe's 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs. Weight can influence legal proceedings and opportunities, but without knowing if it's an issue like substance abuse or health conditions, it's hard to assess. I'll mark this as low weight.\n\nDivorced or never married? She's living alone now, so no kids indicated. Single parenthood isn't mentioned, but she's an adult, so maybe lower risk here unless there are unspoken issues.\n\nShe has a high school education and is in college. College attendance is positive for better job prospects and higher earnings later, which usually reduces recidivism. So this should be low to medium.\n\nEmployed one job during the year \u2013 that's stable employment, which is good news. Medium weight because if she had more or better jobs, it would be high, but just one seems okay.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years.Marijuana isn't as harmful as other drugs, and she hasn't felt depressed recently. Maybe she's managing her use well, so this factor is low to medium negative if any impact at all.\n\nShe felt no depression over the past month. That\u2019s a positive sign for her mental health, which generally correlates with lower recidivism risk. Medium weight because it's not a frequent issue but still relevant.\n\nYouth living in a household of four. Sibling presence can sometimes offer support and reduce stress, so maybe this is slightly protective. It might be low to medium positive if there were issues at home before, but since she's living with others without any negative outcomes mentioned, it's neutral.\n\nReligion involved \u2013 she believes God has some influence over her life. Religious factors often have protective effects, especially in certain communities, so that could be a small positive factor, maybe low weight.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest and prior convictions are the main risk factors here. Even though she has good education, employment, and no recent issues like depression or drug use (except marijuana), her past conviction is significant. She's young, but other factors might offset that. Since she has one prior arrest, which could lead to higher recidivism rates, I\u2019d lean towards a low confidence of high risk.\n\nWait, but the user asked for relative weight on each factor before predicting. So maybe I should assess each as:\n\nAge: Low\nRace: Low\nArrests: Medium (one conviction)\nHeight/Weight: Low\nMarital Status: Medium (living alone; though she's 21 so perhaps less impact)\nEducation: Medium (high school and in college, which is positive but not high risk)\nEmployment: Medium (one job, but could be low if it was unstable)\nDrug use: Low to Medium Negative (marijuana use without severe issues)\nMental health: Medium Positive\nYouth household size: Low to Medium Neutral\nReligion: Low Positive\n\nWait, the previous analysis thought about each factor's weight and concluded a 30% confidence of high risk. Maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nBut in this case, considering her age, good education, stable employment, no recent mental health issues, and small household, while having one prior arrest which could increase risk, but overall, it might be low to medium. So perhaps the prediction is \"NO\" with confidence around 30%.\n\nI think I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 21 may indicate stability and reduced life changes which could mitigate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While being White may correlate with better outcomes, other factors likely dominate here.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest is a concern but not definitive without context of severity or nature of offense\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Her height and weight don't indicate significant issues unless health conditions are present which aren't mentioned\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 21, though an adult, may have implications but doesn't directly correlate with risk without additional info\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school and college enrollment suggest positive prospects reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"One job is stable; more would be better but stability is noted\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low to medium negative\", \"Marijuana use with no recent depression suggests she's managing well, mitigating risk\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium positive\", \"No recent depression indicates good mental health, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"Youth Household Size\", \"neutral\", \"Living in a household of four may offer support without specific issues mentioned\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"low positive\", \"Belief in God may offer protective effects but varies by community and individual circumstances\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
