    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female rearresting within three years. Let me break down all her factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White. Racial factors can sometimes influence recidivism rates, but without specific data linking race to her personal circumstances, it's hard to assign a weight here. I'll go with low.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction, so that's a moderate risk factor. Medium weight makes sense because it's a clear offense history but not the most severe or recent.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and she weighs 163 lbs. Weight can be an indicator of physical health, but without data on BMI categories, I'll consider this low risk as the numbers are within normal ranges.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support networks, so maybe a bit higher risk than others, but since it's not related to substance use or criminal history, perhaps medium.\n\nEducation: associate degree completed and currently in college. Higher education is usually protective, so this should be low.\n\nEmployment: she held one job last year. Employment generally reduces recidivism, so another low factor.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. The recent negative mood might indicate a possible abstinence or less severe use, which could lower the risk. So maybe medium.\n\nHousehold size at a young age was 4. Larger households can offer more support, so this is low.\n\nHer belief in God: spirituality can provide support and reduce stress, so another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are on the lower side, but her drug use ( marijuana) might be a point to consider. However, since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe that mitigates some risk. \n\nI'm leaning towards low risk overall because there's no strong indicators of a high risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Racial factors can influence recidivism rates but without specific data linking her race to personal circumstances, it's hard to assign a weight here.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Moderate risk due to one prior arrest and conviction but not severe or recent.\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight within normal ranges do not indicate significant health issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, though not related to substance use or criminal history, could imply some isolation risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Higher education usually protective with completed associate degree and enrolled in college.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Employed one job last year which reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana recently but hasn't felt depressed, suggesting possible abstinence or less severe use.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of four, implying some support from others.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes in God which can provide support and reduce stress.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
