    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment case for a 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step to determine the relative weight.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which isn't too old, but she's still quite young, so maybe that's not a significant factor here. She has a White racial identifier; however, race can influence recidivism rates based on societal and systemic factors, so I'll give it a medium weight.\n\nShe has one arrest and one conviction, so past criminal history is present. This could indicate some underlying issues, but since she's only been convicted once, maybe the risk isn't too high yet. Medium weight seems appropriate here.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. Weight doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless it's an indicator of other factors, which it might not be in this context. So low weight.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can affect mental health and social support, but since she's not experiencing depression recently, maybe that offsets some risk. Medium weight here.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a associate or junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year program. College attendance is generally protective against recidivism, so low weight for this factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment history can be positive if stable, but having only one job might indicate some instability. Medium weight because it's not a strong positive or negative indicator yet.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning for recidivism risk, especially since she's been convicted before. High weight due to drug history and potential triggers.\n\nShe feels that God has something to do with her personal events, which suggests a possible lack of free will or responsibility. This could be an indicator of higher risk behavior or emotional issues, so high weight here as well.\n\nPutting it all together: The most concerning factors are the drug use (high) and her belief in divine influence (high). These two significant factors combined should lead to a high risk prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21, which is relatively young but not directly linked to recidivism risk without considering other factors.\"),\n    (\"Racial Background\", \"medium\", \"Racial identity can influence recidivism rates based on societal and systemic factors, so it has a moderate weight in the prediction model.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest and one conviction.
