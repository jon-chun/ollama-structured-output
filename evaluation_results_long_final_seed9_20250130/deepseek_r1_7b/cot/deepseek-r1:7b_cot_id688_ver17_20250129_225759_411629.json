    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young. Generally, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates due to fewer life experiences and potential impulsive decisions. But since she's completing her education at the associate level and attending college, that could mitigate some factors related to lack of stability or education.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. A single prior offense can significantly increase risk because it indicates past behavior that might recur. However, her current employment status\u2014she's only worked one job in a year\u2014isn't the best, which might suggest she could face unemployment issues leading to substance use or other problems again.\n\nHer weight is 163 lbs at 6'1\", which isn't too extreme but not particularly indicative on its own. Her living situation is living alone, which can be isolating and potentially increase stress, especially if she's experienced substance use (marijuana) in the past four years. She feels no depression now, so maybe that isolation has changed for the better.\n\nShe's never married and identifies as White. There isn't much information here to assess any potential racial or familial factors, which might play a role but aren't evident from this data.\n\nUsing drugs (marijuana) in the past four years is concerning because substance use can impair judgment, lead to risky behaviors, and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior again. Her lack of recent depression might suggest she's coping better emotionally now, but substance use can have long-term mental health consequences.\n\nHer household size at a young age was 4, which doesn't directly relate to her current situation, so I'll note that it's not a significant factor here.\n\nShe believes in God and sees some divine influence on her life. This could be a protective factor against substance abuse or other negative behaviors if she's using religion as an avenue for self-control.\n\nPutting this all together: The prior arrest is a high risk because of the past behavior, but her education and current job experience might lower it somewhat. However, substance use (marijuana) is a red flag indicating potential relapse or continued drug use, which could lead to more offenses. Her living alone with no depression now might be a positive sign in terms of mental health, but the past drug use and possible isolation are still concerning.\n\nI think her overall risk is medium because while there are mitigating factors like education and current job experience, the presence of substance use and prior arrest means she's not low risk. Her living situation doesn't seem to be causing significant issues now, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk than I initially thought but not as high as high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single prior arrest increases the risk of recidivism due to past behavior that may reoccur.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Only one job in a year could indicate potential instability, but without further information on job security or earnings, it's considered low risk.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use can impair judgment and lead to risky behaviors, increasing the likelihood of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone with No Depression\", \"low\", \"Living alone may not necessarily be harmful if stress levels are managed, though it could contribute to isolation leading to substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Attainment\", \"low\", \"Current education level suggests potential for better opportunities and reduced risk associated with lack of education.\");\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
