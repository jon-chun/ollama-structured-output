    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 18-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times with convictions, which is a significant factor because more prior offenses usually mean higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's only 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I don't know if his weight or height directly contributes to recidivism unless there's something about how he presents himself socially, but with no info on that, it's probably a low factor here.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Living alone can lead to isolation, which might increase stress and substance use, both of which are risk factors. So maybe medium weight.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he has less education, which ties into lower socioeconomic status. Lower income areas often have higher crime rates and recidivism, so that's another medium factor.\n\nHe held only one job in the past year. Unemployment for a long time can lead to dependency on substance abuse as a coping mechanism. So maybe high risk because of limited opportunities and possible drug use.\n\nNo recent drug use but had bad mood recently. If he's feeling down, it could affect his motivation or willingness to engage with rehabilitation programs, making him more likely to relapse.\n\nYoung age at 18 suggests he might still be in school, which is a positive for getting better education and job opportunities. But since he has four prior arrests, that's probably a stronger negative factor here.\n\nPast household size of four: growing up in a larger family could mean less support or more stress, contributing to substance abuse issues. So medium weight.\n\nBelieving in God doesn't influence events directly but might affect his mindset. If he doesn't see a higher power as influencing his decisions, it's probably a low factor unless there are other issues related to religion that aren't mentioned.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrests (high), limited education (medium), living alone (medium), unemployment (high due to only one job), drug use history (low since he hasn't used recently but felt bad), household size (medium), and no religious influence (low). The strongest factors are the prior arrests, unemployment, and maybe the living situation.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of multiple strong risk factors. Maybe 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests (4) which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and contribute to substance use issues, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lead to isolation and increased stress, potentially affecting mental health and substance use.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Only held one job in the past year; limited income sources and potential dependency on substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use but felt down recently; however, this is mitigated by lack of recent incidents but may indicate previous issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"medium\", \"Young household size (4) could contribute to stress or instability that may relate to substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Does not believe in God and this does not directly influence personal decisions related to substance use or recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
