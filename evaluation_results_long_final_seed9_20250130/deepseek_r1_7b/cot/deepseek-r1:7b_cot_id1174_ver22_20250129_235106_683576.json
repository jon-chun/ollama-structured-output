    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a risk factor rating for this 18-year-old male. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a high number of prior convictions, which definitely increases the risk of recidivism. Prior convictions are usually strong indicators because they show a history of breaking laws again.\n\nHe's only 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I don't think his stature or weight directly affects recidivism unless it relates to other factors like substance use, but he hasn't used drugs in the past four years. So maybe that's not a big factor here.\n\nHe's living alone, which could mean less support system around him. Being in a group can sometimes provide help and reduce stress, so living alone might increase his risk of mental health issues flaring up.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he's likely facing educational challenges. Without education, he might have fewer opportunities for positive development or job stability, which could contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Job instability can lead to financial stress and a lack of skills, which are often linked to reoffending.\n\nHe felt really down in the past month but didn't use drugs. That could indicate underlying mental health issues that aren't being addressed, putting him at risk if these feelings don't improve or get managed.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with four people. A larger household can sometimes offer more support and stability, so maybe this isn't as bad as it seems, but I should keep it in mind.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life is something to consider. If spirituality plays a big role for him, then that might not be much of an issue. But if he's mentally unstable or has other issues, that could still affect recidivism rates.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are high (high risk), living alone adds some risk, lack of education is medium, one job is low but maybe contributes to stress, and his mental state isn't clear. The overall prediction would lean towards high risk because of the prior convictions and possible underlying issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Each prior conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending.
