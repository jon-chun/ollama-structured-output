    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this 21-year-old female rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which isn't too old but she's still relatively young. Being a minor might mean she has fewer life experiences and responsibilities, so maybe lower risk? But since she has prior convictions, that should weigh more heavily.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there can be disparities in the criminal justice system based on race, but this is just one factor among many. It doesn't determine her risk directly unless there's a systemic issue we're considering here.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. Re-arrest rates tend to be higher for those with prior convictions, especially if they're re-entering the system after incarceration or supervision.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and she weighs 163 lbs. These are physical characteristics that might relate to her ability to hold steady jobs or contribute to substance use, but without more info, it's hard to assess. Maybe not a strong factor on its own.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which could increase risk factors like drug use or anxiety, especially if she feels lonely despite not being depressed recently.\n\nShe has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism because of better job prospects and life skills. So this should be a mitigating factor.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. That's a bit concerning because unemployment or underemployment can increase risk, especially if she doesn't have strong ties to her current situation. Maybe she's struggling or has inconsistent work.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only). Past drug use is a red flag. Even if it's marijuana, it can lead to other substance use issues, which might affect her stability and likelihood of reoffending.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month. This seems positive because depression is linked to higher recidivism rates when it leads to substance abuse or self-harm. If she's not depressed now, that's a good sign for future behavior.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes provide more support and stability, which might help reduce risk factors like drug use or neglect. However, if there were issues in those households, it could be problematic.\n\nBelieving in God has something to do with her personal events. That's a positive factor as it suggests she has some form of mental health support, which can aid in staying sober and managing any underlying issues.\n\nPutting this all together: She has prior convictions (high risk), low education relative to others her age (but mitigated by her current college enrollment), unemployment or underemployment (medium), past drug use (high), lack of marriage and living alone (maybe medium), height/weight don't seem directly related, but she's young so perhaps low.\n\nThe high prior conviction and recent drug use would likely pull the prediction towards a higher risk. However, her education is mitigating some factors. The presence of prior convictions might increase the risk enough that it outweighs other positive factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a conviction history which can lead to increased re-arrest rates.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment/Underemployment\", \"medium\", \"Employment status is a mitigating factor, but given she only held one job in the past year, it raises concerns about stability and support system effectiveness.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana) can lead to substance abuse issues which may affect her ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age without a family support network could contribute to isolation, but the absence of recent depression suggests she has mechanisms in place to manage stress and emotional well-being.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
