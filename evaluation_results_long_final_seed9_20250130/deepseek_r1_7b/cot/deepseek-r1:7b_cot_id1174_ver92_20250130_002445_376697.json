    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Black male. He's been arrested four times and convicted. That's a high number of prior convictions, which is definitely a red flag.\n\nHis age being 18 doesn't immediately strike me as a risk factor or protective one. He's still developing socially, so maybe some factors related to immaturity could play a role, but it's not the most significant here.\n\nHe's currently living alone and never married. Living at home can sometimes mean more dependency on family, which might be protective, but without knowing his circumstances better, it's hard to say. Being single doesn't directly correlate with higher rearrest rates unless there are other underlying issues.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is concerning because education levels often correlate with lower recidivism rates. Without a diploma, he might face barriers to employment and housing, increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's only held one job in the past year, which suggests limited income stability and opportunities for upward mobility. Unemployment can lead to dependency on social services, which might contribute to criminal behavior again.\n\nNot using drugs in the past four years is a positive sign. Drug use is often linked to higher recidivism rates because of the risks involved in street activities or the time spent in substance abuse treatment programs.\n\nHe felt down recently and couldn't find cheer, which could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health problems can be a significant risk factor for reoffending as they might impede one's ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with four people, so that's quite a large household. Large households are generally protective because there are more family members who can offer support and help in times of need, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could indicate some level of spirituality or lack thereof, but it's not directly tied to recidivism unless he has a history of using religion as a coping mechanism for stress, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are high (high risk), limited education and employment (medium to high risk), living alone (moderate risk), recent mental health issues (low to medium risk depending on context), and no drug use but past depression-like feelings (low to medium). The household size is protective, which might lower the overall risk a bit.\n\nConsidering all factors, his risk of rearrest seems fairly high. I'd rate this person as having a high risk of recidivism over three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested four times and convicted significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending as it demonstrates a history of criminal behavior and potential for relapse.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can impede opportunities for stable employment and housing, which are crucial for reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Only holding one job in the past year may indicate limited income stability and opportunities for upward mobility, which could contribute to reoffending if circumstances change.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"low\", \"Recent feelings of low mood might suggest potential mental health issues that can sometimes be addressed with support, potentially reducing risk if managed effectively.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age and currently living alone may offer some protective factors but also could isolate him from support networks which are crucial for avoiding criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
