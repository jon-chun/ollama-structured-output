    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male having rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: four arrests and a conviction. That's a significant red flag. Recidivistic tendency is high here because of past mistakes.\n\nHis age at 18 is quite young, which might suggest he was influenced by the environment or other factors that could be transitory. But it's still concerning as younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe identifies as Black, and unfortunately, there are systemic issues that can lead to under-policing and over-incrimination, especially for minority groups. This increases risk despite similar circumstances in other areas.\n\nWeight: 5'10\"/145 lbs is on the lower end but not extremely thin or imposing. No indication of physical health issues here.\n\nMarital status\u2014he's living alone with no spouse, which could mean he relies solely on himself, possibly leading to isolation and increased risk of substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. This lack of education can limit opportunities, contribute to unstable situations, and may correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nEmployment: Only one job in the past year might indicate some instability if he's been unemployed longer than that. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other activities that could cause relapse.\n\nNo recent drug use for four years is positive\u2014it shows he's recovered from any substance issues, which is a good sign for recidivism.\n\nHe felt down during the past month without any solace\u2014indicating potential mental health issues. Without professional help, this could escalate into further issues contributing to risk.\n\nHousehold size at 4 suggests a stable living situation initially but now he's alone. Changing household circumstances can lead to stress and instability, especially if there are underlying issues like financial strain or neglect.\n\nNo religious affiliation\u2014this might contribute to feelings of isolation or existential despair, which could affect his mental health and willingness to seek help, potentially leading to more risk.\n\nPutting it all together: High criminal history, age considerations, systemic issues affecting Black individuals, living alone, limited education, low employment, recent positive mental health status (no drugs), past negative emotions without support, household changes, and lack of religious affiliation. All these factors point towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"The individual has four arrests and one conviction, indicating a significant criminal history that suggests a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age at arrest\", \"medium\", \"Arrested at 18, which is relatively early in life.
