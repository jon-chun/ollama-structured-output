    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. I need to go through each factor step by step and assign a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014and then predict her rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, age: she's 21. Young adults can be more impulsive and have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their decision-making skills. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nEthnicity is White\u2014doesn't directly affect risk unless there are systemic issues, but in many cases, White individuals might not face as much stigma, so maybe lower relative impact here compared to other factors.\n\nConviction: she has one, which suggests some past legal trouble. Convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending, so that's a high factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 1 inch is tall, but weight is 163 lbs for her height\u2014maybe a bit skinny? Not sure if that affects risk, maybe more about other factors like substance use.\n\nLiving alone: yes, living with family can provide support. Living alone might increase exposure to stressors or social isolation, which could be a medium factor.\n\nEducation: associate/junior college completed and currently in 2-year college. Some education usually reduces recidivism, but if she's still studying, maybe she's motivated, so perhaps lower risk from education here.\n\nEmployment: only one job during the year. Maybe she's between jobs or underemployed. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance use for stress relief, which could be a medium factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in past four years. Drug use is linked to higher recidivism because of potential substance abuse issues and possible paraphernalia use leading to more crimes. That's high risk.\n\nMental health: no depression in the past month. Positive mental state might reduce risk, but if she has underlying issues not addressed, it could be a medium factor. Wait, she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe lower risk here.\n\nHousehold size at young age: four people\u2014so maybe family support or shared stress? Maybe that's a low to medium factor depending on dynamics.\n\nGod involvement: she believes in God affecting her life. Religious beliefs can offer support but might also impose strict values which could conflict with other aspects of her life, potentially increasing risk if there are underlying issues like addiction or neglect.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk factors include age, prior conviction, drug use. Medium ones: living alone, education, employment. Low: household size at young age and God involvement (if not leading to neglect).\n\nHer high risk factors\u2014age, prior conviction, drug use\u2014are significant contributors to recidivism. The medium factors might temper the prediction a bit, but the main issues are still there.\n\nSo overall, considering the strong indicators of risk despite some mitigating factors, I'd predict a YES to rearrest within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young adults can be more impulsive and have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals might not face as much stigma, so maybe lower relative impact compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Not sure if that affects risk; maybe more about other factors like substance use.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might increase exposure to stressors or social isolation which could be a medium factor\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Some education usually reduces recidivism, but if she's still studying, maybe she's motivated so perhaps lower risk from education here\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance use for stress relief which could be a medium factor\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is linked to higher recidivism because of potential substance abuse issues and possible paraphernalia use leading to more crimes.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"She hasn't felt depressed recently so maybe lower risk here but if she has underlying issues not addressed it could be a medium factor\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Maybe family support or shared stress?
