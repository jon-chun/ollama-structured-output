    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help this user who is a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about an 18-year-old male with various risk factors, and they want me to assign each factor a relative weight (low, medium, high) before predicting the 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, I'll start by reading through all the details carefully. The person is Black, 18 years old, male, arrested four times, convicted once. His height and weight are given but don't seem immediately relevant unless there's a reason to consider his physical health as a risk factor, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, no high school diploma or GED, attending college? No, he's not enrolled. He's held one job in the past year. Drug use: no drugs in the past four years, but sometimes felt down during the last month. At a young age, lived with four people. Believes God has nothing to do with his personal life.\n\nNow, I need to think about each of these factors and how they might contribute to recidivism risk.\n\n1. **Number of prior arrests**: Four times. More prior convictions typically indicate higher risk because of past behavior and possible substance abuse issues. So this is a high risk factor.\n\n2. **Education level**: No diploma or GED, not attending college. Lack of education can lead to lower self-esteem, substance abuse, and unemployment, all contributing to recidivism. High risk.\n\n3. **Employment status**: Held one job recently. Some jobs might provide stability, but if it's temporary, it could indicate low motivation. However, since he has no high school diploma, maybe looking for a better opportunity is part of his situation. Medium risk? Maybe medium because the job alone isn't enough to predict future issues.\n\n4. **Drug use**: No recent drug use in four years, but sometimes felt down. If feeling down could indicate substance abuse issues without using drugs, that's concerning. Medium or low?\n\n5. **Living situation**: Alone at 18 with no family around. Living alone can be isolating and might lead to emotional distress if he's struggling mentally. High risk because isolation often correlates with behavioral problems.\n\n6. **Past household size**: At a young age, lived with four people. Small family sizes sometimes mean more supervision or less support, but at 18, maybe that's leading to his current issues. Medium-high? Could be high if he was mistreated or caused problems in the past.\n\n7. **Belief in God**: Doesn't see any role for God in his life. Some studies suggest religion can act as a protective factor against recidivism by providing moral guidance and support, but here it's explicitly not part of his life. Low risk because lack of religious support might correlate with other negative factors.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrests (high), education (high), living alone (high), maybe drug use is low unless there's a hidden issue. Employment status medium. Belief in God low.\n\nSo the high factors are four, which would significantly increase the risk prediction. The confidence level would be around 75% because most factors point towards high risk except for the lack of religious involvement and no recent drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests indicate higher recidivism risk due to past behavior patterns and potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education, including no diploma or GED, can lead to lower self-esteem and unemployment, increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone at a young age with no family support may contribute to isolation and emotional distress, potentially leading to behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held one job recently; however, not attending college or having a diploma suggests possible low motivation or seeking better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use in the past four years, though feelings of depression may indicate potential substance abuse concerns outside of drug use.\"), \n    (\"past_household_size\", \"medium-high\", \"Living with four people at a young age might suggest family issues or lack of supervision, contributing to behavioral problems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
