    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger adults are often seen as less experienced, which might mean lower recidivism. But also, they can be more enthusiastic about change, so that's a bit conflicting.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there have been studies suggesting racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but since she has only one prior arrest and is now enrolled in college, her personal factors are probably more significant than her race alone.\n\nMarried or living with family? She's never married and lives alone, which might indicate less stressors at home. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor as it reduces dependency on others who could offer support or intervene if needed.\n\nEthnicity is White; however, without knowing any specific prior issues related to her race, this factor might not heavily influence the risk right now.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in a 2-year program. Higher education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability, which usually reduces recidivism risk.\n\nShe's held one job recently. Having some income means she might be more motivated to change her behavior or seek help if needed.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is legal and less severe than say, harder drugs, so maybe it doesn't have a huge impact unless it's leading to other issues like substance abuse disorders.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which suggests she's in a relatively positive mental state. That could be protective against recidivism.\n\nYounger household size at age: She lived with four people when young. A larger support network can provide more help if something goes wrong, so that's a positive factor.\n\nBelieves God is involved in her life. Religious beliefs often offer strong moral guidance and support systems, which might help maintain stability.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors seem to lean towards low risk. The key protective factors like age, education, living alone, not feeling depressed, and having a positive attitude counterbalance any potential risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger adults are often seen as less experienced, which might mean lower recidivism.
