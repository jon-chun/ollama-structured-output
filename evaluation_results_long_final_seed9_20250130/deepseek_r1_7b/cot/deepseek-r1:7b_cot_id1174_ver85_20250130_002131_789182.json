    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's a significant criminal record, which definitely raises his risk. Four arrests in such a short age mean he's had some trouble before, so that's high risk.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and he weighs 145 lbs. I don't know if that affects his risk directly, but maybe it could relate to other factors like physical health or substance use. But since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, maybe his weight isn't a problem here.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which might mean he doesn't have support around him, increasing chances of substance abuse issues or not accessing help when needed. So that could be a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is concerning because education can influence recidivism rates. Without education, he might face challenges in finding stable employment and could turn to other negative activities. That's a high risk factor.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Joblessness often leads to dependency issues, which can escalate into substance abuse or other risky behaviors. This is another high factor.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood for some months might indicate potential substance use issues or mental health problems. Substance abuse can definitely lead to more criminal behavior, so this is medium-high risk.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four could mean he's not getting the attention he needs or might have learned bad coping mechanisms. This environment might contribute to his current issues and future behavior. Medium-high risk.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might affect his motivation towards positive behaviors. If religion plays a role in supporting him, this could be a red flag for potential self-harm or risky decisions. That's medium-high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: four arrests, no education, single living, one job, mood issues, and family background. All these points point towards high risk. So I'm confident that the prediction is YES with an 85% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests indicate a history of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of future involvement in the legal system and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED suggests potential challenges in obtaining employment and managing personal responsibilities, which can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Employing only one job during the year may indicate difficulty finding stable employment, leading to dependency issues and increased risk of engaging in risky activities.\"), \n    (\"Mood swings\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for some months could suggest potential substance use issues or mental health concerns that may contribute to criminal behavior if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Family environment\", \"medium\", \"Living alone in a household of four might imply inadequate support and coping mechanisms, which can influence decision-making and risk-taking behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
