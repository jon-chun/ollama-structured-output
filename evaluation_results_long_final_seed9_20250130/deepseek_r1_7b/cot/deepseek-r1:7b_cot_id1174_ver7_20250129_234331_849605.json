He's been arrested four times and convicted before, which is a strong indicator that he has problematic behaviors. His age makes him more prone to substance abuse or behavioral issues.\n\nHe's got a height of 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. I wonder if his weight could be contributing to other issues like addiction or health problems, but there's no direct information about that here. Maybe he's struggling with something else related to his weight, but without info on health issues, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's living alone, which can isolate him and might contribute to substance abuse or lack of support system. His educational background is limited\u2014he hasn't completed high school or has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could mean he's seeking help but not getting the resources he needs. His job situation\u2014only one job over the past year\u2014might be unstable, leading him to turn to other substances for stress.\n\nHe doesn't use drugs in the past four years, so that's a positive. However, his emotional state is negative\u2014he feels down most of the time and can't find cheer. This could lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism or self-harm behaviors, which are serious risks.\n\nLiving with four people at a young age might have had a significant impact on his behavior. It could create dependency issues or family dysfunction, which are known risk factors for recidivism. His lack of belief in God could influence his behavior and decision-making; maybe he's more likely to engage in risky activities without religious guidance.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests, educational challenges, living alone, emotional distress, possible substance use, and a family history that might have contributed to his issues. These factors point towards high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple arrest history\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and convictions indicate a history of problematic behavior which could lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can isolate an individual, potentially leading to substance abuse or behavioral issues as coping mechanisms.\"),\n    (\"emotional distress\", \"high\", \"Frequent feelings of depression without any indication of drug use suggest potential substance abuse or self-harm behaviors, which are serious risks.\"),\n    (\"poor educational background\", \"medium\", \"Limited education and lack of college enrollment may result in unstable job situations or increased riskSeeking support for substance issues could help prevent further offenses but may also contribute to recidivism if not addressed.'),\n    (\"unstable job situation\", \"low\", \"Only one job over the past year suggests potential job insecurity, which might lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism rather than an indication of high risk itself.\"),\n    (\"family history at young age\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of four at a young age can indicate family dysfunction or dependency issues that may contribute to criminal behavior and recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
