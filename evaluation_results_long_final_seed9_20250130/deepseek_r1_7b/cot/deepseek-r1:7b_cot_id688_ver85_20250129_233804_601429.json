    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might be a positive sign since she's relatively young, but she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That seems concerning because prior convictions can increase future recidivism rates. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe's White, but I'm not sure how that plays into recidivism without more context. Maybe race doesn't directly influence her personal risk here, so this might be low or medium. Since she's never been married and living alone, she might have fewer social supports, which could contribute to higher risk. But I don't know if being single is a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHer height and weight aren't relevant factors for recidivism, so those can be considered low impact. She has no dependents because she's living alone with no children or other family members. That might mean she has less supervision, which could increase the risk of relapse after incarceration.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in a 2-year program. Education can be a mitigating factor if she's completing her studies, but it also depends on how much she values her degree and whether she plans to use it for successful reintegration. Since she's enrolled, maybe that's a positive sign.\n\nShe held one job during the year; however, job stability isn't provided. If she was employed full-time or had a meaningful role, that could be good, but if it was part-time or unstable, that might have negative implications. I don't have enough info on this factor.\n\nHer drug use history is only marijuana in the past four years, which is less severe than other drug uses. Since she's never felt depressed recently, maybe she's managing her mental health better after incarceration, which could be a positive indicator. But prior substance abuse can still pose risks if not addressed.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age, which might have provided some support but could also indicate living with people who might not have been supportive or who contributed to her past issues. Now living alone, she's probably more isolated, increasing the risk of relapse.\n\nHer religious belief in God might offer some support and positivity, which is a mitigating factor. However, personal beliefs don't directly correlate with criminal behavior after release unless there's evidence of her using that belief as a tool to avoid trouble.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), living alone (medium), drug use (low), age (low). The other factors are neutral or low impact. So overall, considering the prior offense and isolation, I'd lean towards high risk but might temper it slightly with the positive religious factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of future recidivism due to past legal consequences.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support and increase isolation, which can contribute to higher risk factors after release.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may offer some positive influence, but it does not directly correlate with reduced recidivism risk without evidence of its use as a tool for avoiding trouble.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
