    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might be a positive indicator since she's relatively young. But she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a negative sign because prior convictions are strong predictors of future crimes.\n\nShe's White, but I don't think race plays a significant role in this case beyond what's already noted.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and weight 163 lbs\u2014nothing unusual here. She's living alone with no dependents, which might suggest she's responsible, but being single doesn't directly correlate to lower recidivism unless there are other factors like substance use.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in a 2-year college. Education can sometimes reduce recidivism if it's leading to better job opportunities, but if she's not employed or hasn't seen improvement, that could be a factor.\n\nShe held one job recently. Maybe she's looking for more stable employment now, which might be a positive sign.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to unstable behavior and impulsive decisions that might contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While some substance users might experience depression as part of their cycle, she's not feeling it now. That could be a positive indicator for her mental health stability.\n\nYoung household size: At a young age, she lived with three other people. This might indicate she didn't have a lot of supervision or support, which could contribute to risky behavior earlier on.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her life. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but without knowing specifics about how that affects her actions, it's hard to say if that's positive or negative.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest and conviction is a high risk factor because past behavior tends to repeat. Drug use is another strong indicator of current risky tendencies. The other factors don't necessarily outweigh these two negatives. So, I'd lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Her age is 21 years old and has a criminal history with one prior arrest and conviction which are strong indicators of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor for substance abuse and potential behavioral issues leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She is currently enrolled in college but may not have seen significant improvement or stable employment, which could be a mitigating factor if she's actively seeking better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year might indicate some stability, but it's important to assess her current job performance and whether it leads to consistent behavior changes.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no dependents suggests she may have some level of responsibility, though this doesn't directly correlate with lower recidivism without additional context about her living arrangements or support network.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, but substance use often comes with mental health challenges which can influence behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living with three people at a young age might have contributed to her risky behavior earlier on, indicating potential for similar patterns as she grows older.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God doesn't directly indicate positive or negative behavior but could influence decision-making and life choices which may not be directly linked to substance abuse or recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
