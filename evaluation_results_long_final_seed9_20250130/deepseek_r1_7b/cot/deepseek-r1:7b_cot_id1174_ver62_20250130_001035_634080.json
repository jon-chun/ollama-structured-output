    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the recidivism risk for a 18-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted. He's 5'10\", weighs 145 lbs, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, held one job recently. No drug use in the past four years but felt down sometimes. At age 18, lived with four people. Believes God has nothing to do with his life.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor:\n\nAge: He's only 18 and has a history of multiple arrests (4). Young age can be both a risk because of inexperience but also maybe more motived to change since he's still developing. The fact that he's 5'10\" and 145 lbs might indicate health issues or perhaps substance use, which could contribute.\n\nEducation: He has no diploma or GED. Lack of education is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it reduces opportunities for positive development and self-employment.\n\nMarital Status: He's never married and living alone. Living with family can provide support that might help prevent isolation, but since he lives alone, maybe he feels lonely which could be a stressor or cause substance use as mentioned.\n\nEmployment: Only held one job recently, so maybe has limited skills or is struggling to find stable employment. Unemployment can lead to dependency and further criminal behavior.\n\nDrug Use: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years but sometimes felt low mood. While he's clean now, past drug use could be a risk if he relapsed, which might have contributed to his previous arrests.\n\nLiving Arrangement at 18: Household size of four can provide support and stability, so maybe not as high a risk here. However, living with others doesn't necessarily correlate with lower risk; it's more about the dynamics within the household.\n\nBelief in God: If he doesn't believe in God having an effect on his life, he might have different motivations for criminal behavior or substance use, which could be harder to address as he gets older and becomes more independent.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nHigh risk factors:\n- Multiple arrests (4) \u2192 high\n- Lack of education \u2192 high\n- Living alone at 18 \u2192 medium? Since household size was four when he was 18 but now lives alone, maybe the transition to living alone could be a risk.\n- Employed one job recently, but maybe not stable or enough skills. Could also indicate potential for more dependence on work as a crutch if things go south.\n\nMedium risk factors:\n- Belief in God \u2192 medium? If he doesn't see the impact of God, it might explain other motivations rather than contributing directly to recidivism.\n- Past mood issues with feeling down \u2192 medium? Maybe contributes to substance use but now he's clean. Not sure how that affects recid.\n\nSo overall, considering multiple high and some medium factors, plus his age being a double-edged sword. The risk assessment would probably lean towards high or medium. Given the number of prior arrests and education issues, I'd say high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is only 18 years old despite multiple criminal convictions, which may indicate a lack of life experience but also potential motivation to change due to his developing age.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED significantly reduces opportunities for positive development and self-employment, contributing to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 18 could indicate a period of instability but may transition into greater independence later.
