    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 21. Younger individuals might have fewer life experiences, which could mean less criminal history but also perhaps more impulsive behavior. But since she has a conviction already, that's a significant point.\n\nRace: She identifies as White. From what I know, racial factors can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues and disparities in the justice system. However, without specific data linking her race directly to higher risk, it's hard to assign a high weight here. Maybe medium because some factors are present but not conclusive.\n\nConvictions: She has one. Single conviction might indicate past behavior, but again, it depends on the nature of the offense. If it was minor or recent, maybe lower risk, but if it's severe, like violent crime, then higher risk. Since it's a general conviction without specifics, perhaps medium.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse can increase recidivism because drugs can impair judgment and decision-making, leading to more impulsive behavior or reoffending. This could be high.\n\nEmployment: She's currently not employed but enrolled in college. Not working might mean she doesn't have steady income, which could contribute to financial stress or other issues that might lead her to engage in illegal activities again. Maybe medium.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married and living alone. Living arrangement isn't directly tied to crime rates, but sometimes lonliness can increase stress, which might affect behavior. Maybe low impact here.\n\nEducation: She has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides better job opportunities and life skills. So this factor would be low.\n\nNumber of jobs: She held one job last year. Single job stability can help avoid unemployment, which might reduce stress and impulsive decisions. Low impact here.\n\nReligion: She believes in God's influence on her. Religious factors can sometimes lead to more prosocial behavior or better life planning compared to secular individuals. So maybe low.\n\n household size at young age: Household of 4 when she was younger. Smaller households during formative years might have different dynamics, but without data linking family size directly to recidivism, it's hard to assign a weight here. Maybe medium because larger families can sometimes provide more support or stress, but not necessarily tied to crime.\n\nPutting this all together: The most significant risk factors seem to be the single prior conviction and drug use. The rest don't contribute as strongly. So I'd say high risk because of the marijuana use and previous offense.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 21 may present fewer life experiences, possibly leading to impulsive behavior despite having a conviction.\",\n     \"low\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Racial factors can influence recidivism rates due to systemic disparities in the justice system.
