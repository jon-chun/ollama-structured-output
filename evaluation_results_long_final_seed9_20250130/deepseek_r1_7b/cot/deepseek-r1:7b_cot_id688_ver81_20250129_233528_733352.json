    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female. First, her age is quite young, which might indicate she's still developing skills that could help reduce recidivism. Her race isn't an issue here since we're focusing on personal factors.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction, but only once. That's not too bad yet. Her education level at associate college suggests some life skills, which is positive. \n\nLiving alone might mean she doesn\u2019t have support, which could increase risk. Drug use in the past four years, even if it was just marijuana, can affect trust and relationships.\n\nHer job experience is minimal\u2014only one job last year. That\u2019s not much experience for finding a steady job later, increasing risk. \n\nShe's in a household of four at a young age; family support could help her stay out of trouble now but might change as she grows up.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month suggests she's mentally stable, which is good. Her belief in God shows strong moral compass, which can be a positive influence.\n\nPutting it all together: factors like education and job experience are on her side, but living alone, drug use, and family background could increase risk. Considering all this, I\u2019d assign a medium relative weight to her risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is relatively young (21 years old), which may indicate she has fewer life experiences that could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"She has one prior arrest and conviction, which does suggest some recidivism risk but not extremely high.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She is currently enrolled in a 2-year college after completing associate/junior college, indicating ongoing education efforts that may help with job stability and reduced criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Housing Stability\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which could increase risk of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking substances if not properly supported.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years.
