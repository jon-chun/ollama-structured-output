    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given a case of a 21-year-old female who's been arrested once and convicted. She needs to be assessed for her risk of rearrest within the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young, but she's already been through one arrest. That might indicate some prior issues or challenges in her life that led to this conviction.\n\nShe identifies as White, which could be a factor depending on any racial biases in the justice system, but since I'm focusing on risk assessment rather than systemic issues, maybe it doesn't directly impact her individual risk here unless there's evidence of discrimination, which isn't provided.\n\nHer height and weight are listed: 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs. This might not be a direct indicator of risk, but could relate to health issues or substance use, though she's only mentioned marijuana use in the past four years. Her BMI would matter here; 163 lbs at 6'1\" is about 21.7 BMI, which is within the healthy range, so maybe no issue there.\n\nShe's living alone and never married. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor if she has support networks, but in this case, since she hasn't been married or in a committed relationship for more than two years, that might not provide much support. On the flip side, being alone doesn't necessarily make her a risk-taker.\n\nShe's completed associate college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year program. Education can be a positive factor because higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and stability, which reduce recidivism risk. So this could lower her risk.\n\nShe's held only one job during the past year. Job instability can increase the likelihood of substance use, lack of skills for new jobs, or financial stress, all of which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHer drug use history is limited to marijuana in the past four years, and she hasn't felt depressed recently. This might suggest she's using drugs recreationally rather than as a problem-solving tool, but it could also be a sign of self-control, which would lower her risk. However, occasional drug use can sometimes correlate with other risky behaviors.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households often have more support systems and resources for children, so this might indicate she had some form of stability or protective factors when younger, which could positively influence her current risk level.\n\nLastly, she believes that God has something to do with her personal decisions. This indicates a strong moral framework and possibly higher self-discipline, which are positive risk factors as they suggest she's more likely to make responsible choices.\n\nPutting this all together: The education is a strong positive factor (low risk). Joblessness for one year could be medium or low because holding even one job can provide some stability. Her living situation at a younger age might have been protective, but now she lives alone, which might not necessarily increase her risk. Drug use is minor and recent, so maybe low to medium. Age 21 with prior arrest could be high to medium.\n\nHowever, the presence of any significant risk factors like being in only one job for a year (which can lead to unemployment spells) or past drug use could temper the overall risk assessment. The moral beliefs are positive but don't necessarily negate other potential issues.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: Education is low, living alone and single might be medium, prior arrest high, job held once maybe medium, drug use recent maybe low, household size at young age maybe medium, and God involvement positive. So overall, her risk of rearrest would likely be low to medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 21 years old might indicate some prior issues or challenges leading to this conviction, but she has successfully completed associate college and is enrolled in a 2-year program which suggests stability and education that can positively influence her risk profile.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone since she hasn't been married for more than two years might not provide significant support networks, but it doesn't necessarily indicate increased risk without other contributing factors like substance use or employment instability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the past year can provide some level of stability and financial independence, which are positive indicators for recidivism risk while they can also be a source of stress if not fulfilling or leading to substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years is occasional and she hasn't felt depressed recently, suggesting self-control, which could lower her risk despite occasional drug use often correlating with other risky behaviors.
