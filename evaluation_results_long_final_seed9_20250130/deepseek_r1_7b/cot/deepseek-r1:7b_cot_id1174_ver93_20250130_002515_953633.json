    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor provided for an 18-year-old male and then predict his rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let's start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested four times and convicted once. Repeated convictions are a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, which definitely increases the risk of future arrests. So that's probably high weight.\n\nHe is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 145 lbs. While weight can be an indicator of certain risks like substance abuse or physical health issues, without specific information about his health or substance use beyond the provided data, it might not add much unless there are other factors related to his weight. Since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, maybe this factor isn't as high.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because loneliness can lead to self-harm or substance abuse. It also increases vulnerability to other negative influences, so that might be medium to high weight.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests he has limited education. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to fewer opportunities for positive outcomes or more involvement in the criminal system. That should be a high factor.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year, which might indicate limited income stability or substance use as a means of coping. This could contribute to lower self-esteem and substance abuse issues, so maybe medium weight.\n\nNot using drugs in the past four years is positive, but he does feel down sometimes. Emotional distress without substance use can be linked to other forms of criminal behavior like theft or vandalism. So that's probably high risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of four. Big family sizes are often associated with higher recidivism rates because of the increased influence of negative family dynamics, possibly leading to more delinquent behavior. That should be high weight.\n\nConsidering that God has no role in his life, this might indicate a lack of religious support or guidance, which can leave him vulnerable to other influences. This is another high risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple factors like past convictions, limited education, living alone, and emotional distress are strong indicators of higher recidivism. The high confidence level makes sense because these factors collectively point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Past Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of criminal behavior, which significantly increases the likelihood of future arrests and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can contribute to feelings of loneliness, which may lead to self-harm or other negative behaviors that could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not being enrolled in college are strong indicators of limited opportunities for positive outcomes and higher involvement in the criminal system.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Only one job held during the year may indicate limited income stability or substance use as a coping mechanism, which can contribute to lower self-esteem and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Frequent feelings of sadness without substance use can be linked to other forms of criminal behavior, such as theft or vandalism, increasing rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of four is often associated with higher recidivism rates due to negative family dynamics and increased influence from delinquent peers.\"),\n    (\"Religious Influence\", \"high\", \"Considering that God has no role in his life may leave him vulnerable to other influences that could contribute to criminal behavior or substance use issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
