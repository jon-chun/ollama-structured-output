    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female based on her situation. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that should be high weight.\n\nHer age is 21, which is relatively young, but since she's already been convicted once, maybe her age doesn't play as big a role here as it might for someone younger without a history.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure how much race plays into recidivism risk assessment now, but sometimes it can be considered as a mitigating factor if she has support from her community. However, in this case, since she's being assessed based on factors like her current situation, maybe the race isn't directly relevant here.\n\nShe is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Her weight category could affect her self-perception and how she perceives her risk, but without information on her health or lifestyle choices related to substance use, it's hard to tie this into recidivism.\n\n living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because there are fewer people around who might support her or provide substance use cues. But in this case, she has no ties to her previous household of four, so maybe that doesn't apply as much.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is currently single. Marital status isn't typically a strong risk factor unless it's related to substance use or other issues she might be dealing with.\n\nHer education level: associate degree from junior college and currently in 2-year college. Higher education can correlate with lower recidivism because of better job prospects, but since she's still completing her studies, maybe this isn't a strong mitigating factor yet.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment is generally protective as it provides income and stability, so that might be low to medium weight.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Past drug use can be a risk factor if it's related to substance abuse which could lead to other criminal behaviors or higher recidivism rates. It's important to note her current feelings of not feeling depressed, but I think prior drug use is still a concern.\n\nHer belief in God: This might relate more to personal behavior than risk assessment. Unless she has issues with religion affecting her decision-making, which isn't indicated here.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. A larger household can sometimes provide support and reduce stressors, but again, without knowing if those dynamics are positive or negative, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting this all together: The most significant factors are the prior conviction (high risk), past drug use (moderate risk), lack of employment (low impact?), living alone (perhaps protective). However, her age is young, which might reduce some of these risks. I'm leaning towards a high relative weight because of the prior arrest and drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction, indicating a history of criminal behavior that can predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Past Four Years\", \"moderate\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years, which could be a risk factor related to substance abuse potentially leading to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may provide some protection from supportive influences, but this factor is not as significant compared to other factors like prior convictions and substance use.\"), \n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"She held one job during the year; employment generally correlates with lower recidivism due to stability and income security.\"),\n    (\"Past Household Size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of four at an early age may not necessarily be a strong risk factor without additional context on the nature of that environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
