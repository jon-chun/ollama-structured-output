Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's a solid indicator of past behavior issues, which is high risk right there.\n\nHe's only 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. I'm not sure how his weight affects recidivism, but maybe it's more about health rather than behavior. So probably low to medium impact.\n\nLiving alone means fewer support systems around him. Maybe less help if he starts down again, so that could be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a big red flag because education can predict job opportunities and stable living. Low to medium risk here.\n\nOnly one job in the past year\u2014maybe unstable income which can lead to stress. Medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't use drugs, which is positive, but he's had bad mood episodes recently. That could be stress or mental health issues affecting his behavior. High risk from that.\n\nYouth living with four people sounds like a stable home environment when he was younger, so maybe lower risk? But it might not protect him now; past environments don't always predict future behavior.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God\u2014could lead to different motivations and behaviors, increasing risk. High here.\n\nPutting it all together: high due to multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, and personal beliefs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate past behavior issues that may predict future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age and living conditions\", \"medium\", \"Living with four people at a young age might have provided some stability, but it doesn't necessarily protect against future issues.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can be related to lower job opportunities and stable living, which may contribute to higher risk but not as directly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"job status\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job for a year could indicate potential stress or instability, which might influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is positive, but mood swings could be due to other stressors.\"),\n    (\"mood episodes\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of low mood without any drug use could indicate unaddressed stress or mental health issues that may affect behavior.\"),\n    (\"religion and belief system\", \"high\", \"Believing in God might provide moral guidance, but not holding that belief could lead to different motivations and behaviors, increasing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
