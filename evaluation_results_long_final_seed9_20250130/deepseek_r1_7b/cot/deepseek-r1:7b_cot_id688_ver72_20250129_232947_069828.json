    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. That's relatively young, so maybe she has less time left to commit another crime before release. But still, it's early in her life, which could be a double-edged sword depending on other factors.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues and stereotypes, but this is just one data point among many. It might not have a huge impact alone unless combined with other factors like socioeconomic status or prior convictions.\n\nOne arrest and one conviction mean she's already had some involvement in the legal system. That could indicate past behavior that might be predictive of future actions, though it depends on whether it was for serious offenses or minor infractions.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, weight 163 lbs. While physical characteristics can sometimes correlate with certain behaviors, they're not significant predictors on their own. Her current living situation alone isn't provided, but she's living alone now, which might suggest some independence that could reduce risk factors related to supervision or environment.\n\nShe has a bachelor's degree in associate/junior college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can be a mitigating factor as higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and self-sufficiency. Being actively studying might indicate she's proactive about her future, which could lower recidivism risk.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment stability is generally associated with lower recidivism rates because having a job can provide financial stability and purpose. However, if that job was unstable or in a low-paying industry, it might not have as much of an impact.\n\nDrug use history: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself is a risk factor, but sometimes relapse after treatment shows improvement. Her recent positive drug test (if any) would be more concerning. Her lack of recent depression could mean better mental health, which might mitigate some drug-related risks.\n\nHer belief in God suggests religious involvement and possibly moral accountability. People who engage with religion can have strong values that may deter criminal behavior, contributing to lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: While there are several mitigating factors like education, job experience, and living alone, the arrest and past substance use could be significant risk factors. The recidivism rate is likely influenced by prior convictions, drug use, and perhaps the lack of support system since she's living alone. \n\nI'm leaning towards a low to medium relative weight because the positive factors like education and employment are strong mitigators, but there are still some concerning points that could increase risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age can have both positive and negative implications.
