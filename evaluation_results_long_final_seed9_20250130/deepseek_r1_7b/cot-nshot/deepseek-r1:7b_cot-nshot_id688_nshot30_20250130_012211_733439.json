    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a clear indicator of past issues, so that should be a high weight factor.\n\nShe completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year program. Education can sometimes predict better outcomes, but if she's actively pursuing further education, it might slightly reduce recidivism risk. Maybe medium weight here.\n\nLiving alone isn't directly tied to recidivism unless there are other factors like instability, which doesn't seem to be the case here. So low weight.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance use can have varying effects on behavior and relationships. Since she's not feeling down now, maybe a medium weight.\n\nHer household at age was size 4, which is moderate. Unless there were issues in that household that affected her earlier, it might be low.\n\nConsidering God as a positive influence gives some hope for better outcomes, so this could lower the risk. High weight here.\n\nShe's currently employed one job, which can help with stability and reduce recidivism. Maybe medium to high.\n\nPutting all these together, despite the arrest, her education and current job seem positive factors that might outweigh other negatives like substance use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"She has one arrest and a conviction which significantly indicates past behavior issues that could influence future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"She completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which suggests she is committed to furthering her education and may reduce recidivism risk compared to those without such commitment.\"),\n    (\"living arrangement\", \"low\", \"She is currently living alone, which generally correlates with better stability and lower recidivism risk compared to living with others who might introduce potential issues.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"medium\", \"She has a history of marijuana use but has not felt depressed recently.
