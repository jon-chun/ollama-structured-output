    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted once. That seems like a significant issue. More arrests usually mean more time spent in trouble, which could increase the chance of rearrest.\n\nHe's only 18 and living alone without a high school diploma or GED. Education is often linked with better job opportunities and stability, so not having that might put him at a disadvantage.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which can be isolating. Social support is important for mental health and dealing with stress, so this could be another risk factor.\n\nNot using drugs but feeling down sometimes\u2014he's showing signs of mental health issues. If he's struggling with emotions, it might affect his ability to function or make positive choices.\n\nHe lived in a household of four at a young age, which means he had limited support and exposure to a stable environment. That could have long-term effects on his stability.\n\nConsidering that God has no influence on his personal matters\u2014he seems to rely solely on human factors, which might not provide the necessary support or guidance.\n\nPutting all these together, each risk factor is pointing towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. The multiple arrests and unstable living situation are major red flags. His lack of education and current isolation probably contribute to him being more likely to fall back into similar behaviors. Additionally, his mental health issues might make him more susceptible to stressors that could lead to criminal behavior again.\n\nSo, considering all these weighted factors\u2014each one is high because they significantly impact his chances\u2014I'm leaning towards a \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"A high number of arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested four times, which can indicate past problematic behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education often correlates with lower job opportunities and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to social isolation, which may contribute to emotional distress and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental health concerns indicated by feelings of depression\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues can impede an individual's ability to make positive decisions and avoid criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household size at a young age was four\", \"medium\", \"Living in a larger household may have provided less stability, which could affect future social support and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"No religious influence on personal matters\", \"high\", \"Reliance on human factors for guidance might leave the individual vulnerable to negative influences or stressors that could lead to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
