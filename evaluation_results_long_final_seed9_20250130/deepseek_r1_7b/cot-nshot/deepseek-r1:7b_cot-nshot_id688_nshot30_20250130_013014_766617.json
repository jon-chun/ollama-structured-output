    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a 21-year-old female who's White. Let me go through her risk factors one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested once and convicted. Looking at the examples, people with even one prior arrest had varying outcomes, but some had YES while others NO. So this is probably medium weight because it's significant but not the most impactful factor alone.\n\nShe's completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This seems like higher education could correlate with lower recidivism, so maybe high weight. But being enrolled might indicate active efforts to stay out of trouble, so that adds some support for a lower risk.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone\u2014both factors are generally protective, so this should have a high weight. Marital status can influence social support and stress levels, which might reduce the chance of recidivism.\n\nHolding one job during the year is positive because having stable employment reduces financial dependency and potential stressors. So that's another high-weight factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana\u2014marijuana is a mild drug and not as strongly associated with severe recidivism as harder drugs like cocaine or alcohol. But still, any drug use can be concerning. Since she has used it but hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe the risk isn't too high.\n\nShe's lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Larger households often have more support and fewer conflicts, so that should be a protective factor with high weight.\n\nConsidering God as part of her personal factors\u2014many examples mentioned similar beliefs without strong recidivism outcomes. So this is probably medium weight because it doesn't directly correlate but can indicate a sense of purpose which might mitigate stressors.\n\nPutting all together: Prior arrest (medium), education and enrollment (high), living alone (high), stable job (high), past drug use (low-medium), household size (high), God's role (medium). \n\nCalculating the risk, she has multiple protective factors but also one significant negative. The high weight of education and living alone likely lowers her risk enough to predict NO for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a prior arrest conviction which can be a significant factor in recidivism, though it is not the most impactful on its own.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"She has completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating ongoing educational efforts which are generally protective against rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can reduce stressors and provide less social support, making it a key protective factor that lowers the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"high\", \"She has held one job during the year, providing financial stability and reducing dependency on substance use which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"While she has used marijuana in the past four years, not feeling depressed recently suggests a possible reduction in substance use's impact on her current behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of size 4 at a young age indicates less stress and more support, which is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Influence\", \"medium\", \"Her belief in God may provide a sense of purpose but does not directly correlate with reduced substance use or other risk factors commonly associated with recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
