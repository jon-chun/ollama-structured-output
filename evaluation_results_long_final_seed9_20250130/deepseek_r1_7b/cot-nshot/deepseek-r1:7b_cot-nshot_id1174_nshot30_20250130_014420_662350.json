    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me break down his risk factors based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 4 times and convicted. In the previous examples, higher arrests often led to a YES outcome, like in Example #26 and #30 where similar stats resulted in YES. So that's a high weight because more arrests usually mean a higher chance of recidivism.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That\u2019s also a high risk factor as seen in Examples #4, #18, etc., which resulted in YES outcomes consistently.\n\nLiving alone is another risk factor. In the examples, living alone often correlated with higher recidivism rates, so that's a high weight here too.\n\nHe doesn't have a job but has held one during the year. That\u2019s actually a mitigating factor because having some income can help reduce recidivism. So this might be a lower weight.\n\nNo drug use is positive, which reduces risk, so maybe low weight or even no weight if it's not applicable.\n\nFeeling down for a month could indicate emotional distress but isn't directly tied to crime stats. Maybe medium weight since it's one of the factors considered in some examples as influencing self-esteem but not direct recidivism.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 4, which is similar to other examples with larger households correlating with higher risk. So high weight here.\n\nConsidering God has no influence on his personal issues might be a mitigating factor if it's related to mental health, but since he doesn't use drugs and has no arrests, maybe medium or low weight.\n\nPutting this together: High weight for prior convictions (4), lack of education (high), living alone (high). Medium for job status. Low for drug use. Medium for mood, high for household size, and perhaps low for his belief in God.\n\nSince most factors point towards higher risk with some mitigating ones, but the overall recidivism rate is still likely to be YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of past behavior that may contribute to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"The lack of a high school diploma or GED significantly impacts employability and self-sufficiency, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone is a known risk factor for substance abuse, delinquency, and overall criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding one job despite not being employed full-time may indicate potential for self-reliance and reduced risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests a lower risk compared to those who have used substances regularly.\"),\n    (\"Mood/Feeling Down\", \"medium\", \"Perceived emotional distress could influence behavior but does not directly correlate with immediate criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of size 4 may contribute to substance abuse and unstable living conditions, increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"The absence of religious influence on his personal life could be associated with higher self-esteem or different life choices.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
