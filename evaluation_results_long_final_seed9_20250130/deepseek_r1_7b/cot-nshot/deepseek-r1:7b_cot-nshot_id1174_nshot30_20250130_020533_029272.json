    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted once. Having multiple arrests is a strong indicator of higher risk because it shows he's had trouble adhering to laws before. That should probably be a high-weight factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. Weight alone might not be a huge issue unless combined with other factors, but in this case, since his BMI isn't mentioned, I'll consider it as low weight.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk because he might have less support system which could contribute to substance abuse or other issues. So that's a medium factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates, so lack of education should be a high-weight factor here.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having previous work experience can be positive because it shows he has employable skills, but if he's currently unemployed due to other issues, that might not help much. Since he's lost his job or maybe not actively working, this could be medium.\n\nNo drug use in past four years, which is good. However, sometimes people might not report drug use if they're embarrassed or feel ashamed. But since he says some of the time he feels down, it's possible he uses drugs now but just didn't report recently. So maybe low weight for drug use.\n\nHe felt down during the month; this could indicate depression or stress, which can affect recidivism rates. This is a medium factor because while it's concerning, not using drugs would mitigate some risk.\n\nAt young age, lived in a household of four. Larger households might provide more supervision but also possibly neglect if something went wrong in the family home. Since he was convicted for multiple times before, maybe this reflects past issues with the family environment, so high weight.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. Religious disconnection can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to lack of guidance and support systems, so that's a high-weight factor.\n\nPutting it all together: four prior arrests (high), no diploma or GED (high), living alone (medium), no recent drugs but some mood issues (low), family of four at 18 (high), and belief in nothing (high). So the main factors are high weight. The prediction should be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of multiple arrests (4 times) and a conviction, indicating past disciplinary issues which can correlate with higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests limited educational opportunities and potential for future involvement in the criminal system.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, especially at a young age, may indicate a lack of support which could contribute to substance abuse issues or other behavioral problems.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"No previous job held during the past year might suggest instability or current unemployment, but this does not directly correlate with high recidivism risk without additional factors like drug use or mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, though feelings of depression or low mood could indicate substance abuse or mental health issues which may contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"high\", \"Living with a household size of 4 at age 18, combined with prior arrests, suggests potential neglect or family dysfunction which can increase risk of involvement in the criminal system.\"),\n    (\"religion_effective_support\", \"high\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with his life may reduce support and guidance, potentially leading to increased risky behaviors and higher likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
