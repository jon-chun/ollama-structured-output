    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given risk factors for this 21-year-old female and predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a moderate risk indicator because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism.\n\nShe's completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment usually reduces the risk of rearrest, so this should be low to medium weight.\n\nLiving alone isn't directly listed as a risk factor, but living situation can sometimes correlate with other factors like support networks, which might mitigate risk here.\n\nUsing marijuana past four years\u2014marijuana use is not as strongly linked compared to more hazardous drugs. Since she hasn't felt depressed recently either, this might suggest lower risk from drug use in this context.\n\nHer household size at a young age was 4. Larger households can provide support and stability, which could reduce risk factors. However, it's not directly tied to recidivism unless it relates to other factors like support networks or abuse exposure.\n\nConsidering God as part of her personal life indicates a potentially supportive environment, which is generally protective against recidivism.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest (medium), education (low), living alone (neutral), marijuana use (low), household size (neutral), and spiritual involvement (low). These factors don't strongly indicate a high risk. However, the prior arrest might weigh more than the others. Considering each factor's weight, I think she has a low to medium risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of her risk factors:\n\n- Prior Arrest: Medium\n- Educational Attainment: Low\n- Living Alone: Neutral\n- Drug Use (Marijuana): Low\n- Household Size at Young Age: Neutral\n- Spiritual Involvement: Low\n\nThe prediction is that she has a low to medium risk, leading to an outcome of \"NO\" with high confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Past arrests, especially prior convictions, are significant indicators of recidivism. This individual has one conviction, which moderately increases the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Educational Attainment\", \"low\", \"She has completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, factors that are typically protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"neutral\", \"Living alone does not inherently indicate high risk but can be mitigated by other factors such as education and support networks which this individual possesses to some extent.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"Her use of marijuana in the past four years is noted, but there has been no recent indication of depression. This suggests that recent substance use may not pose a high risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"neutral\", \"She lived in a household of size 4 at a young age, which could indicate some level of stability and support, thereby mitigating the risk factors associated with larger households often linked to abuse or neglect\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Involvement\", \"low\", \"Her belief in God is considered and may provide a protective factor against recidivism through spiritual guidance or support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
