    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. She's White, single, living alone, has a associate/junior college degree while enrolled in a 2-year college, worked one job, used marijuana, and considers God as part of her personal factors.\n\nLooking at each risk factor: Being White doesn't seem directly linked to recidivism here. She's never married, so no history of cohabitation or marriage issues. Living alone is common among first-time offenders but might indicate some instability. Her education level\u2014though she's attending college\u2014isn't a strong positive indicator.\n\nHer past arrest and conviction are significant because prior offense history usually increases recidivism risk. She held one job, which isn't bad on its own but her use of marijuana could be a red flag for substance abuse issues that might contribute to future problems. Considering God is part of her support system, maybe she's more committed, but if it's affecting her negatively, like drug use, that's still concerning.\n\nPutting this together: Prior arrest (high risk), education status doesn't help much (low impact), living alone isn't a big issue here (medium? Since it's common), college enrollment might show commitment but also could mean she's focused on other things. Drug use is a medium risk because it can affect both current and future behavior.\n\nSo, overall, the prior offense history seems like the strongest indicator for rearrest. The rest of the factors either don't support it (education) or have mixed impacts. Therefore, I think her risk is high based on the prior arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"She is currently enrolled in a 2-year college and has completed an associate/junior college degree, which does not directly contribute to reducing recidivism risk but also doesn't provide strong protection against it.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be linked to higher levels of stress or substance use issues, which might indirectly affect behavior over time but is not a direct indicator of high risk like prior arrest.\"),\n    (\"college_enrollment\", \"low\", \"While she is enrolled in college, the fact that she has only held one job during her current phase suggests limited experience and potential lack of motivation for further efforts if needed.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Her use of marijuana could potentially lead to substance abuse issues which might contribute to criminal behavior or difficulties in reintegration, thus indicating a medium risk factor.\"),\n    (\"god_support\", \"low\", \"Considering God is part of her support system may indicate higher accountability and commitment, but if it has negatively impacted her substance use, this could be a mitigating factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
