    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step. The person is a 21-year-old White female with several risk factors that I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history: one arrest and a conviction. This is a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. So, this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nNext, her education level: she's completed an associate or junior college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year program. While having some formal education can sometimes reduce recidivism, the fact that she's still pursuing further education might indicate better motivation or self-discipline, which could lower the risk compared to someone with no education.\n\nShe's living alone, which is generally considered positive for recidivism as it shows independence and responsibility. However, her living situation isn't a major risk factor here.\n\nHer drug use: she has used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use can be more tolerated than harder drugs like cocaine or heroin, so while it's a risk factor, it might not be as severe as other drug uses. Since she hasn't felt depressed recently, this might suggest better mental health management, slightly mitigating the risk.\n\nShe was part of a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to various stressors or social issues, but it's not always directly linked. It depends on other factors like family dynamics and support systems.\n\nHer belief in God: she thinks God is involved in her life. This is generally protective against recidivism as religious beliefs often provide a sense of moral guidance and stability.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the high risk from the prior arrest seems to dominate. The other factors either mitigate or don't significantly affect the risk. Therefore, I would predict she has a high risk of recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has one prior arrest and conviction, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college.
