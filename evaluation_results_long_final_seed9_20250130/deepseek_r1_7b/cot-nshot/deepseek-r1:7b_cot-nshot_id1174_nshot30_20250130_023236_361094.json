    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step. The individual is an 18-year-old Black male with several risk factors to consider.\n\nFirst, his age being 18 is a strong indicator of recidivism since he's still developing. That should be a high weight factor because it's a critical period for decision-making.\n\nHe has a history of arrests\u2014four times and a conviction. Each arrest increases the risk of reoffending, so this is definitely a high-weight factor.\n\nHis lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate means he may not have the necessary skills to find stable employment, which is another high-weight risk factor.\n\nLiving alone can isolate him, potentially leading to emotional distress, but I'm not sure if that's as high a weight as other factors. Still, it should be considered medium.\n\nNo college enrollment suggests limited opportunities and possibly lower self-esteem or motivation\u2014medium weight.\n\nHe held only one job during the year; part-time work might offer some stability, so maybe a low to medium weight.\n\nNot using drugs is positive, but sometimes substance use can have underlying issues. Since he hasn't used drugs in four years, it's less of a risk factor here\u2014low weight.\n\nFeeling down for much of the month could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are significant and should be high weight.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Larger households can sometimes offer more support but might also mean neglect if not properly supervised\u2014medium to low depending on context.\n\nConsidering God has no influence is a strong indicator of potential self-reliance but could also suggest a lack of guidance, which is high risk.\n\nPutting all these together: High for age, four arrests, no diploma, living alone, no college, one job. Medium for feeling down and household size. Low for job type and drug use.\n\nCalculating the overall risk\u2014high factors are more influential here. So, this person is likely to be rearrested in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, a critical age for decision-making related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and one conviction significantly increase the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma/GED certificate reduces future earning potential and employability.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, potentially increasing emotional distress and depression.\"),\n    (\"College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Not enrolled in college limits opportunities for education and skill development.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Held only one job during the year, which may offer limited stability and skills transfer.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drugs used in the past four years, reducing potential substance-related issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"high\", \"Felt down for much of the past month, indicating possible mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived with a household of size 4, which may offer some support but also potential neglect if not properly supervised.\"),\n    (\"God's Influence\", \"high\", \"Consideration that God has no influence suggests a lack of guidance and potential self-reliance issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
