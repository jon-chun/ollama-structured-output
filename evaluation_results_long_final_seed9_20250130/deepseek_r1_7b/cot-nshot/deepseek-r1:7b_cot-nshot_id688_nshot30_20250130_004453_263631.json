    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 21 years old, which is considered a young age. Younger individuals might have fewer life experiences that could contribute to criminal behavior. So I'd assign a low weight here.\n\nEducation level: She has completed associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This indicates she's actively pursuing higher education, which is generally associated with lower recidivism risk. So this factor would also have a low weight.\n\nLiving situation: She's living alone. Living independently can provide stability and reduce exposure to substance abuse environments, so I'd give her this factor a low weight as well.\n\nNumber of jobs held during the year: She has only held 1 job. Having a steady job is usually beneficial for personal stability and financial management, which are good indicators of lower recidivism. So another low weight here.\n\nDrug use history: She's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While past drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it correlates with other negative behaviors or higher recidivism rates, her recent lack of depression might mitigate this slightly. Maybe she's managed to control her substance use since then.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: She lived in a household of size 4. Larger households are often associated with more support and less stress, which could be protective against recidivism. So another low weight here.\n\nReligious belief: She believes God has something to do with her personal matters. Religious involvement can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates as it provides guidance and can influence behavior positively. This factor would have a low weight.\n\nPutting all these together, the factors that might predict a higher risk are generally absent or neutral. Her education, living situation, job stability, and positive religious belief all suggest she's in a favorable position. The only negative factor is her past drug use, but since it's recent and she's not showing signs of depression now, this might not significantly increase her risk.\n\nConsidering the examples provided, when these factors were present to varying degrees, the outcomes varied between YES and NO. However, in cases where education was high, living alone, and no significant negative factors, the outcome was more likely NO (as seen in examples 26-30). \n\nTherefore, weighing each factor as low or medium based on their influence, but since all factors are either low or not present enough to tip it higher, the prediction would lean towards NO with a lower confidence. But wait, looking at example 14 where she had similar factors except for living in an urban area and no religion, her outcome was YES. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, actually, in example 26-30, some have higher education or better living situations but still the outcomes are mixed. Since this case has multiple protective factors (education, living alone, enrolled in college), even with a past drug use, it might predict a NO outcome. But because of that single negative factor, perhaps the confidence is slightly lower.\n\nSo I'll assign each risk factor as low weight except for maybe the education and job history which are not directly related to recidivism but could be protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 21 suggests she may have fewer life experiences contributing to criminal behavior, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating pursuit of higher education which usually correlates with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone provides stability and reduced exposure to substance abuse environments, further reducing risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs Held During the Year\", \"low\", \"Holding only 1 job indicates personal stability and financial management, which are positive indicators for lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use in the past four years but recent lack of depression may mitigate this slightly, making it a moderate factor affecting risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 is associated with more support and less stress, providing protective factors for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing God has something to do with personal matters can provide guidance influencing behavior positively, further reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
