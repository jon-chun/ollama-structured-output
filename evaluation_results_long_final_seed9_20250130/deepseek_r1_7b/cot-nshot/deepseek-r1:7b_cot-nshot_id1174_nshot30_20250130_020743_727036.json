    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the risk factors from the case:\n\n- Age: 18 years old (which is quite young, but maybe not directly a high risk)\n- Arrests and convictions: 4 times, convicted\n- Weight and height: 5 feet 10 inches, 145 lbs. Not sure about this one's impact.\n- Marital status: Never married\n- Living situation: Currently living alone\n- Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n- Jobs held: 1 during the year\n- Drug use: Never used drugs in past four years, but felt low mood recently\n- Age at which they lived with parents: Household size of 4\n\nNow, comparing this case to the examples provided earlier. Looking at the previous cases:\n\nIn Example #6, an 18-year-old Black male was convicted 4 times and lived alone, had no diploma, held 1 job, felt low mood, household size 4. The outcome was YES.\n\nAnother example with similar factors (convictions, age, living alone, lack of education) also resulted in YES.\n\nIn Example #26, an 18-year-old Black male with 4 convictions, living alone, no diploma, held 1 job, low mood, household size 5. Outcome was YES.\n\nSo the common threads are: multiple arrests (high), living alone (medium), lack of education (high), recent low mood (low to medium risk).\n\nThe factors that might be contributing less are: no drug use and not feeling too bad except for a small part of the month.\n\nSince this person is similar in many aspects to previous YES cases, especially regarding multiple arrests, living alone, and lack of education, I would predict a high recidivism rate. The additional factor of feeling down might even add to the risk, though it's only a minor dip.\n\nSo putting it all together, his risk factors point towards a higher chance of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 18 years old, which might not directly correlate to high recidivism but could be a consideration given the context of living with parents and potential developmental factors.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests (4 times) and a conviction indicate past involvement in the judicial system, increasing risk of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"The person is 5 feet 10 inches tall; height alone does not significantly impact recidivism risk unless combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"He weighs 145 lbs.
