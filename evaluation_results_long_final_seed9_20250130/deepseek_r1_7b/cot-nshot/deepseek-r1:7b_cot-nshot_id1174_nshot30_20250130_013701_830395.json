    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young, but he's already been arrested four times and convicted. That seems like a strong indicator of past problematic behavior, so that should be high risk.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED, which puts him at a disadvantage compared to others in society. Not having these credentials can lead to more job opportunities being limited, making him a higher risk for future issues.\n\nLiving alone might not seem like much, but if he's never married and living alone could imply some instability, maybe financial or emotional. Plus, he doesn't have any support system which isn't great for his well-being, so that's another high factor.\n\nHe's currently not in a relationship, which means he has no one to rely on besides himself. That lack of support can contribute to him getting into trouble again if things go south.\n\nNot having a job is concerning too. If someone under 20 isn't working, they might be relying on others for support, but also, not having any income can make it harder to build a stable life or pay for any responsibilities like rent or food.\n\nHe feels down and has used no drugs in the past four years, but he's had some bad feelings recently. Maybe that emotional state could affect his ability to function positively again.\n\nNot having a household of size 4 at a young age might suggest he was raised in an environment with more support. But if that's the case now? Wait, actually, he's living alone and has no children mentioned, so maybe not relevant here.\n\nConsidering God has nothing to do with his life could mean he's more self-reliant or perhaps more focused on other aspects of life. But it also might indicate he doesn't have a strong support network, which isn't great for recidivism risk.\n\nPutting all these together: high school dropouts are at higher risk (high), multiple arrests and convictions make him more likely to reoffend (high). Living alone without a support system is another red flag. His emotional state might affect his ability to get things back on track, but he's not using drugs which could be a protective factor.\n\nConsidering the examples given earlier, people with multipleConvictions, no diploma, living alone, and recent negative feelings often had high outcomes like YES for 3-year recidivism. So combining all these factors, I'm leaning towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which may indicate limited life experience and higher vulnerability to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED, placing him at a disadvantage in the job market and potentially contributing to instability.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement\", \"high\", \"Living alone without support from family or others may increase stress and reduce opportunities for positive interactions which could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Not having a job might limit his ability to provide for himself, but it doesn't directly correlate strongly with rearrest compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"low\", \"He has felt down recently, which could be a sign of personal distress that might affect his behavior, though not as direct a risk factor as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Support Network\", \"medium\", \"Living alone suggests he doesn't have the same level of support from family or others, which is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Considering God has nothing to do with his life may indicate limited religious support but isn't directly linked to recidivism risk as other factors are more significant.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
