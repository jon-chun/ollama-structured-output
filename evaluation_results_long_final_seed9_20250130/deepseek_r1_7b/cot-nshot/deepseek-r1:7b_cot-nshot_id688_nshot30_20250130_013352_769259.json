    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So, I'm given a case of a 21-year-old female who's White, has been convicted once for an arrest, is currently living alone, completed her associate/junior college, enrolled in a 2-year college, held one job recently, used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently, lived in a household of four at a young age, and believes in God. I need to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the risk factors based on the provided examples. Each factor's weight is determined by how strongly it contributes to recidivism:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: She has one prior arrest which could indicate some past behavior that might lead to similar issues again.\n2. **Education Level**: She has a higher education (associate/junior college) and is currently enrolled in a 2-year program, which might suggest she's proactive about her education.\n3. **Living Situation**: Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of potential instability or substance use issues.\n4. **Drug Use**: She used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use can be a risk factor if it led to problems.\n5. **Household Size at Young Age**: A household size of four might suggest she experienced more stress or dependency on others, which could relate to her current behavior.\n6. **Belief in God**: She considers God as part of her personal life, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to non-religious individuals.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- **Arrest History (Medium)**: One prior arrest might predict some risk but not extremely high.\n- **Education Level (High)**: Higher education and current enrollment suggest she's motivated to change behavior.\n- **Living Alone (Low/Medium)**: Living alone could be neutral or slightly negative depending on other factors, but without more info, it's medium.\n- **Drug Use (Medium)**: Used marijuana recently; medium risk as it's a past behavior.\n- **Household Size at Young Age (Medium)**: Could indicate prior issues but not directly linked to current behavior unless she's dealing with similar stress now.\n- **Belief in God (High)**: Strong correlation with lower recidivism, so high weight.\n\nLooking at the examples, most factors like education and belief in God had a significant impact. For instance, in example 6, being White, two prior arrests, living alone, not enrolled in school, used marijuana, small household, didn't consider religion\u2014all contributed to \"NO.\" Conversely, higher education or considering religion led to \"YES.\"\n\nIn this case, her higher education and enrollment might counterbalance the arrest history. The belief in God adds a positive factor. Living alone isn't as strong but still present. Drug use is there, but she hasn't felt depressed recently.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium to high risk from education and religion, medium from living situation and drug use, so overall moderate risk with some protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"She has one prior arrest which could indicate past behavior that might lead to similar issues again.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"She has a higher education (associate/junior college) and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college, suggesting she's proactive about her education and may be more likely to change behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate potential instability or substance use issues which are associated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past but hasn't felt depressed recently.
