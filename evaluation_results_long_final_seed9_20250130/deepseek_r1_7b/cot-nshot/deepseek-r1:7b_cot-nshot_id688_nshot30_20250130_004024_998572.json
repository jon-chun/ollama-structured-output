    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the provided risk factors. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. I'd assign this a high weight.\n\nShe completed her associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can be a protective factor, but since she's still in school, it might indicate she's proactive about her future. However, the fact that she has a prior conviction could outweigh the educational progress, so I'd consider this as medium weight.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Living situation can influence recidivism, but without more info on past stability or support systems, maybe it's low impact here.\n\nHolding one job during the year is positive because stable employment often reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So that would be a low weight factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can contribute to underlying issues like addiction, which might increase recidivism if not addressed. This seems medium to high weight depending on other factors.\n\nShe feels no depression in the past month, which is positive as chronic depression can sometimes be a coping mechanism for substance abuse. So this factor leans towards low impact here.\n\nLiving with a household of size 4 at a young age might suggest she had some support, so maybe lower risk. But without knowing if that support included help with substance use or other issues, it's safer to assign it as low weight.\n\nConsidering that God has something to do with her personal matters indicates she may have some level of accountability and support, which could be a protective factor but not the strongest here. So medium weight?\n\nPutting all together: Prior conviction is high, drug use is medium, education is medium, job held is low, living situation low, depression low, family background medium.\n\nI think her prior arrest makes her risk higher despite some positive factors like education and employment. The presence of a prior conviction would likely pull the prediction towards YES.\n</think>\n\n{\"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"While she is currently enrolled in college, having completed associate/junior college may indicate a higher likelihood of completing education and reducing criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held one job during the past year suggests some stability, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Receiving marijuana in the past four years could contribute to substance abuse issues that may influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk unless there are other negative factors like instability or family issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not experiencing depression in the past month suggests she is managing her mental health effectively, which is protective.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Living with a household of size 4 at a young age may indicate some support but without further context on substance use or other issues, it's considered medium risk.\")\n], \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 75}",
