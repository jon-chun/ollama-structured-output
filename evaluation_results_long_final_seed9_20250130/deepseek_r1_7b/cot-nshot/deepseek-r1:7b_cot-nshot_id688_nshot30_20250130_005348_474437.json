    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. The person is a 21-year-old White female with several risk factors.\n\nFirst, her age of 21 might not be too concerning yet, but being in her prime working years could mean she has more responsibilities that could impact her ability to reintegrate after incarceration.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest andConviction. That's a significant factor; recidivism is higher among those with prior convictions.\n\nCompleting associate/junior college and being enrolled in a 2-year college suggests she has some education but might lack stability if her studies aren't leading to employment or are inconsistent.\n\nLiving alone, though not ideal, isn't inherently a risk factor unless there's instability elsewhere. \n\nShe's using marijuana, which is legal and less risky than more potent drugs, so maybe medium risk there.\n\nHer past household size was 4 at a young age\u2014size can indicate family support but doesn't directly correlate with rearrest rates as much as current stability or circumstances do.\n\nConsidering that God has something to do with her personal matters indicates she might be motivated towards positive change, which could lower her risk slightly.\n\nOverall, the key factors here are the prior conviction and education level. The presence of a criminal history is a major red flag for rearrest. Education can sometimes mitigate recidivism if used properly, but in this case, it's completed but not necessarily leading to better opportunities post-release. The other factors don't add much weight; they either neutralize or are minor contributors.\n\nSo putting it all together, the risk is medium because of the prior arrest and education status, despite some positive factors like being White and her personal belief in God.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which places them in their prime working years, potentially making it harder to reintegrate after incarceration but not necessarily a direct risk factor for rearrest itself.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction increase the likelihood of rearrest as recidivism rates are higher among those with criminal history\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Completed associate/junior college and enrolled in 2-year college; education can sometimes mitigate recidivism if used properly but may not directly lead to better opportunities post-release\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone, which is a neutral factor as stability of residence doesn't directly correlate with rearrest rates as much as other factors\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years; drug use can sometimes lead to increased risk of relapse or involvement in criminal activities but not necessarily direct rearrest risk\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Lived with a household size of 4 at a young age; family support can have a mitigating effect on recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Considers God to have something to do with their personal matters; religious involvement may contribute to positive life choices post-release but doesn't directly correlate with rearrest risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
