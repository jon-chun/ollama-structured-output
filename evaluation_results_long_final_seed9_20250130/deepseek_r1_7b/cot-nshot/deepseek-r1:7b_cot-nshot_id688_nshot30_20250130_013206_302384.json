    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given case based on the provided examples and assign weights to each risk factor. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism. So this should be a high weight.\n\nShe completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Completing education can reduce recidivism, so maybe medium weight here.\n\nLiving alone doesn't directly indicate risk, but it's neutral. Maybe low to medium weight depending on other factors.\n\nShe held one job during the year, which suggests some stability, possibly lowering the risk compared to someone not employed. Medium weight.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in past four years and no recent depression. Past drug use can be a risk factor because substance abuse often correlates with recidivism. So high weight here.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age, which might indicate she had family support but could also have other factors like living in an urban or rural area. Neutral to low weight.\n\nConsidering God as part of her personal circumstances doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior; maybe low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), education (medium), living alone (low), job held (medium), drug use (high), household size at young age (low), and spiritual consideration (low). The strongest risk factors are prior arrest and drug use, both high. The positive factors like education balance but aren't strong enough to offset the negatives.\n\nGiven that two high factors point towards higher recidivism, my prediction leans toward \"YES\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the 21-year-old female White case:\n\n- **Prior Arrest and Conviction**: High weight (high) - Prior arrest significantly increases the risk of recidivism.\n- **Education Level**: Medium weight (medium) - Education can help reduce recidivism but isn't a strong mitigating factor here.\n- **Living Alone**: Low weight (low) - Living alone doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless other factors are present.\n- **Employment**: Medium weight (medium) - Employment generally reduces risk, but one job may not be sufficient to completely mitigate it.\n- **Drug Use**: High weight (high) - Past drug use is a strong indicator of potential future substance abuse issues linked to recidivism.\n- **Household Size at Young Age**: Low weight (low) - The household size alone doesn't strongly indicate risk without additional context about living environment or family dynamics.\n- **Spiritual Consideration**: Low weight (low) - This factor is unrelated to criminal behavior and thus has minimal impact.\n\nConsidering the high-weight factors of prior arrest and drug use, which are strong indicators of potential recidivism, along with moderate positive factors like education and employment, but no significant negative mitigating factors beyond living alone. The overall risk assessment leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest due to these key risk factors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"High weight because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism, indicating past criminal behavior which can predict future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight as education completion is a mitigating factor but doesn't fully eliminate the risk.
