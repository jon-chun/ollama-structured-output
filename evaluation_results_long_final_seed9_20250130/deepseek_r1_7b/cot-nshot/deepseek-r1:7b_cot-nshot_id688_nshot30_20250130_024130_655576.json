    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out this case step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old White female. She's been arrested once and convicted. That seems like a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism. So that might be a high weight factor.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. I'm not sure if her weight affects the risk, but maybe being underweight or overweight could sometimes be linked to health issues which might affect recidivism? Not sure about that part yet.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can increase stress and social isolation, both of which are known contributors to substance abuse and recidivism. So this should probably have a high weight.\n\nShe has completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education generally reduces the likelihood of recidivism because it provides opportunities for better jobs and skills. So this could be a medium or low risk factor depending on how recent her education was and if she's planning to use it for positive outcomes.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having some work experience can provide stability, but with only one job, maybe she's still struggling to find steady employment. That might not be as strong of a protective factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) and no feelings of depression recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, is linked to higher recidivism rates because it can lead to impulsive behaviors or more criminal activity. No recent depression isn't necessarily a positive sign either; sometimes substance abuse can co-occur with mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Larger households might offer more support and stability, which could be protective. But if it was a less supportive environment, maybe it's not as strong.\n\nShe believes God is involved in her personal matters. This religious belief can provide moral guidance and may reduce substance abuse or illegal activities, so that's probably a low to medium risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior conviction (high), living alone (high), drug use (high), but education (medium), job experience (moderate), household size (maybe medium depending on support), and religious involvement (low). \n\nThe high factors seem to outweigh the protective ones, so I'd lean towards a higher risk. But considering her being White might have some influence too? Wait, in the examples given, most White females had outcomes that were either YES or NO based on other factors, but without specific data, it's hard to tell. \n\nOverall, her prior arrest is a big red flag. So I think she has a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone is associated with higher stress and social isolation, both linked to substance abuse and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past drug use, particularly marijuana, can lead to impulsive behaviors and is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"While she has completed associate/junior college, the medium weight reflects her potential lack of immediate employment or positive outcomes from education.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Only one job held during the year may indicate instability and less opportunity for long-term gains that could reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Size 4 household might offer some support but without details on living conditions, it's considered a medium factor.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief in Personal Matters\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is associated with lower substance abuse and may provide moral guidance, reducing risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
