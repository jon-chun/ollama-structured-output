    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black male will be rearrested within three years. The case details are quite specific, so I'll go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person has been arrested four times and convicted once. Having multiple arrests is a strong indicator of recidivism because it shows past behavior that could lead to more offenses.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. Weight alone might not be a big factor here unless it relates to substance use, which doesn't seem to be the case since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes reduce support systems that might help him stay sober or avoid criminal behavior, but this isn't always directly linked to recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of recidivism; without a diploma, he might face barriers to better opportunities and could engage in risky behaviors again.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Employment stability can contribute to financial stability, which reduces opportunities for substance abuse or other illegal activities. One job might not be enough, but it's positive compared to no employment.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, but he felt down and couldn't cheer himself up some months. Emotional distress could lead to substance use as a coping mechanism if he doesn't have access to support or resources. This lack of support might increase his risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. Larger households can sometimes provide more supervision but also may not be directly linked unless it's unstable living conditions leading to higher crime rates elsewhere.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal matters. This could affect his motivation towards positive behavior or seeking help if available.\n\nPutting this all together, the multiple arrests and lack of education are strong red flags. The emotional distress without support might push him toward further issues, but he's not using drugs anymore. However, considering past behavior and current circumstances, I think there's a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Repetitive criminal behavior is a strong indicator of future involvement in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"no education background\", \"medium\", \"Lack of educational attainment can increase future recidivism risk due to limited opportunities for positive development.\"),\n    (\"living alone without support\", \"low\", \"Living in a stable environment, even if not married, might provide some protection from immediate influences that could lead to further issues.\"),\n    (\"past emotional distress without coping mechanisms\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of low mood or depression can contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors if not addressed adequately.\"),\n    (\"current joblessness with only one job held in the past year\", \"low\", \"Having a job, even temporary, shows some commitment and could indicate potential for positive change or support if circumstances improve.\"),\n    (\"no drug use but emotional distress\", \"medium\", \"The absence of drug use is a positive sign, but emotional distress might be addressed through other means, potentially reducing risk factors in the future.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
