    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of 4 arrests with convictions. That's pretty significant\u2014higher number of prior offenses usually correlate with higher recidivism. So that's high risk.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. No mention of weight issues or related crimes, so I'll assume this is just his height and weight. Probably not a direct risk factor unless it's connected to something else, but since no info is given, maybe low risk here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate instability, which might be a bit of a red flag, but without other factors like substance abuse or criminal history, this might be medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known predictor of recidivism, so that's high risk.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year. Single job doesn't necessarily guarantee stability if he's facing issues like substance abuse or prior crimes, but one job might be mitigating some risk factors. Maybe medium here.\n\nNo drug use in past four years, but felt down recently. Substance abuse can sometimes lead to self-medication with other substances or alcohol, which is risky. Since he's clean now but had a bad mood, that could still be high risk because of possible underlying issues.\n\nAt a young age, lived in a household size 4. Larger households might offer more support, reducing risk, so probably low here.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life\u2014might indicate a lack of religious support or belief, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism if it's affecting his personal or social connections. So maybe medium-high risk.\n\nPutting all these together: High due to prior arrests, education issues, and possible underlying mental health factors. The job might help but isn't enough without those other issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Arrested 4 times with convictions, indicating a history of criminal behavior which is strongly associated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No information on health or physical status that could correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate potential instability but without other factors like substance abuse, it's not a strong indicator of high risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as educational attainment is often linked to better job prospects and stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job during the year; single employment can contribute to stability but doesn't necessarily mitigate other risk factors like substance abuse or prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Mood\", \"high\", \"No drug use in past four years but felt down recently, which could indicate underlying mental health issues that might correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of size 4; larger households typically offer more support and stability, reducing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence\", \"medium-high\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his life; this lack of religious support can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism if it affects personal or social connections.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
