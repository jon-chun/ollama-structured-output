    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s a solid red flag because prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe's completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can sometimes predict future outcomes, but having ongoing education might actually suggest she's committed to improving herself, which could be a mitigating factor. But since she has a degree, maybe it's more about her current situation than past education.\n\nShe's living alone without any dependents. Living alone doesn't necessarily correlate with rearrest unless there's domestic violence or other issues, but since she's single and not raising children, I don't see an immediate link here. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. drug use can sometimes lead to more serious offenses or strained relationships, but if she's completing school, maybe it's part of her personal growth rather than a direct cause. This is probably medium risk because she's actively working on things that could help prevent future issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household with four people. Larger households might indicate more support and less stress, which could be positive. However, if there were issues at home, it could be negative. Without specifics, I'll lean towards this being low risk since larger families often have more resources to help prevent problems.\n\nShe believes God is involved in her life. That's a strong positive factor because religious involvement can provide moral support and community, reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. So this is definitely high risk reduction.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), ongoing education (moderate), living alone (low), drug use (medium), family environment (low), and spiritual involvement (high). The high factors probably outweigh the medium ones, especially since she's completing college now. I think her chances of rearrest are lower than average but not impossible.\n\nSo, based on these weighted factors, I'd predict a \"NO\" outcome with maybe around 35% confidence because while she has some mitigating factors like education and spiritual involvement, the prior arrest is a significant risk factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She is currently enrolled in college and has completed an associate or junior college degree, which may indicate proactive steps towards betterment affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase rearrest risk unless accompanied by other negative factors like domestic issues, which are not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could potentially influence behavior and decision-making, though ongoing education may suggest a commitment to positive change.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of four people generally provides more support than solitary living but without specific issues, it is considered low risk.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Involvement\", \"high\", \"Believing in God can provide moral guidance and community support, which are positive factors reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
