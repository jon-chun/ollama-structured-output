    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 21 years old. Younger individuals might have different recidivism rates compared to older people who've been in the system longer. But since she's only 21, which is relatively young, I'm not sure how much of an impact that has on rearrest.\n\nNext, number of prior arrests and convictions: She has one arrest and a conviction. That's a significant factor because having a prior conviction increases the chances of getting rearrested again. So this should be high weight.\n\nEducation level: She completed associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so maybe this should have a medium effect since she's continuing her education but hasn't finished yet.\n\nCurrently living alone: Yes, she's living alone. Living in a stable home environment might reduce stress and factors that could lead to substance abuse or other issues contributing to rearrest. So this is probably a low risk factor because living alone can sometimes mean better support systems.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married. Not being married might affect her social support network, but since she's living alone, it's not as much of an issue compared to someone with a partner who might offer help or resources. So maybe medium weight here?\n\nCurrent employment: She held 1 job during the year. Having some employment history can provide stability and skills that may prevent reoffending. However, just one job isn't a lot, so perhaps this should be low weight.\n\nDrug use in past four years: She used marijuana. Past drug use, especially recent, can indicate substance abuse issues which are strong predictors of recidivism. This would probably have a high weight since it's a clear risk factor related to criminal behavior.\n\nHousehold size at young age: Her household was size 4 when she was younger. Larger households might offer more support and less stress, but if she experienced any dysfunction in those relationships, that could be a problem. Since the current household is different, maybe this has low weight.\n\nBelief in God: She considers God has something to do with her personal issues. Religious beliefs can sometimes influence behavior, but it's also possible that having a strong religious support system can aid in staying sober or making better decisions. However, without more info on how active her belief is, I'd give this medium weight.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nPrior Arrests: High\nEducation: Medium\nLiving Alone: Low\nMarital Status: Medium\nEmployment: Low\nDrug Use: High\nHousehold Size: Low\nBelief in God: Medium\n\nNow, considering the examples given, most factors like prior arrests, drug use, and living situation were significant. Her high weight on prior arrests and drug use would lean towards a higher risk of rearrest. However, her education and living alone might mitigate some of that.\n\nLooking at the examples, cases with prior arrests, substance abuse, or living in smaller households often had more influence on the outcome. Since she has one prior arrest, which is a strong indicator, I'm leaning towards a high confidence level for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, significantly increasing the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having completed associate/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college indicates some educational progress but may not provide long-term support which could influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces potential social support, mitigating some of the risk factors associated with living arrangements.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married may affect social support networks compared to those with a partner, but current living situation is more stable.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year provides some stability, though limited employment history may not significantly reduce rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana indicates potential substance abuse issues which are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 at young age might offer support, but current living situation is not specified as problematic.\"),\n    (\"god_belief\", \"medium\", \"Considering God has something to do with personal issues may suggest some support or influence on behavior, though the strength isn't clear.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
