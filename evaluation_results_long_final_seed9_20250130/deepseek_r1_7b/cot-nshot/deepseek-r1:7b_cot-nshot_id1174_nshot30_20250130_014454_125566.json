    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of being arrested four times and convicted once, which is pretty significant. More arrests usually mean more involvement with the criminal system, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. While this doesn't directly impact recidivism much, it might suggest he's an adult living on his own, but since he's 18, that's expected for someone not in a family situation yet.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, which could indicate he's managing without a partner, so maybe lower risk there. But again, this is just one factor among many.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED means he might have had less education, possibly affecting his job prospects and future opportunities. That's a medium to high risk because education often correlates with better outcomes.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college, so similar reasoning applies\u2014lack of formal education can lead to more challenges contributing to recidivism. So this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job experience and stability are important for reducing recidivism. One job might indicate limited opportunities for advancement or support, so that's another medium to high factor.\n\nHis recent feelings of low mood affecting his mood could influence his decision-making. If he's experiencing significant stress or down times, it might impact his ability to reintegrate into society positively. This is a high risk because mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age, which suggests he didn't have extended family support early on. While this doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, it's more about his upbringing and less about his current situation. So maybe low or medium risk here.\n\nConsidering all these factors: high for arrests, education, employment, mood; medium for living alone, household size; low for job experience. The overall assessment would lean towards a higher risk but not extremely so because he's 18 and might be working on building better habits.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, similar cases with multiple high-risk factors like arrests, lack of education, and unstable situations often resulted in 'YES' outcomes. This person has more high factors than low ones, so his recidivism is likely higher.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (4 times, convicted once)\", \"high\", \"High risk due to multiple arrests indicating criminal involvement and potential for future behavior repetition.\"),\n    (\"No diploma/GED, not enrolled in college\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can lead to limited opportunities and may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employed 1 job during the year\", \"medium\", \"Limited work experience might indicate instability or lack of support which could influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Living independently at 18 suggests self-reliance, but other factors like prior criminal history and mood may counteract this.\"),\n    (\"No drugs, mood down for some time\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues can affect decision-making and contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size 4 at young age\", \"low\", \"Younger household might not provide long-term support but isn't directly linked to recidivism as other factors are considered.\"),\n    (\"Black identity, considers God no role\", \"medium\", \"Identity alone doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it's tied to other negative factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
