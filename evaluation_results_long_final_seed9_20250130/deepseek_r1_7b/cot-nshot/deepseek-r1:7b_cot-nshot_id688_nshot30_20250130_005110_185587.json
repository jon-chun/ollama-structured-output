    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors. First, I'll go through each factor one by one.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old female, White, with no prior marriage and living alone. She has an associate/junior college education and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She's held one job, uses marijuana, hasn't felt depressed recently, lived in a household of four at age, and believes God affects her life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I'll assign weights to each factor based on their impact from previous cases:\n\n1. Age: Being 21 is within a typical age range for recidivism, so maybe medium weight.\n2. Education: She has some college, which usually reduces recidivism risk; this could be low.\n3. Employment: One job might indicate stability but isn't directly linked to rearrest; perhaps medium.\n4. Drug use (marijuana): Previous examples with similar factors had mixed outcomes but a positive correlation; maybe high.\n5. Household size at age: Larger households are associated with lower recidivism, so low weight here because she's in a household of four.\n6. Depression: She hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, so medium weight.\n7. Family background (God's role): Believes God affects her life; this might suggest she's motivated towards good behavior, so high.\n\nNow, integrating these factors with the examples:\n- Drug use seems to have a strong impact on rearrest outcomes in previous cases, often leading to YES when present.\n- Household size here is moderate but not low, as it was small (4). The education level being college might lower risk enough to outweigh other negatives.\n- She's White, which generally has lower recidivism rates.\n\nConsidering all these points, the drug use factor strongly suggests a higher chance of rearrest. Other factors like education and living alone could mitigate some risk, but since she has a history of drug use (marijuana), it might tip the balance towards a YES outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The person is 21 years old, which is within the typical age range for recidivism and may not strongly influence rearrest risk on its own but could be a mitigating factor if employed successfully.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college.

Larger households are generally associated with lower recidivism risk, but this factor alone does not strongly predict rearrest without additional information about current living arrangements or family support.\"),\n    (\" Depression in Past Month\", \"medium\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month. This is positive and can contribute to better outcomes by reducing stress levels and potentially improving self-esteem, which may aid in reintegration efforts.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs (God's Influence on Her Life)\", \"high\", \"She believes that God has something to do with her personal life. Religious beliefs often provide moral guidance and can positively influence behavior towards reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
