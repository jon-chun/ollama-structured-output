    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to analyze the given case and predict whether a 21-year-old female will be rearrested within three years based on her risk factors. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the relevant risk factors from the provided information:\n\n1. She has been arrested once and is convicted.\n2. She completed associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college.\n3. She has never been married and is currently living alone.\n4. She held one job during the year.\n5. She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.\n\nNow, I'll compare her situation to the examples provided earlier to determine how each factor contributes to rearrest risk.\n\nStarting with the first example (Example 1), where a similar case resulted in a YES prediction. Her factors included being Black, living with parents, household size of 3, and attending school. In our case, she's White, not living with parents, household size is 4, attending both college and a 2-year program, no recent depression, but has a criminal history.\n\nComparing to Example 6 (Example #6), which resulted in YES: She had similar factors\u2014White, arrested once, living alone, enrolled in school. However, she used marijuana and felt depressed this month. Our case doesn't mention recent depression.\n\nLooking at Example 28, where someone with similar drug use but no recent depression had a NO outcome. So, her current mental health status is a mitigating factor compared to those who are depressed now.\n\nHer education level: She has an associate/junior college degree and is enrolled in a 2-year program. In the examples, higher education was associated with lower recidivism rates (Examples 6,10, etc.). So, this should be a protective factor.\n\nShe's never been married but is living alone\u2014perhaps stable living situation could reduce risk compared to cohabiting or being with family.\n\nShe held one job: Having some work experience might indicate she has skills and might seek employment again. However, her criminal history is significant because prior offenses can increase rearrest chances (as seen in Examples 1,6 where similar cases had YES).\n\nHer household size was 4 when young\u2014larger households sometimes have more support but could also have issues like drug use if not controlled.\n\nConsidering all these factors: Her education and being enrolled in school are positive indicators. However, her past arrest increases the risk. The fact that she's never been married might be a negative since some studies suggest higher rearrest rates among ex-offenders or those with family ties. But here, she's single but living alone.\n\nShe used marijuana before but hasn't felt depressed recently\u2014this is a mitigating factor compared to someone who feels depressed now.\n\nPutting it all together: Her prior arrest and the lack of recent mental health issues are strong factors pointing towards higher risk (YES). The education level and living situation, though positive, might not outweigh the negative influences from her past.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once and is convicted, which indicates a history of criminal behavior that can increase rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"education_and_enrollment\", \"high\", \"She completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which suggests she may have better educational opportunities or support systems to avoid recidivism.\"),\n    (\"single_living\", \"low\", \"She has never been married and is currently living alone.
