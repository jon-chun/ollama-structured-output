    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to predict whether a specific 21-year-old female will be rearrested within the next three years based on her risk factors. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given information about this individual and then compare it with the provided examples to determine the appropriate weights for each risk factor.\n\nShe's a 21-year-old White female. She has one arrest and one conviction. Her height is 6 feet 1 inch, weighing 163 lbs. She's never been married and is currently living alone. She has completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She's held one job during the year. She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. At age 18, she lived with a household of size 4. She believes God influences her life.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided, I need to identify which risk factors are present and their relative weights based on how they influenced similar cases.\n\n1. **Arrests/Convictions**: She has one arrest and one conviction. In the examples, individuals with similar arrest records tend to have higher recidivism risks. For instance, Example 6 had a prior arrest and ended up predicting YES. So this factor should be high weight.\n\n2. **Education Level**: She's enrolled in a 2-year college after completing associate/junior college. Education generally reduces recidivism risk, but since she's continuing her education, maybe it's less impactful now. However, higher education is usually protective, so perhaps medium weight.\n\n3. **Living Alone**: She's living alone, which is associated with higher rearrest rates in examples like Example 15 where living alone led to a YES outcome. So this should be high weight.\n\n4. **Drug Use (Marijuana)**: She used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. In the example with similar drug use (Example 26), she had low recidivism, but since her perception of depression changed, maybe it's slightly less concerning. Still, drug use is a risk factor, so medium weight.\n\n5. **Household Size at Age 18**: She lived in a household of size 4, which was associated with higher rearrest rates as seen in Example 27 where household size contributed to NO outcome but overall it's not the most significant factor here. Maybe low weight.\n\n6. **God Influence**: She believes God influences her life, which is protective compared to examples where belief in God often had lower recidivism (like Examples 19 and 30). So this should be high weight as it mitigates risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest record and education are strong factors pushing towards YES. Living alone increases the risk but isn't the highest factor. Drug use is present but recent change in feelings might reduce its impact slightly. Household size was a contributing factor but not dominant here. Her belief in God adds positive influence. \n\nConsidering these, her overall risk seems to be on the higher side due to prior arrest and living alone, despite other mitigating factors like education and religion. So I'd predict YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has one arrest and one conviction, which are significant risk factors for recidivism as seen in similar cases where prior convictions increased rearrest rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Completing associate/junior college and currently enrolled in a 2-year college slightly mitigates risk compared to those without such education, but it's not the most protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone is associated with higher rearrest rates as seen in examples where individuals living alone had higher recidivism outcomes like Example 15 and 27.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana was a risk factor, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, it slightly reduces the impact compared to previous instances where frequent use led to higher rates as in Examples 26 and 30.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 18\", \"low\", \"Living with a household of size 4 is associated with moderate risk, but not the highest factor compared to factors like prior convictions or living alone.
