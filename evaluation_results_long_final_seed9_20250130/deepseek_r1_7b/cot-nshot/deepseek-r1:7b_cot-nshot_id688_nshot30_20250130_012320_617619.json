    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. The person is a 21-year-old White female who has been arrested once and convicted. She's currently living alone, has completed associate/junior college, enrolled in a 2-year college, held one job, used marijuana, hasn't felt depressed recently, lived with a household of size 4, and believes God influences her life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to assign weights to each risk factor. Being arrested once is significant\u2014high weight. Her living situation alone might not be a strong indicator here since she's in a household of four. Education-wise, both associate/junior college and being enrolled in 2-year college are positive signs, so maybe medium low.\n\nShe used marijuana recently but hasn't felt depressed, which might suggest she's managing her substance use well, so perhaps no high risk there. The household size is 4; sometimes larger households can be associated with higher risk if unstable, but since they're biological parents, it's less likely a strong factor here.\n\nHer belief in God isn't directly related to recidivism unless she's seeking help, which the examples don't show. So probably low impact.\n\nPutting this together: high weight on prior arrest and maybe no other significant factors. She has some positive attributes like education and living with others. Her recent substance use is a minor point without depression.\n\nLooking at the previous outcomes, those with similar factors (prior arrest, education, living alone) had mixed results\u2014some YES, some NO. But considering she's White and from a rural area as in example 30 which was YES... Wait, no, that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, this case doesn't mention rural area. Her household size is 4 with biological parents, so maybe that's stable. So her main risk factors are the prior arrest\u2014high weight\u2014and others don't add significant risk. She has positive factors like education and living in a larger household.\n\nGiven that, I think she might have a low chance of recidivism. But looking at example 30 with similar factors had a YES, but maybe because it's White? Not sure. Alternatively, the prior arrest is her main concern here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the risk of recidivism.
