    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the given case and assign weights to each risk factor based on the examples provided. The person is an 18-year-old Black male with several risk factors. Let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Ages and Demographics**: He's 18, which is quite young, often associated with higher recidivism rates.\n2. **Arrests and Convictions**: 4 arrests and a conviction\u2014multiple offenses can increase the chance of rearrest.\n3. **Height and Weight**: 5'10\"/145 lbs\u2014no direct link to recidivism but age is more relevant here.\n4. **Marital Status**: Never married, living alone\u2014lack of stability can lead to substance abuse or other issues contributing to recidivism.\n5. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED\u2014not enrolled in college\u2014which might indicate lower support system and higher risk.\n6. **Employment**: Held 1 job during the year\u2014limited income could be a stressor.\n7. **Drug Use**: No drugs used, but felt low mood\u2014a possible indicator of mental health issues that can lead to substance abuse.\n8. **Household Size**: Household size 4 at young age\u2014not directly related, but family dynamics can play a role in recidivism later on.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, each factor like multiple arrests, lack of education, living alone, and recent mood issues contribute significantly to higher rearrest rates. The presence of these factors tends to push the outcome towards \"YES.\" \n\nConsidering all these points together, I think this person has a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is associated with higher recidivism rates due to being in the early stages of life where substance abuse and criminal behavior are more common.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests (4) and a conviction suggest a history of criminal behavior that may contribute to future rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which may result in substance abuse or other behavioral issues contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED indicates a lack of support system, which is often associated with higher rates of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held only 1 job during the year; limited income may create stress and economic strain leading to substance abuse or other issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"No drug use but feelings of low mood suggest possible mental health issues that could lead to substance abuse in the future.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Lived with a household of size 4; this may not directly correlate to current living situation or future stability, though family dynamics can be complex.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
