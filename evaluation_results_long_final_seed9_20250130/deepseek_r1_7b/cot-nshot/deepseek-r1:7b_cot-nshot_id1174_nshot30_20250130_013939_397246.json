Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted\u2014high risk because reoffending is more likely after convictions.\nHe's currently living alone\u2014some studies say living alone increases recidivism because there's no one to support him in times of trouble.\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED\u2014this can limit opportunities, making him less likely to get better job prospects which might help in avoiding incarceration.\nHe's not enrolled in college\u2014higher risk if he's not educated and supported.\nHe held only one job during the year\u2014he might have skills that aren't enough for long-term stability.\nHe doesn\u2019t use drugs but feels down sometimes\u2014maybe this could affect motivation or support systems, though it\u2019s a bit contradictory.\n\nLooking at his past living situation: age 18 in a household of four. Maybe family support is present, which is usually good for recidivism. But he's Black and currently not living with biological parents, which might mean less support system.\n\nHis belief that God has no role\u2014might affect his motivation or willingness to seek help.\nThe fact that he feels down but hasn't used drugs yet\u2014it could be a temporary state rather than a long-term issue.\n\nSo combining all these factors: high because of prior convictions and living alone, medium for lack of education and support. But maybe the positive aspect of past family might lower it slightly. \n\nI think overall, with some positives balancing out negatives, but still leaning towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"Receiving multiple prior arrests increases the likelihood of recidivism as it reflects a history of criminal behavior which can be challenging to overcome.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, especially at an early age, may reduce support networks which are crucial for maintaining stability and avoiding further involvement in the criminal system.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"A lack of high school diploma or GED can hinder opportunities for better employment and financial stability, both of which are important for reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Enrollment in college\", \"high\", \"Not being enrolled in college may limit educational resources and skills that could help in finding a positive path and avoiding further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Job experience\", \"medium\", \"Having only one job during the year might not provide enough economic stability or opportunities for upward mobility, increasing the risk of financial stress leading to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs but feeling down could be a temporary state; however, if it leads to substance abuse issues, this would increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Family support system\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of four at 18 suggests some family support, which can provide emotional and practical support that might help mitigate recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief\", \"low\", \"Considering God has no role may affect motivation towards positive change or seeking help, potentially increasing risk through lack of spiritual guidance or support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
