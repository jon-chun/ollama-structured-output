    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by breaking down each factor in the case.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who's White. She's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism. So that's probably a high weight.\n\nShe's completed associate or junior college but is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can sometimes reduce recidivism, especially if it's ongoing, so maybe this isn't as strong a risk factor, perhaps medium.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Living situation alone doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there are other factors like substance use or prior issues. She has no relevant stable relationships here.\n\nHolding one job during the year might suggest some stability, which could lower recidivism risk, so maybe a low weight.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance use can sometimes be linked to higher rearrest rates, especially if it's recent or if she has a history of substance abuse. So that could be medium weight.\n\nLiving with a household size of 4 at a young age might indicate family support, which is protective rather than a risk factor, so maybe low weight.\n\nShe believes God plays a role in her life, which can actually reduce recidivism risk as spirituality and religious involvement are associated with lower recidivism rates. So this should be a low to medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), education (moderate, but she's still enrolled so maybe less impact), living alone without other issues (low), stable job (low), moderate substance use (medium), family background (low), and spiritual involvement (low). \n\nI think the high risk factor is the prior arrest. The rest are mixed. So I'd predict a YES with medium confidence, as one significant risk factor outweighs some protective ones but not enough to be very certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"Prior arrests can significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism as they indicate past behavior that may lead to future criminal actions.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"She is enrolled in college, which might suggest she's seeking better opportunities and could be less likely to reoffend compared to those without education or with interrupted education.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently indicate a high risk of recidivism unless other factors like substance use are present.\"),\n    (\"job held\", \"low\", \"Having one job during the year might suggest some level of stability, which could reduce recidivism risk compared to those unemployed or with inconsistent work history.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_past\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years can be a risk factor as substance abuse is often linked to higher rearrest rates.
