    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. Being a first-time offender might not be too high of a risk since she's already completed her education at an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a two-year college. That suggests she's taking steps to improve her situation.\n\nShe's living alone, which sometimes can indicate she's in a stable environment, but it also depends on other factors like whether she has support networks. She holds one job, so maybe she has some financial stability, but being unemployed for longer periods is a risk factor here.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana, and she hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a significant risk factor because it often leads to unstable behavior or substance abuse issues which might contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe lived in a household of size four at a young age, which isn't necessarily a bad thing unless there were other issues like abuse or neglect. Since she mentions God has something to do with her personal matters, that's a positive sign indicating she may have supportive values and practices.\n\nConsidering all these factors: one arrest, education level, living alone, one job, drug use, recent lack of depression, household size at young age, and belief in God. I think the risk is moderate because while some factors like being in school might mitigate, others like past drug use are still present. So maybe a 60% confidence that she'll rearrest.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for this case:\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: One arrest and conviction may indicate prior substance issues but also shows some commitment to change.\n2. **Education**: Completed associate/junior college and enrolled in a two-year college suggests ongoing efforts toward stability.\n3. **Living Alone**: Living alone at 21 could imply independence, which might reduce risk factors like family support.\n4. **Employment**: Holds one job, providing some financial stability but not a strong indicator of future employment.\n5. **Drug Use**: Past use of marijuana and lack of recent depression are concerning as they may contribute to unstable behavior.\n6. **Household Size at Age**: Size 4 indicates no immediate family issues like abuse or neglect.\n7. **Religious Affiliation**: Believes in God, indicating positive values that could support personal growth.\n\nConsidering these factors moderately suggest a risk of rearrest due to past substance use and other non-factors mitigating the risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"first_arrest\", \"low\", \"Her one arrest and conviction might indicate prior substance issues but shows commitment to change.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Completed associate/junior college and enrolled in a two-year college, indicating ongoing efforts toward stability.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 21 could imply independence which may reduce risk factors like family support.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Holds one job, providing some financial stability but not strong indicator of future employment.\"),\n    (\"drug Use_history\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and lack of recent depression are concerning as they might contribute to unstable behavior.\"),\n    (\"household_size_at_early_age\", \"low\", \"Size 4 indicates no immediate family issues like abuse or neglect at young age.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believes in God, indicating positive values that could support personal growth and stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
