    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted\u2014 that's a high number of prior offenses. From the examples given, higher arrest counts are definitely linked to higher recidivism. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. Weight isn't directly a crime-related factor here, but his age might be relevant since he's only 18, which could mean he's still developing. But in the context of recidivism, this doesn't seem as significant.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone\u2014 living situation can influence recidivism if it's unstable, but being single alone isn't necessarily a strong indicator unless there are other issues like substance abuse or lack of support.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a big factor because people without education might have fewer opportunities to get back into trouble, so this would be a medium risk factor? Wait, no\u2014people without education often end up with longer sentences and more recidivism, so maybe it's high.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year\u2014 job stability can affect recidivism. Unemployment or under employability might increase the chance of getting involved in trouble again, so this could be a medium to high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs but has felt down recently. This is a bit tricky because not using drugs isn't directly related, but feeling low mood can sometimes lead to substance abuse if not addressed. Since he's not currently using drugs, maybe it lowers the risk slightly here, so perhaps medium.\n\nHis household size at a young age was four\u2014 bigger households might have more support or less stress, which could actually be protective. So this factor is probably low risk.\n\nHe says God has no influence on his life\u2014 lack of religious support can sometimes help in recovery if it's not part of the problem-solving. But maybe he's using that as a coping mechanism, so I'm unsure how much this affects recidivism. Maybe medium or low?\n\nPutting all these together: high risk from prior arrests and lack of education. Medium to low from job situation and stable household. The mood issue is neutral here.\n\nSo the overall risk seems high because of the four prior convictions and no diploma. Even though he's living alone, maybe that's not as impactful. So I'd predict a YES for recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities for positive reintegration and may correlate with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"medium\", \"Held only one job, which could be a risk factor if unemployment or underemployment is a contributing factor in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mood/Feelings\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use but felt low mood.
