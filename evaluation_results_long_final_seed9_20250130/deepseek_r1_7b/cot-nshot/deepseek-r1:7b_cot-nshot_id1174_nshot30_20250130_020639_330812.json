    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the relative weight of each risk factor for this particular case. The person is an 18-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted once. He's currently living alone at age 18, which might indicate he hasn't found a stable environment yet.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, so that's another risk factor because educational attainment can be linked to recidivism rates. He's not enrolled in college, perhaps indicating further disengagement from formal education and training. Being 18 and living alone could also mean he hasn't had the chance to build positive life skills or relationships.\n\nHe's never been married, which might suggest he hasn't gone through the typical post-teenage years where relationships can provide support and reduce recidivism risk. His job experience is minimal\u2014he's held only one job during the year\u2014so that could indicate limited income stability and opportunities for growth.\n\nHe says he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. However, his emotional state is described as sometimes feeling down without any indication of substance use beyond that period. His household size at age 18 was four, which might suggest living with older adults or others who could provide support but isn't necessarily a strong protective factor.\n\nHis belief in God not affecting his personal issues could indicate higher levels of anxiety or depression, which are known to correlate with recidivism. Overall, considering all these factors\u2014convictions, lack of education, unstable living situation, job history, emotional state\u2014the risk is fairly high.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor and their relative weights:\n\n1. **Arrests/Convictions**: High - Four arrests indicate a history of criminal behavior that can contribute to recidivism.\n2. **Educational Attainment**: High - Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities for future stability and reduce recidivism chances.\n3. **Living Alone at Age 18**: Medium - Living alone at such an early age might indicate instability, potentially leading to further issues.\n4. **No College Enrollment**: Medium - Not attending college could mean missing out on potential support systems and resources.\n5. **Minimal Job Experience**: Medium - Only one job held during the year may show limited work experience or income stability.\n6. **Drug Use History**: Low - No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator of substance abuse prevention.\n7. **Emotional State**: High - Feeling down without drugs suggests potential mental health issues that can increase risk.\n8. **Household Size at Age 18**: Medium - A household size of four may not necessarily be protective without knowing composition.\n\nConsidering the high number of negative factors (arrests, lack of education, living alone) and moderate positives (no drug use), the overall risk is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"High due to four prior arrests indicating a history of criminal behavior that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Educational Attainment\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities for future stability and reduce recidivism chances.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone at Age 18\", \"medium\", \"Living alone early on might indicate instability, potentially leading to further issues.\"),\n    (\"No College Enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Not attending college could mean missing out on potential support systems and resources.\"),\n    (\"Minimal Job Experience\", \"medium\", \"Only one job held during the year may show limited work experience or income stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator of substance abuse prevention.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Feeling down without drugs suggests potential mental health issues that can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 18\", \"medium\", \"A household size of four may not necessarily be protective without knowing composition.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
