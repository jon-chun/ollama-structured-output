    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old White female. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That definitely points towards recidivism, so that's high risk because prior offenses increase the chance of reoffending.\n\nShe's completed associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year program. Education can sometimes reduce recidivism if it's leading to better opportunities, but since she's already enrolled, maybe this factor isn't as impactful here. Maybe medium risk?\n\nLiving alone by herself might be a bit of a protective factor because isolation can lead to stress or substance use issues, which could contribute to recidivism. So perhaps that's low to medium risk.\n\nShe's using marijuana, and while it's not as severe as other drugs, drug use itself is a risk factor for reoffending in the future. So that would be high risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with a household of size 4. A larger household might indicate more support or less stress, which could slightly lower her risk compared to someone living alone with more people. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nConsidering God is involved affects her mindset and support system at home, which can be positive for stability but might not directly influence rearrest if she's facing similar issues in her current environment. So maybe low impact on this factor.\n\nShe's currently not living with her biological parents or in a foster/adoptive setting, so that\u2019s probably medium risk because inconsistent family environments are often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe holds one job during the year, which is better than nothing but might limit opportunities for support if she gets released. So maybe low to medium risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), education (medium), living alone (low-medium), drug use (high), household size (medium), God involvement (low), current family situation (medium). The strongest factors are the prior arrest and drug use, both high risks. Education is somewhat mitigating but not enough. So overall, her risk seems moderately high for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"high\", \"She has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which may provide future opportunities but does not directly mitigate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can lead to stress or substance use issues, which could contribute to recidivism but this factor alone may not be sufficient to predict rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a known risk factor for reoffending and increased risk of future substance abuse which can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of Entry\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 4 may indicate some support but could also suggest potential instability leading to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"God's Influence on Life\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide stability and support, reducing the likelihood of rearrest compared to individuals without such influence.\"),\n    (\"Current Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a non-parental household or inconsistent family environment is associated with higher recidivism rates but does not directly indicate whether this case will follow that trend.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Having one job during the year provides some stability and economic independence, which can help prevent rearrest compared to those who are unemployed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
