    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user has given me a case of a 21-year-old female who's White, arrested once and convicted, living alone with a 6-foot-1-inch height and 163 lbs weight. She's completed associate or junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college, held one job, used marijuana in the past four years, no depression feelings recently, lived in a household of size 4, and believes God is involved in her life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to assign weights to each risk factor. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst, age: she's 21, which is pretty young but not super low. Maybe medium weight because it's a bit high for some factors but not critical yet.\n\nArrests and convictions: one time, so that's significant. High weight because prior offense history can increase recidivism risk.\n\nEducation level: associate/junior college completed and enrolled in 2-year college. That might be a mitigating factor since she's attending higher education. Maybe low or medium weight depending on the context.\n\nLiving alone: yes, but in the example cases, most are living alone except some. Not sure how that affects it yet.\n\nEmployment: held one job. Having employment can help reduce recidivism, so maybe a lower risk factor. So perhaps low.\n\nDrug use: she's used marijuana. Past four years is a longer period, which could be concerning. Medium weight because it's a recent use but not necessarily severe.\n\nHousehold size: 4 people. Larger households might offer more support, possibly lowering risk. Maybe medium or low.\n\nReligion: believes God is involved. Some factors like religious involvement can have positive impacts on recidivism rates, so maybe lower weight.\n\nPutting this all together, she's got some negative factors but also mitigating ones from education and employment. The arrest count might be a strong indicator. Her belief in God could be viewed positively, perhaps influencing the risk prediction towards not rearresting.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Her age of 21 years is relatively young but not particularly high.
