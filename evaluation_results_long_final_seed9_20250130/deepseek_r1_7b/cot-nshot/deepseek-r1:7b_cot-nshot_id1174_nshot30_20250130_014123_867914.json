    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided risk factors. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black male with a criminal history of 4 arrests and a conviction. That's a high number of prior convictions, which definitely increases the risk of rearrest. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which can be a protective factor as living in a stable environment might reduce recidivism. But considering he has a lot of past issues, maybe it's more about his circumstances than stability.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational barriers often correlate with higher recidivism rates because they can lead to unstable situations or lack of skills necessary for success upon release.\n\nHe held only 1 job during the year, which is another indicator of instability. Employability is crucial; not having a steady job can contribute to substance abuse, legal issues, or other problems that might lead to rearrest.\n\nDespite not using drugs in the past four years, he felt down and couldn't cheer himself up some months ago. This could indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors that aren't addressed, which might affect his ability to function positively post-release.\n\nLiving with a household of size 4 at a young age shows no immediate support system, but as an adult, living alone can sometimes be a sign of independence, though it's not directly tied here. His belief in God influencing his personal issues might suggest he's trying to seek help or has some spiritual backing, which could be positive.\n\nPutting this all together: high risk due to prior convictions and lack of education, medium for living alone but not enough info on support systems, and some factors indicating possible internal stress. The combination suggests a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 4 arrests and a conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest due to established criminal behavior and potential for re-engaging in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone at age 18 may indicate independence but could also be a protective factor depending on circumstances, though it doesn't directly correlate with higher rearrest risk compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college can impede future opportunities and contribute to recidivism by leading to unstable situations post-release.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Only holding one job during the year may indicate limited stability, which could be a risk factor as it might lead to reliance on temporary income or other unstable circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health and Mood\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for some months without any positive activities suggests possible stress or lack of engagement that could affect behavior post-release, though not directly tied to rearrest rates but indicative of potential issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 18\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 may indicate no significant support network, which is generally protective for recidivism risk as it reduces the likelihood of dependency on others for help or resources.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence\", \"medium\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with his personal issues suggests he isn't seeking religious counseling or support, potentially indicating a lack of proactive measures against his challenges.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
