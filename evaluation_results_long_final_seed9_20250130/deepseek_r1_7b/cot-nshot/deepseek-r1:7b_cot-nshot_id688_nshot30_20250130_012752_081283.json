    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through her risk factors one by one based on the examples given.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. Looking at the examples, arrest history is a significant factor. In example #6, someone with similar arrest stats had an outcome of YES, while in example #8, another single arrest resulted in NO. So it seems that having an arrest record might be a medium risk.\n\nShe has completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. More education usually reduces recidivism, so this should probably be low risk. In examples like #10, someone with similar education had a low outcome, contributing to her being predicted as NO.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Many examples show that living alone are less likely to reoffend, so this factor would also contribute to a lower risk\u2014low weight here.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Weight isn't directly mentioned in the examples, but generally, being underweight or overweight isn't a direct risk factor for rearrest. So maybe low impact on her risk score.\n\nUsing marijuana is noted as a drug use. Drug use, especially recent, can be a red flag. In example #26, someone with similar drug use had a YES outcome, while in example #7, another drug user was NO. Since she's only using marijuana and hasn't felt depressed recently, it might not tip the scales too much\u2014maybe medium.\n\nShe has no prior marriages or children. Not being married doesn't directly correlate to higher recidivism, so this factor would be low risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Larger households can sometimes indicate more support and less stress, but it's not always the case. In example #27, someone from a similar household had NO outcome. So maybe low impact here as well.\n\nBelieving in God is noted as having something to do with her personal issues. This might suggest she has some support system or spiritual backing, which could lower recidivism risk\u2014so another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: arrest (medium), education (low), living alone (low), weight (low), marijuana use (medium), no prior family (low), household size (low), and God's involvement (low). The strongest factors are the arrest and marijuana use. \n\nLooking at the examples, someone with a single arrest and moderate marijuana use might have a slightly higher risk but not as high as someone with more issues. So my prediction leans towards NO, but I'm only 60% confident because her main risk is the single arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, which can be a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Completing associate/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college generally reduces the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is typically associated with lower recidivism rates as it may indicate self-reliance or support networks.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight does not directly correlate with rearrest risk based on provided examples.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \" occasional marijuana use can be a moderate indicator of potential substance abuse issues which might influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"No prior marriages or children indicate a stable living situation, reducing the likelihood of substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 is not typically associated with higher rearrest rates as seen in similar cases.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Belief (God)\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may provide some support or guidance, which can lower recidivism risk through personal motivation or community involvement.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
