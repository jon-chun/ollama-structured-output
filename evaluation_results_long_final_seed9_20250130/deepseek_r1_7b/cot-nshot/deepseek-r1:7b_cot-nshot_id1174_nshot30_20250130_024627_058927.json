    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's go through his risk factors one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he has a lot of arrest history\u20144 times with convictions. In the examples, people with multiple arrests had higher recidivism rates. So that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is often a big factor; not completing school can lead to more opportunities for crime, so this is another high factor.\n\nLiving alone might be a mitigating factor sometimes, but in the examples, it wasn't always clear. However, since he's 18, maybe that's still a consideration\u2014maybe medium risk here?\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. That's similar to someone who just started out, so not sure how much of an impact that has.\n\nDrugs: He hasn't used any in the past four years. That\u2019s good because substance abuse can predict recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe felt down during the month, but he hasn't used drugs. Maybe that's related to stress or personal issues, not necessarily linked to recidivism directly. So maybe medium here.\n\nLiving with a household of 4\u2014size might matter; larger households sometimes offer more support, so perhaps this is a mitigating factor\u2014maybe medium risk.\n\nConsidering God has nothing to do with his life\u2014that could indicate lack of spiritual support or belief, which some studies suggest can be associated with higher recidivism. So that's another high factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (high), no diploma (high), living alone (medium), substance-free (low), feeling low but no drugs (maybe medium), household size 4 (medium), and no God involvement (high). \n\nThe positives are the drug use and being substance-free, which would lower the risk. But the negative factors like multiple arrests, lack of education, and personal beliefs all add up to a high likelihood of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of 4 arrests with convictions, which is significantly associated with higher recidivism rates as seen in the examples where multiple offenses led to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"No Educational Qualification\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to limited opportunities and support systems.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone (18 years old)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, especially at such a young age, may not necessarily be a strong mitigating factor but could vary based on additional circumstances which are not fully provided here.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (None in past 4 years)\", \"low\", \"No drug use is a positive indicator as it reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior associated with substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Mental State (Felt down during past month)\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing low mood does not directly correlate with recidivism but may indicate other stressors that could influence behavior indirectly.\"),\n    (\"Household Size 4 (Rural Area)\", \"medium\", \"Larger household sizes can provide more support and stability, reducing the risk of recidivism.
