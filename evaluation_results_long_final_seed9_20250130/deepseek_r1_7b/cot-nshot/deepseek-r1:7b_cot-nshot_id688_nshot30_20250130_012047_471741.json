    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That seems like a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly linked to recidivism. So that would be high weight.\n\nShe has a higher education level with an associate or junior college degree and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This usually indicates better job prospects and lower chances of substance abuse, so maybe medium weight.\n\nLiving alone doesn't seem like a strong risk factor on its own, but combined with other factors, it might have some impact. Maybe low weight.\n\nShe's completed her studies, which suggests she has good skills for the workforce, so that lowers the risk. Medium weight here.\n\nHolding one job is positive because stable employment can reduce recidivism. So medium weight.\n\nHer drug use history (marijuana) over four years isn't a recent issue, but it could still be a concern. Maybe low weight.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed recently, so that's a plus. Medium weight.\n\nAt a young age, living in a household of size 4\u2014though she was 21 when she lived there, which is later. The household size might not have been a significant factor at her current age. So maybe low weight.\n\nShe believes God affects her life positively, so that's a mitigating factor. High weight here because it indicates support and positive outlook.\n\nPutting it all together: high, medium, low, medium, low, medium, high, low, high. I think the overall risk is medium-low to low. But considering her prior arrest and education, maybe she has a slightly lower chance of rearrest. So my prediction would be NO with 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, which significantly increases the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has completed an associate/junior college degree and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which generally supports positive outcomes but may not fully mitigate risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not strongly indicate a high risk of rearrest on its own but can be influenced by other factors like employment or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"She has held one job during the year, which is positive as stable employment often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"Her drug use in the past four years (marijuana) does not directly correlate with recent depression but may still contribute to substance abuse issues that could affect her stability.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"medium\", \"She has not felt depressed recently, which is a positive indicator and can influence employment and living situation choices.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 at age 21 may not have been a significant factor in her current risk factors and recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"high\", \"Her belief that God has an impact on her personal life can provide support and positivity, mitigating some negative influences like substance abuse or stress issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
