    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this specific case. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age: She's 21 years old. In the examples, people who were 21 or younger had either low or medium recidivism rates. So that's a positive sign.\n\nEducation level: She has an associate/junior college degree and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Looking at the examples, higher education levels usually have lower recidivism rates. This would be high weight because her education supports stability.\n\nLiving situation: She's living alone. In some examples, living with family or in shared housing was associated with lower rearrest rates. Living alone might increase stress and could be a medium risk factor.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: She has 1 prior arrest. More arrests generally correlate with higher recidivism rates, so this is a significant risk factor.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana but not cocaine. In the examples, even occasional drug use was linked to higher rearrest rates. This would be high weight because even simple drug use can have negative impacts.\n\nMarital status: She's never married. Marital instability sometimes correlates with higher recidivism, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHousehold size at young age: She lived in a household of 4. Smaller households are often associated with lower recidivism rates compared to larger ones due to more support and less stress.\n\nFaith: She believes in God. Religious factors can sometimes offer support or cope mechanisms, so this is probably low weight.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors seem to be education level (high), prior arrests (high), and drug use (high). The other factors are mixed but lean towards lower risk. Considering that each of these contributes significantly, especially having a prior arrest and drug use, I think her chances of rearrest might be higher than not.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- **High Risk Factors**: Prior Arrests (1), Education Level (high), Drug Use (marijuana)\n- **Medium/Low Risk Factors**: Age (21), Living Alone, Marital Status, Household Size, Faith\n\nConsidering her prior arrest and drug use, despite other mitigating factors like education and living alone with a household size of 4, the high risk factors pull towards a higher likelihood.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"She is 21 years old, which is within the range that shows lower recidivism rates compared to older individuals who may face more life challenges and stress. This factor is low weight.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Completing associate/junior college and being enrolled in a 2-year college indicates higher education attainment, which is typically associated with better job opportunities and stability, thus lowering the risk of recidivism.

This factor has high weight.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana, even occasionally, can have negative impacts on mental health and decision-making, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again. This is a high risk factor as seen in similar cases where drug use correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married might indicate less support network or different life circumstances that could influence substance abuse patterns and other risk factors, thus this is considered medium weight.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of 4 may have provided some level of stability and support during her formative years, reducing the likelihood of significant stressors later on. This factor has low weight.\"),\n    (\"Faith\", \"low\", \"Believing in God can provide emotional support and coping mechanisms that reduce substance abuse and other problematic behaviors, thus this is a low risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
