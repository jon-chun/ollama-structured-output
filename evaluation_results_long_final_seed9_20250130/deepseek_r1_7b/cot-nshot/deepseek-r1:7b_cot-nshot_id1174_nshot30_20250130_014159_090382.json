    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, the case is about an 18-year-old Black male who has been arrested four times and convicted. He's currently living alone at 5 feet 10 inches and 145 lbs without a high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, never married, held one job recently, no drug use but felt down for part of the month, lived with a household size of four, and believes God has no role in his life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to assign weights to each risk factor. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Arrests/Convictions**: He's been arrested four times and convicted once. From the examples, higher numbers of arrests correlate with higher recidivism. So this should be a high weight.\n\n2. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is linked to more rearrests. High weight here.\n\n3. **Marital Status**: Never married might indicate instability, which can lead to substance abuse issues. Medium weight since it's relevant but maybe not as high as others like previous arrests.\n\n4. **Employment**: Held one job in the past year. Employment is a positive factor, so this should be low weight, unless he's unemployed or underemployed.\n\n5. **Drugs**: Never used drugs and felt down for part of the month. No drug use suggests lower risk, but feeling down could relate to mental health issues which aren't directly mentioned here. Maybe medium because sometimes depression can lead to other issues that might affect recidivism rates.\n\n6. **Household Size at Young Age**: Lived with a household size of four when young. Larger families might not necessarily correlate directly, but it's worth considering. Maybe low weight as it's less about current circumstances and more past.\n\n7. **Belief in God**: He says God has nothing to do with his life. Some sources suggest that belief in a higher power can influence behavior towards substance abuse or crime. However, this might not be directly a risk factor but could indirectly affect his situation. So maybe medium weight as it's an additional factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The high number of past arrests and lack of education are the strongest indicators for recidivism. His current living situation is neutral, but his recent feelings of low mood don't directly correlate with rearrest rates. However, belief in God could suggest a more rebellious mindset, which might increase risk slightly.\n\nSo overall, considering the high factors like past arrests and lack of education, along with some lower factors, I think there's a moderate to high chance he'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"High number of prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married may indicate potential instability that could contribute to substance abuse issues but not as directly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held one job recently, which can positively influence employment status and thus reduce rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Drugs\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests lower risk from substance abuse but feelings of low mood may relate to other issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Lived with household size 4 as a youth, which is neutral and not directly a risk factor for current recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with his life may suggest a rebellious mindset which could be a contributing factor but not the most direct risk indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
