    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor from the provided examples.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female identified as White. She has a criminal history with one arrest andConviction. Her weight is 163 lbs at 6 feet 1 inch. She's never married and living alone, which might indicate higher risk due to isolation. She has completed associate/junior college but is enrolled in a 2-year college, so she's still getting education, which could be positive.\n\nShe held one job during the year; having some work experience might help reduce recidivism. Her drug use history includes marijuana, and she hasn't felt depressed recently, though past use can be a risk factor. At age, she lived in a household of four, possibly indicating more stress or dependency on others. She believes God plays a role in her life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, similar cases had varying outcomes based on these factors. For instance, someone with a conviction and living alone often had a YES outcome when other factors were considered moderately positive. However, drug use and household size can swing it either way.\n\nShe's enrolled in college now, which is a good sign as education can reduce recidivism. Her stable situation (living alone but not in a rural area) might be better than previous examples where living with parents or foster care had NO outcomes. The job experience could mitigate some negative factors like drug use and past isolation.\n\nConsidering all these points, the risk factors seem mixed: one conviction is significant, but education, employment, and current stable living arrangements might balance it out enough to predict a low recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"conviction history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a criminal history with one arrest andConviction, which can increase rearrest risk but may be mitigated by positive factors like education and employment.\"),\n    (\"age and household size\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of four at age 21 could indicate potential stress or dependency on others, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"She has completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which may provide ongoing education support and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\" employment history\", \"low\", \"She held one job during the year, which can help maintain stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a potential risk factor that could influence rearrest outcomes.\"),\n    (\"god involvement\", \"low\", \"Her belief in God may provide personal support but does not directly correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"current living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone, though in a presumably stable urban setting, can reduce risk compared to previous examples where similar situations led to NO outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
