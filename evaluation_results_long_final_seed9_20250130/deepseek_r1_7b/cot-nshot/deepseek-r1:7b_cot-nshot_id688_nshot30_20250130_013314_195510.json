    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. Being in custody even once can be a significant risk factor because it indicates past legal issues which might affect their ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. Her weight doesn't immediately stand out as a red flag, but body weight isn't typically a primary factor in recidivism unless there are other health concerns involved here.\n\nShe's never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk of isolation, which might contribute to substance use or other negative behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\n\nShe has completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment is generally positively correlated with lower recidivism rates because education can provide better job opportunities and skills for reintegrating into the workforce.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Employment, especially stable or full-time, is usually beneficial for reducing recidivism as it provides financial stability and purpose.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana from the past four years but no depression in the last month. Drug use can be a strong risk factor because it can lead to addiction, which complicates recovery and increases the chances of future offenses or substance abuse issues leading to more problems.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. A larger household might suggest less parental supervision, especially if she's from a broken home, which could be associated with higher recidivism rates due to instability.\n\nFinally, she believes that God has something to do with her personal circumstances, indicating a strong religious affiliation. This belief can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism as it may provide guidance and stability.\n\nPutting this all together: The factors pointing towards a YES outcome are the arrest history (though once), living alone, drug use, and household size at a young age. These seem to suggest she might be more likely to relapse. On the other hand, her education and current job could mitigate some risk. However, since only one prior offense is noted, which can be significant in predicting recidivism, especially if it's a recent offense.\n\nI'm leaning towards a YES prediction with medium confidence because while there are mitigating factors like education and employment, there are also strong risk indicators that suggest she might experience rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single prior arrest conviction can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may lead to isolation but does not directly correlate with high risk without additional factors like drug use or family issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is a significant risk factor for substance abuse and potential relapse which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of 4 may indicate instability, especially if from a broken home, which correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Educational Attainment\", \"low\", \"Having completed associate/junior college and currently enrolled in a 2-year college is positively correlated with lower recidivism risk due to educational opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Currently holding one job can provide financial stability and purpose, reducing the likelihood of substance abuse or other negative behaviors leading to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
