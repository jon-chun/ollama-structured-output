    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by going through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who's White. She's been arrested once and convicted, which indicates prior criminal history\u2014this could be a significant risk factor because past convictions are strong indicators of future behavior. So that might be a high weight.\n\nShe weighs 163 lbs and is 6 feet 1 inch tall. Her weight doesn't immediately strike me as an issue unless there's something about her health status, but since the examples don't mention physical factors beyond weight, I'll note this as low relevance for now.\n\nNext, she's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence recidivism if someone feels more isolated or has fewer support networks, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level typically correlates with lower recidivism because having a degree can lead to better job opportunities and stable living situations. So this might have a low weight here.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Job experience can be positive, as it shows stability, but if she's unemployed or underemployed, that could be a risk. Since she has one job, maybe medium weight.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana\u2014and no depression felt in the last month. Drug use can lead to substance abuse problems, which might increase recidivism risk because of potential relapse or other related offenses. So this is probably a high weight factor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Household size can affect stability\u2014if it's larger, there might be more stress or less support, but since she's living alone now, maybe this is low relevance unless the instability continued into adulthood.\n\nConsidering that God has something to do with her personal life\u2014this indicates her spirituality and emotional well-being, which could be positive as it shows she has support. So probably medium weight.\n\nNow, looking at all these factors together: prior arrest (high), education (low), living alone (medium), job (medium), drug use (high). The high weights on prior arrest and drug use might pull the prediction towards a higher risk of recidivism.\n\nIn the provided examples, similar cases with high risk factors like prior arrests and substance use often resulted in \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest. So putting it all together, despite some positive factors like education and living alone, the dominant negative factors (prior arrest, drug use) likely make her more at risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can lead to substance abuse issues, potentially increasing the risk of relapse or new offenses.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job may indicate some stability but could also be a risk if it's inconsistent or underexploited.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone suggests independence, which might reduce stress and support-related issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Higher education is associated with better job prospects and reduced recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Size of 4 may indicate some instability but she is now living alone, suggesting current stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
