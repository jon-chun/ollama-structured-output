    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case. Let me start by breaking down all the risk factors mentioned in the problem.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White descent. She's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises some red flags because prior convictions are a significant indicator of recidivism.\n\nShe weighs 163 lbs and is 6 feet 1 inch tall. Her weight isn't an issue here; it's more about other factors like education and living situation. \n\nHer educational background: she has completed associate or junior college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Completing some post-secondary education, especially while enrolled, might indicate better opportunities and less likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates because it may lead to isolation or substance abuse issues.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having a steady job can help in maintaining stability and reducing the risk of criminal behavior, but only one job might indicate lower income support if she faces any issues.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse, especially marijuana, can contribute to higher recidivism rates due to potential relapse or related incidents.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign as chronic depression can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Larger households might not necessarily be bad, but if there's neglect or dysfunction, that could increase risk. The example doesn't mention family issues though.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal situation. That's a strong indication of moral integrity and less likely to contribute to recidivism as opposed to someone who feels disconnected from any higher power.\n\nNow, considering the examples provided earlier, I notice that factors like prior arrests, education level (especially if not completing or if enrolled but not finishing), living situation, drug use, and family environment are significant. \n\nIn this case, her prior arrest and conviction could be a high-weight factor. However, she's making efforts with education and possibly has a stable living situation compared to others in the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, someone with a prior arrest but completing some education and being in college tends to have lower recidivism rates than those with more serious issues like multiple offenses or family dysfunction.\n\nGiven her factors, the presence of prior arrest (high risk) is offset by good educational progress and a stable environment. However, living alone might be a middle factor depending on other supporting factors.\n\nConsidering all this, I think she has a low to medium risk of rearrest. But given that she had one prior offense, it's probably better to lean towards a higher risk. Her education is solid, so maybe her risk is around 50-60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"She completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating ongoing commitment to education which may reduce risk but is not mitigated by this factor alone.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk without other contributing factors like neglect or dysfunction, as indicated here.\"),\n    (\"job held\", \"low\", \"She has held 1 job during the year, which could provide stability and support, reducing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years can contribute to higher recidivism rates due to potential relapse or related incidents.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating positive mental health which reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with a household of size 4 without mentioned family issues suggests stable living conditions which may aid in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"god Belief\", \"high\", \"Strong moral integrity and belief in God can reduce risk as it often correlates with higher personal accountability and lower tendencies towards criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
