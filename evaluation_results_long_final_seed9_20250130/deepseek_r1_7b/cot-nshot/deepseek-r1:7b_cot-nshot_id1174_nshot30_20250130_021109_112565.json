    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. The person is an 18-year-old Black male with several risk factors.\n\nFirst, his age at 18 might indicate he's still developing socially and emotionally, which could contribute to feeling down or depressed. That's a low to medium weight factor because it's more about personal growth than external circumstances.\n\nHe has a criminal history with four arrests and convictions. That's high risk due to past negative behavior affecting his stability and ability to reintegrate successfully. High weight here.\n\nLiving alone suggests he might feel isolated, which can lead to depression or loneliness. Medium weight since living conditions are a significant factor but not the only one.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma, indicating limited opportunities and possibly lower self-esteem. That's medium weight as education is important but other factors also play a role.\n\nNot being enrolled in college further emphasizes his educational challenges, so that's another medium factor.\n\nHolding only one job shows he might have struggled to find stable employment, which can impact future stability. Medium weight here too.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs but feels down occasionally. This could be due to personal issues rather than substance abuse, so low weight.\n\n living with a household of four adds stress and strain, increasing the risk slightly. Medium weight because family dynamics are involved but not the primary factor.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some support or coping mechanism, reducing his risk from this aspect. Low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together, the high criminal history and education issues are the main concerns. While other factors like living situation add to the risk, they're overshadowed by the significant past convictions and lack of education. So overall, there's a high chance he'll be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 18 years old, which may indicate limited life experience contributing to feelings of being out of place or struggling with social interactions.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and one conviction suggest a history of unstable behavior that could impact future stability and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness, which may contribute to depression-like mood but does not solely determine recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate indicates potential challenges in life opportunities and self-esteem, affecting future stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held only one job during the year shows limited income and economic stability, which can be a contributing factor but not the primary risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years suggests no direct drug-related issues, though mood swings could be unrelated to drugs.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18\", \"medium\", \"Lived with household size of 4, which may indicate family stress or financial strain affecting stability.\"),\n    (\"Religion Influence\", \"low\", \"Believes in God, who may provide emotional support reducing this factor's impact on recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
