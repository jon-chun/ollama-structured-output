    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the task is to predict whether a specific person will be rearrested within three years based on their risk factors. The examples given are different cases with various risk factors, so I need to analyze those and see how they might apply to this new case.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the risk factors mentioned in the problem:\n\n- Age: 18-year-old male\n- Arrests: 4 times, convicted\n- Weight: 145 lbs (which is a bit on the lighter side)\n- Height: 5 feet 10 inches\n- Marital status: Never married\n- Living situation: Currently living alone\n- Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n- Employment: Held 1 job during the year\n- Drugs: Never used drugs in past four years; felt down once recently\n- Household at age young: Size of 4\n\nHe also says God has nothing to do with his personal matters.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided:\n\nIn Example #6, a Black male with similar factors (arrested twice, no diploma, living alone) had a YES. But in this case, he's been arrested four times. More arrests are likely linked to higher recidivism risk because there's more history of past behavior.\n\nIn Example #20, another Black male with 4 prior arrests and similar factors (though age is different) had a NO, but the outcome depended on other factors too. It seems that the number of prior arrests can be a strong indicator.\n\nLooking at the other examples, higher prior convictions tend to correlate with higher rearrest rates because of existing criminal history, lack of education, unemployment, and living alone are all known risk factors.\n\nThe person in this case has never used drugs but has felt low mood. This could indicate potential issues, though not directly tied to arrest data. Maybe it's a sign of underlying problems that could lead to future issues.\n\nHis household size at age 18 is 4, which might suggest some instability or higher risk of family dysfunction, possibly contributing to recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the high number of prior arrests (4) and lack of education are strong indicators. His current living situation alone can be a significant risk factor. The fact that he's never used drugs but felt low mood could hint at potential mental health issues or stressors that might increase future problems.\n\nTherefore, despite some mitigating factors like being Black (though in the examples it didn't always predict YES), his history of multiple arrests and current circumstances make me lean towards a high risk. However, since he's 18 and considering his situation, maybe there's some room for lower confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which can be a significant factor in recidivism as younger individuals may face more challenges or have different life experiences.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and convictions significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, which can lead to lower educational attainment and potential employment issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Held only one job during the year; unemployment or underemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drugs\", \"low\", \"Never used drugs but felt down recently; while not directly linked to arrest, this could indicate underlying mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Currently living alone can be a significant risk factor due to potential isolation and increased stress.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 18\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of size 4; family dysfunction or instability at a young age may contribute to recidivism but is not the sole determinant.\"),\n    (\"God's Influence\", \"low\", \"Believes God has no role, which might indicate a focus on self-reliance but could also suggest potential mental health issues affecting behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
