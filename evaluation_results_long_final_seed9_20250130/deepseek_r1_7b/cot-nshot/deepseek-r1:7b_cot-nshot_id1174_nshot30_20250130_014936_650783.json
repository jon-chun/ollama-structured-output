    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of being arrested four times and convicted once. That's a pretty significant number of convictions, which usually increases the likelihood of rearrest. I think this should be a high-risk factor because prior Incivis is a strong indicator of future behavior.\n\nNext, his weight is 145 lbs at 5 feet 10 inches, but since he's an adult, that might not directly relate to recidivism unless there are other health issues involved. I'll note this as low risk for now.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect mental health, so if he's feeling down a lot, maybe that contributes to higher risk. So possibly medium or high?\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a key factor in recidivism; not having a diploma might make him more likely to engage in similar behavior again. That sounds like a high-risk factor.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job stability can impact financial stability and thus the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or returning to incarceration. Unstable employment often correlates with higher recidivism, so this should be medium to high.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is positive. Not using drugs reduces the chance of using them again, so that's a low risk factor here.\n\nHe mentioned feeling down during the past month, which might indicate some level of mental distress or substance abuse. This could lean towards medium or high risk because it suggests internal issues that might lead to further problems.\n\nLiving with a household size of four in his youth\u2014though he's an adult now\u2014he was raised in a household of four, but I'm not sure how that affects current recidivism rates unless there's a history of family dysfunction. Maybe low or medium risk depending on other factors.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal issues, which might influence his motivations and responses to stressors. If he doesn't have a strong belief system supporting him, it could increase his likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. So that's probably high risk.\n\nPutting all these together: four prior arrests (high), no diploma or GED (high), living alone (maybe medium depending on other factors), and feeling down (medium). The lack of drug use is a positive, but the other factors are strong negatives. I'm leaning towards high confidence that he'll rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Incivis\", \"high\", \"His four prior arrests and one conviction significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED, combined with not being enrolled in college, makes him more likely to engage in risky behaviors again.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability but may vary based on other factors like support networks.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for much of the past month could indicate internal issues that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium\", \"Held only one job during the year, which can affect financial stability and willingness to engage in criminal activities again.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the likelihood of relapse or increased risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Household size at youth was four; however, this is not directly indicative of current recidivism risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with his personal issues may influence his motivation and response to stress, increasing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
