    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by carefully going through each factor in the provided case and see how they compare to the examples from the previous n-shot cases.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black male with a criminal history of 4 arrests and convictions. That's quite significant because more arrests usually indicate higher recidivism risk. Looking at example #26, someone with similar factors (arrests, living alone, no diploma) had a YES outcome.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which is a red flag for substance abuse or domestic issues, as seen in examples where living situation was similar and they ended up rearrested. In example #19, someone living alone also got a YES.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED adds to the risk because education can influence job opportunities and stability. Comparing with example #26 again, this factor contributes to higher chances.\n\nHe's never been married, which might indicate past issues that could affect his current behavior, as in example #15 where similar factors led to a YES.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs but has felt low during the month. This could suggest potential substance abuse issues, but since he didn't use drugs before, maybe it's a less direct factor compared to others like prior arrests or living situation.\n\nConsidering his young age at 18 might mean he doesn't have much life experience yet, which can be both positive and negative. However, in example #30, someone of similar age with more factors had a YES outcome.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 4 as a youth. Larger households often have more support systems, but if the parents were not involved, it might indicate instability. In example #29, someone living with his biological mother in a smaller household had a NO outcome, so maybe that's different here.\n\nHis belief in God could be a mitigating factor, but since he felt down during the month, perhaps indicating personal issues. This is somewhat variable and less directly tied to recidivism compared to other factors.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrest records, living alone, lack of education, never married\u2014all these points are strongly indicative of higher risk for rearrest. The fact that he hasn't used drugs but feels low might be a minor factor without a clear link in the examples provided.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, the individual has several risk factors that point towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. These include multiple prior arrests and convictions, living alone, lack of education, and never being married. The fact that he hasn't used drugs but felt low during the month is less significant compared to other factors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history (4 arrests)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions significantly increase the risk of rearrest as seen in similar cases with high recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which may result in substance abuse or domestic issues that contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"A lack of education often limits job opportunities and stability, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"never been married\", \"medium\", \"Not being married could indicate past issues that might affect current behavior but is not a direct indicator compared to other factors like prior arrests.\"),\n    (\"has never used drugs (but felt low during month)\", \"low\", \"The absence of drug use, though accompanied by feelings of low mood, may not directly correlate with higher recidivism risk without evidence of substance abuse issues in previous months.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
