    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether a specific 21-year-old White female will be rearrested within three years. Let's break down her risk factors based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, she has one prior arrest and is convicted, which is a high risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism.\n\nShe's completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college\u2014this might be a medium factor since education typically reduces recidivism, but being still enrolled could mean she\u2019s motivated to change.\n\nLiving alone doesn\u2019t seem like a risk factor; it's actually protective. So this would probably have a low weight.\n\nHer job history is only one held job during the year\u2014not a strong indicator on its own, so maybe medium or low.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years\u2014substance use can increase recidivism, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, it might be less severe. Still, drug use could be considered a medium factor.\n\nHer household size at age was 4\u2014size alone isn\u2019t a strong indicator unless it's very large or very small, so probably low.\n\nConsidering God as a positive influence is a protective factor, maybe reducing her risk slightly\u2014so perhaps low.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest (high), education (medium), living alone (low), job history (low), drug use (medium), household size (low), and positive spiritual aspect (low). \n\nPrior arrest is the biggest risk, so even with other factors, the high weight on that would likely push her into a YES outcome. I'm going to say 75% confidence because while she has mitigating factors like education and living alone, the prior arrest is significant.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the case:\n\n1. **Prior Arrest and Conviction (High)**: The individual has one prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest due to established criminal history.\n\n2. **Education and College Enrollment (Medium)**: Completion of associate/junior college and enrollment in a 2-year college is protective but not sufficient to outweigh the high risk from prior convictions.\n\n3. **Living Alone (Low)**: Living alone is generally protective, but without other mitigating factors, it does not significantly reduce the risk.\n\n4. **Job History (Medium)**: One job held during the year may indicate some stability, but no strong evidence of recent employment success or duration beyond a single job.\n\n5. **Drug Use (Medium)**: Past use of marijuana is associated with higher recidivism rates. However, the lack of recent feelings of depression may suggest reduced risk from drug use in the present.\n\n6. **Household Size at Age (Low)**: Household size was 4 at age 21\u2014no direct correlation with rearrest based on this factor alone.\n\n7. **Spiritual Influence (Low)**: Considering God as a positive influence is protective but does not completely negate the risk factors present.\n\n**Prediction**: The high weight of prior arrest and conviction, combined with moderate risk factors from education, job history, and drug use, leads to a prediction of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest due to established criminal history.\"),\n    (\"education_college_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Completion of associate/junior college and enrollment in a 2-year college is protective but not sufficient to outweigh the high risk from prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally protective, but without other mitigating factors, it does not significantly reduce the risk.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"One job held during the year may indicate some stability, but no strong evidence of recent employment success or duration beyond a single job.\"), \n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana is associated with higher recidivism rates.
