    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. The person is a 21-year-old female who's White. She has one arrest andConviction, weighs 163 lbs, 6 feet 1 inch tall. She's never married, living alone. She has an associate or junior college degree and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She worked one job last year. She used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. At age young, she lived with a household of size 4, and she believes God affects her life.\n\nFirst, I should list all the risk factors from the examples provided to understand their impact on recidivism. Looking at the previous cases:\n\n- Age: The older someone is, generally lower risk.\n- Arrests and convictions: More leads to higher risk.\n- Education level: Higher education might reduce risk if it's complete or ongoing (here she has a degree).\n- Employment: Holding a job can help with stability, so her employment here is medium.\n- Drug use:Marijuana use in the past four years. Past drug use sometimes correlates with higher recidivism but recent use may mitigate.\n-Living situation:Living alone vs household size\u2014size 4 might have some factors.\n-God's involvement: Belief can vary; if it's a strong support, maybe reduces risk.\n\nNow applying these to the current case:\n\nAge 21 is relatively young, which is good. One arrest andConviction\u2014so that's medium risk because prior offense increases chances.\n\nShe has an associate/junior college degree (probably completed) and is in a 2-year program. Education can reduce risk if it's ongoing but since she holds a degree, maybe lower risk than someone with less education.\n\nLiving alone might be a bit of a risk factor depending on support network, but at household size 4, maybe manageable.\n\nEmployed one job\u2014good for stability, so medium effect.\n\nDrug use: Past marijuana use. If it's in the past four years, that could indicate she was using, which might have contributed to prior issues or stress, increasing risk.\n\nBelieves God affects her life\u2014so maybe some support and could reduce risk slightly.\n\nPutting these together:\n\n- Arrests/Convictions (medium): High risk\n- Education (completed associate/junior college and in 2-year program): Low risk\n- Drug use (past four years marijuana): Medium risk\n- Employment: Medium\n- Age: Young, so low risk\n- Living situation: Household size 4\u2014probably medium to high risk depending on support.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the highest individual risk comes from the arrest andConviction. However, her education is a positive factor that might lower this risk enough to offset it. The drug use could be a moderate risk but maybe not as significant as prior convictions.\n\nSo overall, considering the balance between positive factors (education) and moderate negatives (arrests, mild drug use), I'd lean towards NO for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 21 years old, which generally indicates a lower risk of rearrest compared to older individuals who may face age-related challenges.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest andConviction increase the risk of recidivism.
