    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who has been convicted once for minor charges like marijuana use. Being arrested and having a criminal record usually increases the risk of recidivism because it shows past behavior that could be problematic again.\n\nShe's completed associate or junior college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year program. Education level can sometimes predict lower recidivism, but since she's actively going to school, maybe there's some mitigating effect here.\n\nShe's living alone, which might reduce the chances of family support helping her if something goes wrong. Living with someone else could provide emotional or practical help during tough times.\n\nShe has held one job in the past year. Having a job can contribute to stability and financial independence, which are positive factors that lower recidivism risk.\n\nHer drug use is only marijuana, and she hasn't felt depressed recently. While drug use itself isn't directly tied to recidivism unless it leads to more issues like further substance abuse or criminal behavior, her recent lack of depression might suggest she's in a better mental state.\n\nShe lived with a household size of 4 at a young age. Larger households can sometimes offer more support and stability, which might actually be protective against recidivism.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her personal issues could either be a strength or a barrier. If it provides guidance and motivation, it's positive, but if she feels unsupported by her faith, it might be a hindrance.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest history is significant (high risk), education plus ongoing studies might have some protective effect (maybe medium). Living alone could increase risk (medium). One job is good for stability (low). Drug use only marijuana and recent mental state are mixed but not directly pointing towards high risk. Family background at a young age is somewhat protective (low).\n\nConsidering all these, I think the overall risk might be on the higher side because of the prior arrest and lack of family support despite education and job.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor:\n\n1. **Prior Arrest**: High - A single conviction can predict increased recidivism.\n2. **Education Level**: Medium - While education is positive, ongoing college enrollment might indicate lower stability.\n3. **Living Alone**: Medium - Living alone could reduce family support during tough times.\n4. **Employment**: Low - Having a job shows some level of stability and independence.\n5. **Drug Use**: Low - Drug use only for marijuana doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless leading to further issues.\n6. **Family Background**: Low - A household size of 4 might offer some support, but it's not as protective as smaller households.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the risk appears high due to the prior arrest and living situation despite other mitigating factors like education and employment.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"A single conviction history increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_and_college\", \"medium\", \"While holding a degree is positive, ongoing enrollment might indicate less stability\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce family support during challenging times\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having a job shows some level of independence and stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Drug use only for marijuana doesn't directly correlate with recidivism risk unless leading to further issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Household size of 4 might offer some support but isn't as protective as smaller households\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
