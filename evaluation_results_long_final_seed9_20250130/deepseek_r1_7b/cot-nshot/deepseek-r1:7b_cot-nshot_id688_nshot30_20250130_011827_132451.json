    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each risk factor step by step based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young but maybe not a strong indicator of recidivism yet. She's White, and being White doesn't directly correlate with recidivism rates unless there are systemic issues, which I don't have data on here. So that factor might be low impact.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. That definitely puts her at risk because prior convictions increase the likelihood of rearrest. Looking at the examples, people with even one conviction often had higher chances of recidivism, so this is probably high weight.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, which isn't unusual, but again, doesn't indicate anything on its own. Weight is 163 lbs; that's within a healthy range, so no issues there. She's living alone, which might mean she has fewer support networks reducing her risk of reoffending. But in the examples, some people living alone still had high recidivism rates, so maybe it's medium.\n\nShe went to an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Completing education can help with job opportunities and stability, but she's already enrolled, which might suggest she's motivated. However, sometimes being in school can lead to substance use or other issues, so the weight here might be medium.\n\nShe's never been married, so no family support system for potential issues. She held one job during the year; job stability is good, but maybe not enough if there were issues with that job. In examples, people with a job had lower recidivism rates, so this could be low impact unless the job was problematic.\n\nDrug use is only marijuana in the past four years.Marijuana use isn't as severe as harder drugs, and she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate better mental health. In the examples, some with drug use had low outcomes, so maybe medium weight here.\n\nShe's lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Larger households can sometimes provide more support, but if there were issues like neglect or abuse, it could be different. Since no other factors point towards high risk from this, perhaps medium impact.\n\nHer belief in God is that it affects her personal experiences. If she's religious and finds support in that, maybe lower risk, so low weight for that factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), job held (low to medium), education (maybe medium). The rest are neutral or moderate factors. Given the prior conviction, I'd lean towards high confidence of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"This individual has a prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.
