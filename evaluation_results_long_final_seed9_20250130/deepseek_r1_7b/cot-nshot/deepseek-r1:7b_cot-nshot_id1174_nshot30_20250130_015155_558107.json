    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male based on the given risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young. Young adults often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and decision-making abilities. So that might be a high or medium risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times and convicted, so that's a significant number of prior convictions. Each prior conviction increases the likelihood of rearrest, especially at such a young age. That would probably be a high risk factor.\n\nHis weight is 145 lbs, which I assume is okay, but his height is 5'10\", which isn't particularly tall or short. Not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nHe lives alone and has never been married. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk of substance abuse or other issues that could lead to rearrest. That might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, so he's likely in the system for not completing education, which is a known predictor of recidivism. That would definitely be a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any job during the past year, which could indicate unemployment issues. Unemployment can lead to financial stress and substance abuse, both of which are linked to higher rearrest rates. So that's another high risk factor.\n\nHe feels down sometimes but hasn't used drugs in the past four years. The fact that he's not using drugs is positive, so maybe a low risk from that aspect. However, his mood can sometimes be indicative of underlying issues. But since he's not using drugs, it might balance out to medium or low.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Household size can affect stability and support, but with four people, it's probably okay. Maybe a low risk from that factor.\n\nHis belief in God is that it has nothing to do with his personal issues. That might suggest he's more likely to focus on other factors, which could be positive, so maybe a low or medium risk here.\n\nPutting all these together: high because of prior convictions, lack of education, living alone, unemployment, and age. The drug use is good but the other factors are strong negatives.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has multiple risk factors that contribute to a higher likelihood of rearrest. Prior arrests and convictions increase the chances significantly, while his lack of education and employment history also play a role. Despite not using drugs, the combination of these factors suggests a high risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is a significant factor in recidivism due to developmental aspects.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and one conviction significantly increase the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can correlate with substance abuse issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a known predictor of higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Not holding a job during the past year could indicate unemployment, which often correlates with substance abuse and other issues that lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"He has not used drugs in the past four years, which is positive as drug use can be a significant contributor to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18\", \"low\", \"Living with household members may indicate stability and support, though size alone does not determine risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"His belief that God has nothing to do with his personal issues could suggest a focus on other factors which might be positive but does not directly correlate with lower risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
