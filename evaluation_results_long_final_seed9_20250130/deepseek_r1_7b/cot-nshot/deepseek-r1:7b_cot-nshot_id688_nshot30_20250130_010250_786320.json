    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to predict whether a 21-year-old female White individual will be rearrested within three years based on her risk factors. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors provided in the case:\n\n1. She has been arrested once and convicted.\n2. She completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college.\n3. She has never been married and is currently living alone.\n4. She held one job during the year.\n5. She used marijuana in the past four years.\n6. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month.\n7. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 4.\n8. She believes that God has something to do with her personal experiences.\n\nNow, I need to assign weights (low, medium, high) to each factor based on their impact on recidivism risk and then use these to predict the outcome.\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: Being arrested once is a significant red flag. It indicates past behavior that could lead to reoffending. This should be a high weight.\n2. **Education Level**: She's enrolled in college, which generally correlates with better job prospects and lower recidivism risk. This might actually reduce risk, so low weight.\n3. **Marital Status/Living Alone**: Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or isolation leading to substance use. However, since she's never been married, it's a bit different. Medium weight because it's a factor but not the most critical.\n4. **Employment**: Having one job suggests some stability, which is positive. However, if it's just part-time or temporary, maybe lower risk. So medium weight.\n5. **Drug Use (Marijuana)**: Past drug use can be directly linked to substance abuse issues, which are known to increase recidivism. High weight.\n6. **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed might indicate she's managing her situation well, but if she had severe mental health issues that led to substance use, this could change. Since it says she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe low impact. But it's a bit tricky, so medium.\n7. **Household Size at Young Age**: Living in a household of four might have contributed to higher risk behaviors or instability. Medium weight as it's an indicator but not the most direct factor.\n8. **Religion Influence on Life**: Believing in God can provide moral guidance and may influence positive behavior, potentially reducing risk. This is somewhat mitigating, so low.\n\nNow, combining these factors:\n\n- High weight factors (most influencing): Arrest Record (high), Drug Use (high). These are strong indicators of potential recidivism.\n- Medium: Education, Employment, Household Size, Marital Status.\n- Low: Mental Health, Religion Influence.\n\nSince she has a recent arrest and drug use history, these are the biggest red flags. The education and employment might mitigate some risk, but her current substance use could be a significant factor pushing towards higher recidivism risk. Her lack of recent mental health issues is positive, but the arrest and drug use are more concerning.\n\nTherefore, considering all factors, especially the high weight ones, it's likely she has a higher chance of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant indicator of potential recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Completing an associate/junior college and being enrolled in a 2-year college may suggest some educational stability, but this does not directly correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is associated with higher crime rates or isolation issues, which can sometimes lead to substance use problems.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Having one job during the year provides some stability but does not necessarily protect against rearrest if other factors like substance use are present.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is directly linked to substance abuse, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests she might be managing her situation well, but this doesn't negate past issues that could relate to substance use.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 4 may have contributed to higher risk behaviors or instability in the past.\",\n     \"Religion Influence on Life\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with her personal experiences can provide moral guidance and may influence positive behavior, which somewhat mitigates risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
