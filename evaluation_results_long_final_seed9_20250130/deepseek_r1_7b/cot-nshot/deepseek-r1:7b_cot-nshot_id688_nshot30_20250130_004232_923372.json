    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female based on her risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a moderate risk because being in custody can increase chances of reoffending. So that's a medium weight.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college. That's actually a positive sign since higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism. Maybe this factor isn't as heavy, perhaps low or even neutral.\n\nLiving alone doesn't seem to be a risk factor; it might even help avoid living situations that could lead to more issues. So maybe no weight here.\n\nShe completed an associate/junior college and is in a 2-year program. Education level usually lowers the risk of recidivism, so this should have low or no impact on her risk factors.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job stability can help with financial independence and reducing re-arrest chances. So probably low weight here too.\n\nDrug use: she's been using marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use isn't a strong indicator of recidivism unless it leads to more serious substance issues or other problems, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nLiving with household size 4 is neutral; without knowing specifics about the family environment, it's hard to gauge if that's a risk factor.\n\nShe believes in God. That's generally seen as a protective factor against recidivism compared to those who don't have religious support.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest record and lack of education are moderate risks, but other factors like education and job stability suggest lower risk. Since she's convicted once, that's the biggest red flag here. So despite some positive factors, her main risk is from prior conviction. \n\nTherefore, I would predict a low probability of rearrest. Maybe 20% confidence because while there are mitigating factors, the prior arrest and possible unstable living situation (though not directly related) might slightly influence it.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor's impact, here is the evaluation:\n\n- **Arrest Record**: Medium risk due to past conviction but no further information on re-arrest from this source.  \n- **Education Level**: Low impact as higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.  \n- **Living Alone**: No significant impact; living situation alone doesn't directly correlate with higher risk without additional context.  \n- **Enrolled in College**: Neutral factor, as enrollment itself isn't a risk factor but can be mitigated by job opportunities.  \n- **Job held**: Low to no impact since having a job is often protective against re-arrest due to financial stability.  \n- **Drug Use**: No significant impact unless it leads to more serious issues, which doesn't apply here.  \n- **Household Size**: Neutral; size without family composition isn't indicated as a risk factor.  \n- **Religious Belief**: Protective against recidivism compared to those without religious support.\n\n**Prediction**: The primary risk comes from the prior arrest record (Medium). While other factors suggest lower risk, the conviction is a significant point. Therefore, the predicted 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome is NO with high confidence due to mitigating factors outweighing the main risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"A past conviction increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Higher education typically correlates with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"no impact\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Enrolled in College\", \"neutral\", \"Enrollment itself is neutral unless it relates to job opportunities or stability.\"),\n    (\"Job held\", \"low\", \"Having a job provides financial stability and reduces re-arrest risks.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"no significant impact\", \"Marijuana use without serious issues does not strongly indicate higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"neutral\", \"Without family composition, size is neutral in this context.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"protective\", \"Belief in God is protective against recidivism compared to those without support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
