    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on provided risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. She has one arrest and a conviction, which immediately raises concerns about past criminal behavior. Generally, having a criminal history can increase the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. Body weight isn't typically a direct indicator unless combined with other factors like living situation or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone is associated with higher recidivism rates because it can lead to isolation and substance abuse issues, which are risk factors we've seen in the examples.\n\nShe has completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment usually correlates with better job prospects and lower recidivism, but since she's still in college, maybe her motivation isn't as high? Or perhaps she's using it as a stepping stone.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job experience can be positive if stable, but unemployment or underemployment might increase risk. Since she's currently living alone, maybe she's struggling to find gainful employment.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is mentioned. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further legal issues and health problems.\n\nShe's never felt depressed recently, which might indicate better mental health or personal circumstances that could mitigate some risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Larger households at younger ages are often associated with higher crime rates due to various social and economic factors.\n\nConsidering her faith (God has something to do) suggests she may have support systems at home, which might lower recidivism risk compared to those without such support.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n1. Arrests/criminals: High weight because past behavior is a strong indicator.\n2. Body stats: Low to medium, as body size alone doesn't predict much unless combined with other factors.\n3. Living situation: High, especially living alone and in a household of 4.\n4. Education: Medium; while education can help, being still enrolled might not show significant impact yet.\n5. Employment: Maybe low or medium because only one job is held, but if it's stable, could be positive.\n6. Drug use: High risk factor, so high weight.\n7. Depression: Low since she's not feeling depressed recently.\n8. Household size at young age: High, as it relates to higher recidivism rates.\n9. Faith: Low because it indicates support which might mitigate some risks.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors that increase the risk (high or medium weight) are high: arrest history, living situation, household size, drug use, and past criminal record. The positive factors (low weight): education in progress and maybe employment stability.\n\nGiven these, I'm leaning towards a higher probability of rearrest. However, her educational pursuits might offer some resilience. My confidence is moderately high because most risk indicators point to recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Criminals\", \"high\", \"The individual has a criminal history which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone, especially in a household of size 4, is associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential isolation and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is a known risk factor for further criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of size 4 during early adulthood can contribute to higher crime rates due to social economic factors.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"While she has completed associate/junior college, being enrolled in a 2-year college might not yet show significant impact on employment or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Faith\", \"low\", \"Her belief in God may provide support and resilience against criminal behavior and rearrest.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
