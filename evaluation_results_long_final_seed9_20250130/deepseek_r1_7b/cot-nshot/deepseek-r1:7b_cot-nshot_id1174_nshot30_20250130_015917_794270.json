    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case. Let's start by going through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: He's an 18-year-old male. Generally, younger individuals have a higher chance of reoffending because they're still developing their skills and making decisions. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nArrests and convictions: He has been arrested 4 times and convicted. More arrests usually mean a history of criminal behavior, which increases the likelihood of rearrest. That's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can lead to unstable situations and higher propensity to engage in illegal activities. High risk here too.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone with no prior marriage. Living alone doesn't necessarily mean he has any issues, but it's also a medium risk because he might be more vulnerable if something happens.\n\nEmployment: Has held only 1 job during the year. Unemployment can lead to stress and potentially substance abuse or other negative behaviors that could contribute to recidivism. Medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: No drugs used in the past four years, so that's a good sign. Drug-free individuals often have better life outcomes. But he felt down sometimes, which might be due to other issues, but since he doesn't use drugs, it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHousehold size at young age: Lived with a household of 4 when young. Larger households can sometimes mean more support and fewer family influences that could lead to delinquency. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nReligion/faith: He considers God nothing relevant to his personal issues, which might suggest he doesn't seek support in his personal struggles, potentially leading to isolated problems. Medium risk because lack of religious support might mean less emotional support or guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: High risks from age, arrests, and education. Medium from living alone, job, and household size. The drug use is a good sign but the other factors are still problematic. So overall, I think there's a high probability he'll be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"18-year-old males typically have a higher risk of reoffending due to developmental stages and decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college can lead to unstable situations and higher propensity for illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk but may make him more vulnerable if circumstances change.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year could indicate unemployment, leading to stress or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drugs used in the past four years is a positive sign, reducing direct drug-related risk but he may experience other underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived with a household of size 4 when young might indicate some support or lack thereof, which could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religion/Faith\", \"medium\", \"Considering God has nothing to do with his personal issues may suggest he lacks emotional support or guidance in dealing with problems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
