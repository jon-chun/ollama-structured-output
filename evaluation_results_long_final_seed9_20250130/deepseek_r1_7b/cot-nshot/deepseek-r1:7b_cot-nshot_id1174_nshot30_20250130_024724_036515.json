    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out this recidivism prediction for the given case. So, first, I need to go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nThe person is an 18-year-old Black male with a lot of arrest history\u20144 times convicted. That's definitely a high risk factor because past convictions are strong indicators of future criminal behavior. Next, he's only 145 lbs at 5'10\", which doesn't immediately ring a bell as an indicator, but maybe it's more about his weight relative to his height.\n\nHe's never married and living alone\u2014living situation can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism rates if there's no support system. He lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college\u2014that's low educational attainment, which is a known risk factor for not getting support or opportunities.\n\nHe held only 1 job during the year\u2014it might show some level of stability, but it could also mean limited skills or no income support. No drug use but felt very down sometimes\u2014mood swings can affect mental health, which in turn affects job prospects and overall stability.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 4\u2014he was raised in a multi-person setting, so maybe that's not as bad as living alone or with fewer people. His belief in God might help him stay positive, but if he feels down sometimes, it could indicate other issues affecting his mindset.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided, when someone has multiple high risk factors like high arrest history, lack of education, and living alone, their outcome tends to be YES more often than not. For instance, example 26 had similar factors and resulted in a YES. The person here also has some high factors but no recidivism examples with low or medium.\n\nConsidering all these, I think the risk is high because of the multiple past convictions and other contributing factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high_arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Past arrests significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.
