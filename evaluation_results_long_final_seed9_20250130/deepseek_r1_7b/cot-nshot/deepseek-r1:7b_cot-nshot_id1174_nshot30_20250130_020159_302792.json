    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this case using the given examples and assign weights to each risk factor. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black male with multiple arrests (4 times) and a conviction. Age is a significant factor in recidivism; being younger increases the risk. So this should be a high-weight factor contributing to YES.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which can isolate him and may contribute to feelings of depression or low support, increasing recidivism risk. High weight here too.\n\nNo high school diploma means he might have limited opportunities, leading to more substance use or other negative behaviors. High weight.\n\nHeredity plays a role in recidivism; having biological parents in the household can provide stability. Since his household size is 4 and includes both parents, this could lower risk, so maybe medium weight here.\n\nHe's not using drugs but has feelings of low mood. This could indicate mental health issues which might affect his behavior or decision-making. Medium to high weight.\n\nConsidering God's role in his life\u2014since he says nothing, it shows he's seeking external factors for meaning, which can be a sign of instability. High weight indicating higher risk.\n\nPutting all together: multiple high-weight factors like age, prior arrests, lack of education, living alone, and no religious support push towards YES. However, some mitigating factors like being in a stable household might temper the risk. Overall, considering all, I lean towards YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest due to reduced life experience and potential for impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests (4 times) and a conviction indicate past problematic behavior, raising the risk of future criminal activity or substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate puts him at a disadvantage in finding stable employment or managing substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone may contribute to feelings of isolation, potentially leading to decreased support and increased risk of negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Has held only 1 job during the year, which might indicate limited opportunities for stability or positive reinforcement in life.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drugs used but felt low mood some months ago; while this doesn't directly contribute to recidivism, persistent negative feelings can influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Composition\", \"medium\", \"Lived with a household of size 4 at a young age, which might have provided stability and support factors in the past that may not be as apparent now.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation/Support\", \"high\", \"Does not consider God as a significant influence on his personal life, indicating potential lack of spiritual guidance or coping mechanisms for stress.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
