    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I need to determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a 21-year-old female who is White. Let me go through each of her risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested once and convicted. This seems like a significant factor because prior convictions are known predictors of recidivism. So that's probably a high weight.\n\nShe holds a degree from an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can have a mitigating effect if it's higher, but since she has some education, maybe it slightly reduces the risk compared to someone without any formal education. Maybe medium weight here.\n\nLiving alone doesn't immediately indicate high risk, so I would give this factor a low weight unless there are other factors pointing towards instability.\n\nShe's completed her studies and is enrolled in college, which might show commitment, but if she's also been arrested once, the prior conviction might outweigh that.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism risk as it provides stability, so this factor would be medium.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a risk factor because it can lead to other issues or substance abuse problems, which might contribute to recidivism. This should be a high weight.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Larger households are generally associated with higher risk due to potential lack of supervision or family support, so low weight here.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her personal matters is positive as it suggests she's religious and may seek support, which could be a mitigating factor, but I'm not sure how significant this is. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), education (medium), living alone (low), job held (medium), drug use (high), household size (low), and her belief in God (medium). \n\nPrior conviction and drug use are the highest risks, so I lean towards high confidence that she might recidivate. However, since she has some educational background and is enrolled in college, which might indicate proactive steps, maybe a slight lower chance. Overall, my prediction is YES with around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has one prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the risk of recidivism as past convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having completed an associate/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college shows some educational background, but it may not fully mitigate the risk associated with prior arrests.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently indicate high risk unless other factors suggest instability or potential issues, which is not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year provides some stability and can reduce recidivism risk, but it may not fully offset other contributing factors like prior arrests and drug use.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years along with recent feelings of depression could indicate potential substance abuse issues, which are known risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 as a youth is associated with higher risk due to lack of supervision or family support, but this factor may not be as significant compared to other indicators like prior arrests and drug use.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Her belief that God has something to do with her personally suggests she may seek religious support, which could be a positive mitigating factor but is less impactful than other risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
