    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a pretty high risk factor because having prior convictions can significantly increase the chances of rearrest. I'll assign this a high weight since it's a strong indicator of recidivism.\n\nShe completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so maybe this should have a medium weight because while she has some education, being in college might show commitment, but I'm not sure how strong that impact is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's living alone, which is actually a protective factor. Living with others can provide support and reduce stress, so this shouldn't increase her risk much, maybe even lower it, so I'll give it a low weight here.\n\nShe held 1 job during the year. Job holding can be beneficial as having income can help with financial stability and reduce recidivism. So again, a low or medium weight depending on other factors.\n\nHer substance use is marijuana in the past four years. While some drug use isn't necessarily linked to violent crime, chronic substance abuse can have negative consequences, so this might contribute to higher risk, maybe a medium weight.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed last month, which is actually a good sign because mental health issues are sometimes linked to recidivism. So low weight here as well.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Larger households can offer more support and stability, so this should be a protective factor with a low weight.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes, which is generally associated with higher self-esteem and better adjustment, so another protective factor with low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), education and college enrollment (medium), living alone (low), job history (low), marijuana use (medium), no depression (low), household size (low), and spiritual involvement (low). The high risk from prior arrest might outweigh the other factors, but with some protective elements. So I'm leaning towards a low confidence of rearrest, maybe around 20%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"high\", \"A single prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as it reflects past behavior that may predict future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"While having completed associate/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college is positive, ongoing education or employment can further reduce risk, but this alone doesn't guarantee stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living independently can provide some protective factors such as reduced stress and social support, which may lower recidivism risk compared to living with others who might experience instability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held a job during the year can indicate financial stability and life skills that may help reduce recidivism risk, though it's not definitive proof of future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past substance use, especially marijuana, is associated with potential behavioral issues but doesn't directly correlate strongly with violent crime unless there are underlying issues like chronic abuse or addiction.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not experiencing depression in the past month suggests good mental health, which can reduce stress and vulnerability to negative influences that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of Entry\", \"low\", \"Living with a household size of 4 indicates shared responsibilities and support, providing some protective factors against instability or neglect which could lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Involvement\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has an influence on personal outcomes can foster positive life choices and ethical decision-making, contributing to lower recidivism risk through internalized values and support systems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
