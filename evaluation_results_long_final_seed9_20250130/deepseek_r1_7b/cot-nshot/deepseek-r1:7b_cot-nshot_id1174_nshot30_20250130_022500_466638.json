    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black male with a lot of arrest history\u20144 times convicted. That's definitely high risk because frequent arrests are often linked to more serious or longer sentences, which can impact someone's ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which might indicate instability. Living alone can sometimes lead to higher stress levels and social isolation, both of which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, so he's likely in the system for educational support but hasn't completed it. Without a diploma, job opportunities might be limited, increasing his chances of ending up back in prison.\n\nNot being enrolled in college is another factor. Maybe he's looking to get an education but hasn't started yet. Education can help with skills and reduce recidivism, so not attending could be a negative sign.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. A single job might provide stability, but it could also mean limited opportunities for advancement or support. Unemployment rates are often higher among those without a diploma, which could affect his employability.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and felt some low mood. Drug use can sometimes be a precursor to other issues, but since he's clean now, maybe it's part of his current situation. The mood issues might indicate underlying mental health problems that could contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. Sibling dynamics can vary; sometimes larger families have more support or less, but with four people, he might feel isolated despite being in a household.\n\nConsidering God's role, he doesn't believe it affects his personal issues, so that factor might not influence his recidivism as much.\n\nPutting it all together: High number of arrests (high risk), living alone (medium risk?), no diploma (high), joblessness (high), and mood issues. The high factors seem to dominate, leading me towards a YES prediction with high confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the 18-year-old Black male:\n\n- **High number of arrests**: High risk due to frequent convictions which can impact future stability.\n- **Living alone**: Medium risk indicating possible social isolation and stress.\n- **No diploma/GED**: High risk affecting job opportunities and educational support.\n- **Joblessness**: High risk potentially limiting support and skills.\n- **Mood issues**: Medium risk suggesting underlying mental health concerns.\n\nConsidering these factors, the prediction is that he will be rearrested within three years with high confidence. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Frequent Arrests\", \"high\", \"High risk due to multiple arrests which may indicate past problematic behavior and increased chances of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to social isolation and stress, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No Education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma limits educational and job opportunities, possibly hindering successful reintegration.\"),\n    (\"Joblessness\", \"high\", \"Single job may provide temporary stability but limited support and opportunities could affect long-term success.\"),\n    (\"Mood Issues\", \"medium\", \"Perceived mood issues might indicate mental health challenges that could contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
