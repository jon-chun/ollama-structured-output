    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given case based on the provided examples and assign weights to each risk factor. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black male with several risk factors:\n- 4 prior arrests and a conviction.\n- Weight of 145 lbs at 5'10\", which might indicate lower socioeconomic status.\n- Living alone without a spouse or partner.\n- No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college.\n- Employed one job during the year.\n- No drug use but felt down for part of the month.\n- Young age with a household size of 4.\n\nLooking at the examples provided:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests**: In example #6 and #28, similar cases had multiple arrests leading to rearrest. The person here has 4 prior arrests, which is high compared to others who might have fewer. This likely increases the risk, so I'll assign a high weight.\n\n2. **Education Level**: Not having a diploma or GED (examples 6,18) shows lower educational background, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. High weight here too.\n\n3. **Living Alone**: Examples like #7 and #20 show that living alone can be a risk factor for substance abuse and lack of support, leading to more rearrest. Medium weight because it's significant but not the highest factor.\n\n4. **Employment**: Employed one job (examples 18) might suggest some stability, so lower risk from this compared to others who were unemployed or underemployed. However, still a contributing factor; medium weight.\n\n5. **Drug Use**: No drug use in the past four years but feeling down (examples like #27). While not using drugs reduces risk, feeling low might indicate other issues. Medium weight because it's less impactful than prior examples with substance use.\n\n6. **Household Size and Age**: Young age and household size of 4 are present in many examples that predict rearrest (like example #18,20, etc.). This indicates potential instability or neglect, so high weight.\n\n7. **God's Influence**: No belief in God (examples like #7) might correlate with higher risk, but since this person is Black and has other factors, maybe the influence of religious belief isn't as strong here. Medium weight because it's a factor but not the most impactful compared to arrest history or education.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and young age are the most significant risk factors, followed by household size and education level. Employment doesn't seem as critical in this case. Therefore, I'll assign:\n- Prior Arrests: High\n- Education Level: High\n- Household Size: High\n- God's Influence: Medium\n\nThe other factors like living alone and employment are medium, but since the arrest history is very high (4 times), that might tip the prediction towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant number of prior arrests (4) which strongly indicates a history of criminal behavior and increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to inadequate skills and support systems.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"high\", \"Living alone at the age of 18 with a household size of 4 may indicate instability and potential neglect which can contribute to higher rearrest rates.\"),\n    (\"god_influence\", \"medium\", \"Considering that God has no influence, this may correlate with personal circumstances or beliefs that could affect behavior but is not the most direct risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Employed one job during the year; while employment can provide stability, it's less directly linked to recidivism compared to other factors like prior arrests and education level.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years but felt down for part of the month. Not using drugs reduces risk slightly but the feeling may indicate other issues which aren't as directly tied here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
