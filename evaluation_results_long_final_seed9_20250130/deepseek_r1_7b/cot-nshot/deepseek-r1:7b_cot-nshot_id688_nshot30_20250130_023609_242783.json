    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who's White. She has been arrested once and convicted. Age isn't usually a big determinant of recidivism in such cases since she's already an adult, so maybe low weight here.\n\nShe completed her associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so that might be medium to high weight.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, which help reduce recidivism risk. So maybe medium weight here.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment is positive for reducing recidivism, so perhaps low to medium weight.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to more issues, but since she's not currently depressed, maybe lower weight here.\n\nHousehold size at a young age was 4. Smaller households usually mean less supervision, so that might slightly increase risk \u2013 perhaps low weight.\n\nBelief in God: she considers God has something to do with her personal happenstance. Religious beliefs can vary; some may provide support but others might not. Maybe medium weight since it's subjective and could go either way.\n\nPutting all these together, I think the factors lean towards a lower recidivism risk. The education is strong protective, living alone isn't bad if she has other supports, and employment helps. Drug use isn't severe here. So I would predict NO with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 21 years old might not heavily influence recidivism as adults typically have better outcomes after being released from prison.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Completing an associate/junior college and currently enrolled in a 2-year college is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes reduce support networks, but since she's never been married, it might slightly increase risk rather than decrease it.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held one job during the year is a positive indicator as employment reduces stress and opportunities for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use can be a risk factor if it leads to negative outcomes, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, it might not heavily influence her risk here.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 is typical and doesn't inherently increase or decrease risk without additional context about family support.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has something to do with personal happenstance could provide some support but might also create anxiety if it leads to negative outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
