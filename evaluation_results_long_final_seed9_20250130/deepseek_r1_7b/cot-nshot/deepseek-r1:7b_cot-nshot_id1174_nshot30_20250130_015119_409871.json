    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black male will be rearrested within three years. Let me go through the risk factors one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which might indicate he's still developing and could have higher recidivism rates because of that. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Multiple convictions are usually linked to higher chances of future offenses. That's definitely a high risk.\n\nHis weight is 145 lbs, which isn't extremely low or high, but considering his height (5'10\"), he might be at a lower BMI, which could mean less risk compared to someone who's underweight or overweight. So maybe this factor has a medium impact.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living in a single environment can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, so that's another high risk point.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete basic education, which is often associated with lower self-esteem and higher propensity to engage in negative behaviors. High risk.\n\nNot enrolled in college further indicates inconsistency with societal expectations of completing higher education, adding to his recidivism risk. High risk.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency issues and lack of positive opportunities for growth. High risk.\n\nNo drug use but occasional feelings of low mood or depression. While he doesn't use drugs, emotional struggles might affect his behavior indirectly. Medium risk because it's not a direct offense but could influence future decisions.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of four. Larger households can sometimes be associated with more instability and higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors as an adult. High risk.\n\nHe believes that God has no role in his personal events. This might indicate a lack of religious support system, which could influence his behavior and willingness to seek help. Medium risk since it's about belief rather than direct factors.\n\nPutting all these together: high for age, multiple arrests, education issues, living alone, joblessness, emotional struggles, household size, and belief in no divine influence. The most significant factors are the arrests, lack of education, and living situation. All point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The person is 18 years old, which can be indicative of higher recidivism due to developmental stages.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and one conviction significantly increase the likelihood of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"medium\", \"At 5'10\" with a weight of 145 lbs, his BMI may be on the lower end but doesn't directly correlate to higher risk compared to others.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase stress and dependency issues linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED reflects inconsistent educational attainment, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Held only one job during the year, which may indicate instability affecting future opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Mood and Depression\", \"medium\", \"Occasional low mood could influence behavior but doesn't directly correlate to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of four indicates potential family dynamics that may contribute to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing God has no role might reduce social support, indirectly influencing behavior but not directly linked to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
