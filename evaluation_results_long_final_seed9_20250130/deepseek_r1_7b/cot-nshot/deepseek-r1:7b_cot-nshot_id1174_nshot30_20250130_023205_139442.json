    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young. Young adults are generally at lower risk of rearrest compared to older individuals because they're still developing and may not have established criminal tendencies yet. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times and convicted. Multiple arrests are usually a strong indicator of recidivism because it shows he has a history of law enforcement interaction, which can lead to more involvement in the future. This would probably be a high or medium risk factor.\n\nHis weight is 145 lbs, height 5'10\", but I don't think those physical factors are directly related to recidivism unless there's some context about his health or substance use, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe this factor has low relevance and doesn't add much risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can sometimes be a predictor of recidivism if it's unstable, but since he's single and living alone at 18, perhaps it's not directly contributing to high risk unless there are other issues like substance use or family dysfunction, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; people with lower education levels might be more likely to engage in criminal activities. This would contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Employment stability can impact recidivism because having a steady income and job can provide motivation to change behavior. Not working much might lead him towards other activities or substance use, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but feels down sometimes. While not using drugs lowers the immediate risk of criminal activity related to substance abuse, feeling low can sometimes be linked to broader mental health issues that could affect his decision-making and social interactions. This might add some moderate risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with a household of size 4. Young people living in larger households might face different pressures compared to single-parent homes or smaller families. I'm not sure if this directly increases recidivism risk unless there are issues like neglect or conflict, which aren't specified here.\n\nHe believes God has no influence on his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support system, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to fewer social networks for support and guidance. So that's another medium-high risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrest convictions (high), no education (high), living alone (low or medium depending on context), one job (medium), no drug use but emotional distress (moderate). The high factors like prior arrests, lack of education, and living situation might dominate. So I would lean towards a higher risk.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, similar cases with multiple arrests, lack of education, living alone, etc., often resulted in \"YES\" outcomes for rearrest. Therefore, my prediction is that this person has a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is generally associated with lower recidivism risk as they are still developing and less likely to engage in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior and rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on recidivism based on physical attributes without additional context about health or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Housing\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may not inherently increase risk unless other factors like neglect are present, which is not mentioned here.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED correlates with higher recidivism rates due to potential engagement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job may contribute to lower stability and motivation for positive change but does not directly correlate strongly with rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use history, which is a positive indicator of reduced immediate risk of related criminal activity.
