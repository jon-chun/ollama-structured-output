    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by analyzing each of her risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism. So that's probably a high weight factor.\n\nShe's completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism, so maybe this should be medium weight since she's still attending college but hasn't finished her degree yet.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Being single isn't necessarily a bad sign, but it also depends on other factors like support networks. Since she's living alone, that might slightly increase the risk, so perhaps low to medium weight.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment can contribute positively by providing income stability, so maybe this is a medium factor because only one job is mentioned.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is present, but she hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't directly a cause of rearrest unless it's leading to other issues, but since she hasn't felt depressed, perhaps it's low weight here.\n\nHer household at a young age was size 4. Larger households can sometimes provide more support, so that might be a mitigating factor, maybe medium or even high if the environment wasn't ideal.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal issues, which is actually a positive sign because spirituality and belief in a higher power are associated with lower recidivism rates. So this should probably have a high weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), education (medium), living alone (maybe medium), job held (medium), drug use recent (low), household size (medium), and spiritual support (high). \n\nNow, considering the examples provided earlier, people with prior convictions often had higher recidivism rates. The presence of a prior conviction might outweigh other mitigating factors like education or spirituality.\n\nSo, her overall risk is probably medium to high. Given that she has a prior conviction and hasn't completed her education yet, I'd lean towards predicting \"NO\" but with lower confidence because her spiritual support and education could play a role.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction is a significant indicator of recidivism. This factor has a high relative weight as it directly correlates with the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Educational Attainment\", \"medium\", \"Completing an associate or junior college and being enrolled in a 2-year college may suggest some stability, but without a degree, this factor is medium in weight.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk; however, it can be mitigated by other factors. This factor has a low relative weight here.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year provides some stability but may be outweighed by other risk factors like priorConviction and drug use.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years, especially without recent severe mental health indicators, has a low relative weight here as it hasn't led to significant issues recently.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age\", \"medium\", \"A household size of 4 may provide some support but isn't a strong mitigating factor. This factor is medium in weight.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Belief\", \"high\", \"Believing that God has something to do with personal issues strongly correlates with lower recidivism rates, making this factor high in weight.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
