    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. Let me start by looking at her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s a clear sign of prior criminal behavior, which is definitely high risk because people who have a history of getting into trouble are more likely to do it again.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Not sure if her weight affects recidivism directly, but maybe she's at a certain risk level based on other factors.\n\nShe\u2019s never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or higher stress levels, which might contribute to substance use or other issues that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe has completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Higher education usually reduces the risk of recidivism because it's associated with better job prospects and self-esteem. So this is a low risk factor for her.\n\nShe\u2019s held one job during the year, which isn't terrible but also not great. Employment can help someone find stable opportunities and reduce substance abuse issues that might lead to more trouble.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana. Substance abuse can lead to other behavioral issues or health problems that could contribute to rearrest. However, since she\u2019s enrolled in college, maybe she's working on her recovery through school or support groups.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Larger households might offer more supervision or support but could also indicate family dysfunction, which can have long-term effects.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her personal issues is interesting. If religion plays a role for her, it might help her cope with stress or substance use, so maybe this is a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history and living situation are high risk factors. Her education is good but doesn't completely offset the other issues like prior arrest, drug use, and household size. So I would lean towards predicting YES for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_convict\", \"high\", \"She has a history of arrests and convictions which indicates potential for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"She is in her late twenties, which generally correlates with lower recidivism risk compared to younger individuals who are still developing their lives.\"),\n    (\"single_resident\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes lead to higher stress levels or instability, which may contribute to substance use or other issues that could lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"education_level_college\", \"low\", \"She has completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which are positive indicators as education typically reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"She has held one job during the year; while this isn't terrible, it also doesn't indicate a stable career history that could help prevent future issues.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_4_years\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years can be a risk factor but her enrollment in college might suggest efforts to address these issues or improve her situation.\"),\n    (\"household_size_youth\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 4 at a young age could indicate family dynamics that may have long-term effects on behavior and stability.\"),\n    (\"religion_effective_coping\", \"low\", \"Her belief in God providing something to do with personal issues might offer coping mechanisms or support, which can be beneficial for managing stress or substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
