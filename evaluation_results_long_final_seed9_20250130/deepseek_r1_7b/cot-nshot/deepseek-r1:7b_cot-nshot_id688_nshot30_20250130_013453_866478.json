    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this specific case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who has been convicted once. In the previous examples, people with a single conviction often had higher recidivism rates. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year program. Education can sometimes lower recidivism, but since she's already in college, maybe it's not as impactful here. I'd say medium.\n\nLiving alone seems to be associated with lower rearrest rates compared to living with others, so that's low risk.\n\nShe holds one job during the year. Some examples had higher job stability and lower risk, so another low factor.\n\nDrug use is a significant issue; she used marijuana but not cocaine. The example with only marijuana was high risk for recidivism, so this is medium.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Larger households are generally associated with lower recidivism rates because they have more support systems. So that's low.\n\nHer belief in God might be a protective factor against recidivism, so another low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: high (conviction), medium (college), low (living alone), medium (one job), medium (marijuana use), low (household size), low (God). The highest risk comes from the prior conviction. So I'd predict a YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which is associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which may indicate ongoing education but does not directly correlate with reduced rearrest as seen in other examples where convictions were the primary factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to living with others, similar to how other examples with no family support had lower outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"medium\", \"She has held one job during the year, which in some cases can lead to higher rearrest, as seen in previous examples where stable employment was linked to lower recidivism but here it's medium due to the prior conviction and other factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"She used marijuana in the past four years.
