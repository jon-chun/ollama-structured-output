    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether a 21-year-old White female will be rearrested within three years. Let's break down her risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has one prior arrest and a conviction. That seems significant because past criminal history is a strong indicator of recidivism. So that factor would probably have a high weight.\n\nNext, her education level: she completed associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year program. College attendance usually correlates with better job prospects and higher self-esteem, which can reduce the risk. So this might be a low to medium weight.\n\nShe's living alone, which is generally a protective factor because living with family can provide support and reduce stress. I'll consider this as low weight but maybe slightly positive.\n\nShe has one job held during the year. Employment can contribute to stability, so that's another protective factor. Maybe also low weight.\n\nHer substance use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is a risk factor because it can impede her ability to function and might lead to more criminal behavior if not addressed. So this would be high weight.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed last month, which could indicate better mental health or support. That's somewhat protective but maybe medium weight since absence of depression isn't the same as being happy.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. While larger households can offer more support, it might also mean less supervision if parents aren't around. This is tricky\u2014could be low to medium depending on context. I'll lean toward medium because larger families don't always correlate with lower risk unless there's specific protective factors.\n\nHer belief in God is positive; spirituality often provides coping mechanisms and support, so that's a slight protective factor but not as strong as others. Maybe low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk from prior arrest, moderate risk from substance use, and other factors mitigating. So overall, she might have an increased chance of recidivism compared to similar cases.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, her prior arrest is a major red flag with high weight. Substance abuse, despite being part of her history, has some mitigating factors like living alone and college education. However, the presence of prior arrest and ongoing substance use likely increases her risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"She has one prior arrest and a conviction, indicating past criminal behavior which is strongly associated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which generally correlates with better job prospects and reduced risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can provide some level of stability but may lack the protective influence of family support compared to other factors like higher education or employment.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She has held one job during the year, which can contribute to financial stability and reduced stress, acting as a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Her use of marijuana in the past four years may indicate potential substance abuse issues that could lead to further criminal behavior if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, but absence of depression does not necessarily translate to overall mental well-being without further evaluation.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size four could offer some level of support but may also lack the supervision or protective influence that smaller households provide.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality (God's Influence)\", \"low\", \"Her belief in God is considered positive and can provide coping mechanisms, though it does not directly mitigate criminal behavior risk as strongly as other factors like employment or education.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
