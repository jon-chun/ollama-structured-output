    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 18-year-old Black male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his high number of arrests (4 times) and convictions suggests a history of criminal behavior, which is definitely a strong risk factor. That's probably a high weight because more past legal issues usually mean higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs, but I don't think physical attributes like height or weight are considered in recidivism unless there's something about his health status, which isn't indicated here. So maybe a low weight for this factor.\n\nNever being married\u2014marital status can sometimes influence support systems, but if he's living alone and has no kids, it might not directly correlate with higher rearrest rates. Maybe medium or low? Not sure yet.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED certificate\u2014it\u2019s important because education often correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism. This is a significant risk factor, so probably high weight.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college\u2014this suggests instability in his educational pursuits, which can affect his employability and living situation stability. High weight here as well.\n\nHeld 1 job during the year\u2014he\u2019s employed at least once, but only one job might indicate limited income or skills, potentially increasing the risk if he loses that job or needs more stable income. High weight.\n\nNo drug use in past four years\u2014good sign, so lower risk from substance abuse. Probably low weight for this factor.\n\nFelt down during the month\u2014he experienced emotional distress, which could affect his mental health and ability to function normally. Medium weight as it's concerning but not directly tied to recidivism unless there are underlying issues like depression or anxiety.\n\nLived in a household of size 4\u2014size can impact living conditions; larger households might have more resources or support, so maybe lower risk, but four is moderate. Not sure if high or medium here.\n\nBelieves God has no role\u2014he may not have the same level of social support or religious backing which could be a factor in his behavior and stability. Medium weight as it's an indirect factor affecting his personal situation.\n\nPutting it all together: High on education (no diploma) and past convictions, medium on employment history but positive in job held. The arrest count is high, so that's the main driver here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 4 arrests and 1 conviction, indicating a significant criminal background which strongly correlates with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Not being married and living alone does not directly indicate high risk without additional factors like unstable support networks or lack of children.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED certificate can impact job opportunities and future stability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding only 1 job during the past year may suggest limited income potential or skills which could be problematic in the long term if circumstances change.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Emotional Distress\", \"low\", \"No drug use history is positive, but some feelings of low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues that might not directly correlate with recidivism but warrant concern.\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living with 4 people in a household may suggest moderate living conditions, which could be an indicator of stability or lack thereof, affecting overall risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God and Personal Support Systems\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence might mean fewer social supports, potentially impacting his ability to manage personal challenges effectively.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
