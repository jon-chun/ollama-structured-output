    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 4 times and convicted. That seems like a high number of convictions, which could indicate past trouble, so that's probably a high risk factor. From the examples given, people with multiple arrests often have higher rearrest rates.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which might mean he doesn't have support from family or friends to help him if something goes wrong. That could be another high risk factor because isolation can lead to more stress and problems.\n\nHis educational background is a problem\u2014he has no high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates, so that's definitely a high factor.\n\nHe's never been married, which might mean he doesn't have the support network from his spouse to help him through tough times. That could also contribute to higher chances of rearrest, so another high risk.\n\nHe has held only 1 job during the year. Joblessness can lead to economic instability and increased stress, making it more likely for him to reoffend within three years. So that's a high factor too.\n\nNow, he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is positive. Not using drugs could mean better sobriety and less risk from substance abuse, which might lower his recidivism chance compared to someone who has been using drugs.\n\nHowever, some of the time during the past month he felt down and couldn't cheer himself up. That's a bit concerning because chronic feelings of low mood can lead to substance use or other risky behaviors. This could be a medium factor since it's not constant but still present.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age, which might suggest he didn't have a stable environment growing up. Larger households sometimes correlate with more family issues, which could impact his ability to stay out of trouble later on\u2014so that's another high risk factor.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal happenings is interesting. If he doesn't see a higher power as a factor in his life, he might be more likely to make decisions based on personal or external stressors rather than a guiding force, which could influence his behavior and increase recidivism chances\u2014so high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (high), living alone (high), low education (high), single status (high), one job (high). Only the drug use is positive, but the mood issues might add to the risk. The belief in God is also a contributing factor here.\n\nGiven these factors, his recidivism risk seems pretty high. Looking at similar cases like Example 26 and 30, where multiple arrests, isolation, low education, etc., led to a \"YES\" outcome for rearrest within three years, this person's situation aligns with those examples.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (4 times)\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests indicate past criminal behavior and increased likelihood of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which may increase stress and the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"No Education or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and resources.\"),\n    (\"Never Married\", \"high\", \"Single status may lack support from a spouse, potentially affecting mental health and stability.\"),\n    (\"One Job\", \"high\", \"Joblessness can lead to economic instability and increased stress, contributing to reoffending risks.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use in Past 4 Years\", \"low\", \"No drug use is positive as it reduces potential for substance abuse-related issues.\"),\n    (\"Chronic Low Mood\", \"medium\", \"Some time feeling down could indicate stress or other issues that might influence behavior but not consistently high risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size 4 at Age\", \"high\", \"Larger households can sometimes correlate with more family issues affecting later stability.\"),\n    (\"Belief in Nothing (God)\", \"high\", \"No belief in a higher power may lead to decisions based on personal or external stressors, increasing risk.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
