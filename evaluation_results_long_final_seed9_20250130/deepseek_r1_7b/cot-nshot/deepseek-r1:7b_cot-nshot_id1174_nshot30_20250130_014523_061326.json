    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his arrest history: he's been arrested 4 times and convicted. That seems significant. More arrests usually correlate with higher recidivism rates because it shows a tendency to get involved in the criminal system before turning 18, which can be problematic early on.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 145 lbs. While his height is above average for that age group, his weight might indicate he's at a higher risk if he's struggling with substance abuse or being underweight. But since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, maybe that factor isn't as high.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and no kids. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to feelings of depression or low self-esteem. That could increase his risk if it leads him towards more negative behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lacking education can limit opportunities and potentially lead to worse outcomes. Also, not being enrolled suggests he might have considered returning to school but didn't. Maybe this is a contributing factor.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness can be tough, especially if it leads to financial instability or increased stress, which could contribute to mental health issues.\n\nHe feels down sometimes, though he hasn't used drugs. Emotional struggles without substance use might indicate internalized issues or personal problems affecting his stability.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of 4. Larger households can sometimes offer more support but might also have issues like neglect if not properly supervised, which could be a risk factor.\n\nConsidering that he believes God has no influence on his life, this might lead to a lack of direction or hope, pushing him towards negative choices.\n\nNow, looking at the examples given: in Example 1, someone with similar factors (4 arrests, living alone, no diploma) had a YES outcome. Another example where someone felt down but without substance use also had a YES. The key seems to be that multiple risk factors, especially arrest history and education issues, heavily influence the prediction.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk for recidivism because of past criminal behavior, lack of education, isolation, unemployment, emotional instability, and limited family support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (4 times)\", \"high\", \"Past criminal behavior increases the likelihood of future arrests.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and contribute to negative outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living in isolation may lead to emotional instability but without specific behavioral issues, it's moderate.\"),\n    (\"Unemployed (1 job)\", \"low\", \"Employment typically provides stability; however, unemployment could indicate potential for further issues.\"),\n    (\"Emotional struggles\", \"low\", \"No drug use and minimal mood swings suggest this factor is not a significant risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
