    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's definitely a red flag. From the examples given, people with a criminal history tend to have higher recidivism rates, so that's probably a high weight factor.\n\nShe's completed associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism if it's ongoing, but if she hasn't graduated yet, that might not be as strong of an indicator. It depends on her motivation to succeed, which isn't clear here. So maybe medium weight.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Living in a stable environment generally reduces risk, so this might actually lower the recidivism rate. But it's a bit of an outlier compared to other factors, so perhaps low weight.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism if it leads to more risky behavior, but since she's not feeling down lately, maybe that factor isn't as strong. Maybe medium weight.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with a household of size 4 in an urban area. Larger households might offer more support and stability, which could lower the risk. So this might be a low to medium weight.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one arrest (high), education (medium), living alone (low), drug use recent (medium), and a stable past household (low). The high weight from her prior arrest would likely pull the prediction towards YES, but other factors like ongoing education and recent drug use might temper that slightly. Since she's in college now, maybe her academic focus could lead to better outcomes, which might balance out the other factors.\n\nBut given the examples provided earlier where someone with a similar profile had an outcome of NO, it's possible this case is more nuanced. Her education level is good, but if she's not completing it and has recent drug use without negative outcomes recently, maybe her risk isn't as high as others in the past examples.\n\nI'm leaning towards NO because while there are mitigating factors like education and living alone, the prior arrest might be a stronger indicator than it would seem. Plus, her recent drug use doesn't necessarily correlate with rearrest if she's managed it well.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism as indicated by the examples provided where similar cases resulted in YES outcomes despite mitigating factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has completed associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college.
