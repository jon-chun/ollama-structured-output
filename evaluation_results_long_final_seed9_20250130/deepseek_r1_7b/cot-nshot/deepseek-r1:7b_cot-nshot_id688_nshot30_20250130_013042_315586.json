    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. The person is a 21-year-old female who's White, arrested once and convicted, weighs 163 lbs, 6 feet tall. She's living alone, has a high school diploma with an associate or junior college degree, enrolled in a 2-year college, held one job, used marijuana, hasn't felt depressed recently, lived in a household of four at age young, and believes God affects her life.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I need to assign weights to each risk factor. First, the arrest: one time conviction might indicate past behavior but not necessarily high recidivism. Her education is good, so that's positive. Living alone isn't a risk factor here. enrolled in college might be low risk if it's a positive engagement.\n\nShe used marijuana once; examples showed sometimes use doesn't always lead to rearrest. Not feeling depressed recently suggests she's mentally stable. Household size at 4: not sure how that affects, maybe more support but can also have issues. Believes in God: could be protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, factors like past arrest, drug use, and living situation are present. But her education and positive engagement might lower the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrest\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, which indicates prior substance use issues but not necessarily high recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"She has completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating higher education which is typically protective against rearrest\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not indicate high risk of substance use or criminal behavior but can sometimes be associated with other issues like mental health challenges\"),\n    (\"enrolled_in_college\", \"high\", \"Enrolling in a 2-year college indicates proactive education and support which is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"job held\", \"low\", \"She has held one job during the year, which suggests stability and previous employment experience that can aid in reintegration post release\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"low\", \"Used marijuana once in the past four years; past use does not necessarily correlate with high rearrest risk as seen in other examples where similar use did not lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive indicator of current mental health status and potential protective factors\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Lived with household size 4 at young age; household size alone does not necessarily indicate high risk but can vary based on composition and dynamics\"),\n    (\"god_effect\", \"high\", \"Believes God has something to do with her life, which can be protective as spirituality or religious beliefs often support personal growth and accountability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
