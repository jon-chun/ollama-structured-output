    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each of his risk factors one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his arrest history: he's been arrested 4 times and convicted. In the examples, people with multiple arrests tend to have higher recidivism rates. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nNext, his weight: he's 145 lbs at 5'10\". I don't see any specific references in the examples about weight affecting recidivism, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nEducation level: He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. From the examples, lack of education is definitely a significant factor, so this should be high.\n\nLiving situation: He's living alone, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk if he's unstable, but it also depends on other factors. In some cases, being alone might indicate lower support, so maybe medium to high.\n\nEmployment: He held only 1 job during the year. Employment is generally linked to lower recidivism because having a stable job can provide substance and reduce stress. So this might be low or medium risk depending on other factors.\n\nDrugs: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is positive. Not using drugs reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior related to drugs. So this would lower his risk, maybe low.\n\nMood: Some of the time during the past month he felt down. While having a bad mood can be stressful, it's not directly tied to recidivism unless there's other instability. In examples, people with temporary low moods sometimes had higher rates if other factors were present. Here, since he's otherwise stable in other areas (like job and living alone), maybe medium.\n\nHousehold size at young age: He lived with a household of 4 when he was young. In the examples, larger households can be associated with lower recidivism because there might be more support or less stress. So this could be low risk.\n\nGod's involvement: He says God has nothing to do with his personal issues. This is interesting. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can sometimes reduce recidivism by providing moral support, but if someone doesn't believe in a higher power, it might not help. However, since he's Black and perhaps from a religious background, this could be mixed. In the examples, his faith was mentioned as a factor, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together: He has multiple arrests (high), no education (high), living alone (medium), one job (maybe low-medium), no drug use (low), mood issues but perhaps manageable (medium), and no God involvement which might be mixed. So weighing these factors:\n\nHigh risk for multiple arrests, no education, living alone, mood issues. Medium for job, drug use, and God's role.\n\nSo the overall prediction would lean towards high risk since he has several significant negatives. The examples showed that people with 4+ arrests often had higher YES outcomes, so maybe in this case, it's a high confidence of YES.\n</think>\n\nBased on his history of multiple arrests (high), lack of education and employment stability (medium-low), living alone (medium), mood issues (medium), and no involvement with religion affecting recidivism (mixed), the overall prediction is that he has a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested 4 times, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED, indicating potential for unstable behavior and lower chances of job stability.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate lack of support network but may not be directly linked to higher risk unless other factors are present.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held only 1 job during the year, which is often associated with reduced stress and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drugs\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, reducing the likelihood of substance-related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mood\", \"medium\", \"Some mood issues but manageable, which may not directly correlate to higher risk if other factors are present.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Lived with a household of 4 at young age, which can indicate support and lower stress levels.\"),\n    (\"god_involved\", \"mixed\", \"No involvement with God, which in some cases might be positive but the individual's Black background may suggest different factors at play.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
