    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of multiple arrests\u2014four times\u2014and being convicted. That's pretty significant. From the examples given, people with multiple arrests often have higher recidivism rates because each arrest can lead to more supervision and opportunities for reoffending. So that might be a high-risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which is another red flag. Without education, he might struggle to find stable employment and could turn to other criminal activities. That's definitely a high risk.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes lead to isolation, but it also allows him more control over his environment. However, if he hasn't had any positive experiences living on his own yet, this factor isn't as strong. Maybe medium?\n\nHe didn't hold any jobs during the past year. Joblessness can contribute to lack of stability and increases the chance of engaging in criminal activities again. So that's another high-risk factor.\n\nNot using drugs is a good sign because drug use often correlates with higher recidivism rates, but since he hasn't used for four years, it might actually reduce his risk here. Maybe medium or low?\n\nFeeling down a lot and not being able to cheer himself up could indicate some underlying issues like mental health problems. But without specific info on mental health services, this is more of a medium concern.\n\nLiving in a household of size 4 at a young age suggests he might have experienced a more stable environment initially, but now living alone might change things. Maybe low to medium risk depending on his current circumstances.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal issues could indicate some level of alienation or lack of faith, which might be linked to other behavioral issues. That's another medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together: High for arrests and education, high for living alone if he hasn't turned positive yet, medium for joblessness, low for drug use (since he doesn't use), medium for emotional state, and medium for family background. \n\nThe arrest history is the biggest red flag here, so even with some mitigating factors like not using drugs or being relatively young, the multiple arrests push him towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (4 times and convicted)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests increase the likelihood of reoffending due to supervision and opportunities for criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (No diploma or GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can lead to unstable employment and higher rates of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may provide some control over environment, but without positive experiences, it's a moderate risk factor for recidivism in this case.\"),\n    (\"Joblessness (No jobs during the past year)\", \"high\", \"Joblessness can lead to lack of stability and increased engagement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Never used in past 4 years)\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs may indicate a lower risk related to substance abuse, which is not directly linked to recidivism here.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State (Felt down often)\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down can relate to mental health issues that might contribute indirectly to recidivism but without specific info, it's moderate.\"),\n    (\"Family History (Household size 4 at young age)\", \"low\", \"Young age and household size may indicate a more stable early environment compared to current living situation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
