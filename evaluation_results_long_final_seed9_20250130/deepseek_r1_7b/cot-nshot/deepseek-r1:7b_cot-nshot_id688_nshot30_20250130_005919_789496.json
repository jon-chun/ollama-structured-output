    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young but also within a typical range for potentialfirst-time offenses. She's White, which isn't inherently a high risk, but being convicted once might indicate some prior issues.\n\nShe has a height of 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. I don't know if that's relevant here; maybe it affects her situation in terms of labor or something else, but probably not directly related to rearrest recidivism.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because she might not have support for dealing with issues like drug use. But she's also attending both an associate/junior college and a 2-year college, which suggests she's actively engaged in education. That's a positive sign that she might be committed to improving herself.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some employment can help reduce recidivism because it provides income stability and motivation to change her life. However, if the job is related to substance use, maybe there are underlying issues still present.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Marijuana alone doesn't necessarily lead to severe depression, so this might not be a strong risk factor. But it's something to consider for any potential relapse or ongoing issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Larger households sometimes have more resources, which could help with substance abuse issues if she was experiencing them. But since she's now living alone and not married, maybe that support system is gone.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal issues. This can be both a strength because it might motivate her to change, or a weakness because it could mean she doesn't seek help when needed. It's a bit tricky; sometimes religious beliefs can lead to denial of problems if she doesn't find solutions within that framework.\n\nPutting this all together: She has one prior conviction, which is a risk factor, but her education and attending college are strong positive factors. The fact that she's 21 might be both a pro and con depending on the context. Her living situation and current support from God could influence her ability to manage substance use.\n\nConsidering the examples given, when someone has these factors (like education, not being in a large household, attending college), their outcomes were mostly \"NO\" for rearrest. However, prior convictions and some other factors like drug use can tip it towards \"YES\".\n\nIn this case, she's got her education which is a good sign, but one prior conviction could weigh against her. Her current job might help sustain her, but if the job isn't related to substance use, maybe not a major issue.\n\nHer belief in God might actually be a positive because it can drive change, but if she's not seeking external help, that's a risk. The household size when young was 4, which is similar to some examples where outcomes were \"NO\", so that's another point towards safety.\n\nOverall, I think the prior conviction and drug use are significant factors, while education, attending college, and living alone might mitigate it. So weighing these, maybe she has a lower risk but not entirely safe.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"medium\", \"She has one prior conviction which indicates past behavior that could impact her ability to reintegrate successfully. This is a moderate risk factor as it suggests potential for future issues if not addressed with support and education.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She held one job during the year, which can provide stability and motivation towards positive change. This is a low-risk factor as employment often correlates with reduced recidivism rates when employed in unrelated fields.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Completing associate/junior college and enrolled in a 2-year college shows her commitment to further education.
