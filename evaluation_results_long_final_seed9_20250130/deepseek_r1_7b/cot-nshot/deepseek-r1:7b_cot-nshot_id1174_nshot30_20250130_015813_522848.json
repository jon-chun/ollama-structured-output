    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this case to analyze. Let me start by going through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, the person is an 18-year-old Black male with a bunch of arrest and living situation details. He's been arrested four times and convicted, which immediately makes me think he has a history of criminal behavior that could impact his recidivism. That should be a high-weight factor because being repeatedly arrested can lead to more negative outcomes.\n\nHe's currently living alone without any family support, so that's another red flag. Living in a singleton household can limit access to resources and emotional support, which is probably a medium to high weight risk factor. Maybe high since it's directly related to social isolation affecting his well-being.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't complete basic education. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can limit opportunities and self-help resources. That should be a high-weight factor as well.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college despite never being married, which might suggest he doesn't see the value in further education or training. This could be another high-weight factor since educational discontinuation is linked to unstable lives.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year, indicating limited income and stability. Unemployment can lead to financial stress and lack of support networks, so this should be a medium-high weight factor.\n\nHe feels down occasionally but hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Since he's not using drugs, maybe that aspect is less relevant now, so perhaps a low weight here because while mood swings are noted, there's no drug use to correlate with.\n\nConsidering his household size at 4 when he was young might indicate some level of family support or instability. That could be medium weight since it\u2019s somewhat significant but not as directly impactful as living alone.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with his personal issues suggests a lack of religious support, which can affect mental health and decision-making. This should be a medium weight factor because it's important for self-perceived support systems.\n\nPutting all these together: high-weight factors include past arrests, no education, living alone, not in college, and no drug use (since he hasn't used drugs). Medium weights are job history and household size at young age. Low weight is mood swings without drug use.\n\nGiven the high number of negative risk factors, especially arrest history and lack of education, I'm leaning towards a 'YES' prediction for rearrest recidivism. The presence of prior convictions increases the likelihood he might reoffend.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Relevant Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant arrest history (4 times) and has been convicted, which is a strong indicator of past criminal behavior that could influence future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone without family support can lead to isolation and potential stressors that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No Education/GED\", \"high\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED is often linked to higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities for self-improvement and resource access.\"),\n    (\"Not Enrolled in College\", \"high\", \"Not being enrolled in college despite never marrying suggests a lack of educational pursuit, which can correlate with unstable life circumstances that may lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment Record\", \"medium\", \"Held only one job during the year, which could indicate limited income stability and potential stress from financial challenges or unemployment \"),\n    (\"Mood Swings\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years but occasional mood swings; since he hasn't used drugs, this factor is less relevant to current recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 18\", \"medium\", \"Lived with a household of size 4 at young age, which may suggest some level of family support or potential instability that could impact later life circumstances.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
