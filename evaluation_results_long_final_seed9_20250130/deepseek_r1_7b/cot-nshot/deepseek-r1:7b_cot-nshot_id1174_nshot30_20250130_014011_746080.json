    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine the relative weight of each risk factor for this 18-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is significant because he's still developing. Young adults often have higher recidivism rates due to inexperience and impulsive decisions. So that's a high weight.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of past problematic behavior, so this should be a high weight factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 145 lbs. While physical factors can sometimes be linked to substance use or other issues, there's not enough info here to tie it directly to recidivism. So maybe medium weight.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone suggests possible isolation, which could contribute but isn't a direct risk factor. Medium weight seems appropriate.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a clear indicator of lower education, which often correlates with higher recidivism. High weight.\n\nNot enrolled in college reinforces the lack of educational opportunities. High weight.\n\nHe held one job during the year; maybe not stable enough to prevent issues but not directly contributing either. Medium weight.\n\nNo drug use for four years and some low mood suggests he's in a better mental state, which is protective against recidivism. So this factor should have a lower weight.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could be isolating or indicate potential family dysfunction; medium weight as it's related but not definitive.\n\nHe lived with a household of size four when young. Sibling living arrangements can affect family support and mental health, so maybe medium to high. Since it's just the number of people without info on dynamics, I'll go with medium.\n\nConsidering God has no influence\u2014he might have a strong moral foundation or different life circumstances. Medium weight as it doesn't directly contribute but could indicate personal strengths.\n\nPutting this all together: High factors are age and multiple arrests, followed by lack of education and employment. Medium factors include living alone and family size at 18. Low factors are his mood and faith.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which is a significant factor in recidivism due to developmental stage and potential for impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests (4) and one conviction indicate past problematic behavior, increasing the likelihood of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong indicator of educational barriers that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Living alone but employed for 1 year suggests some level of responsibility and support, though not consistently contributing to stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates recent sobriety, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mood/Psychological Factors\", \"low\", \"Experiencing low mood for part of the month may indicate personal stress but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment at 18\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size four could suggest potential family dysfunction or limited support, which is related but not definitive.\"),\n    (\"Religious Influence\", \"medium\", \"Considering God has no influence indicates a strong moral foundation but doesn't directly contribute to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
