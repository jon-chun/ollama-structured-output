    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm going to analyze each risk factor provided for the 21-year-old White female and assign a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them based on their potential impact on her likelihood of rearrest.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is definitely a significant risk factor because it indicates a history of legal issues which can affect future employment and living situations, increasing the chance of engaging in problematic behavior again.\n\nShe's completed an associate or junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level is inversely related to recidivism; higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and stable living arrangements, so this might actually be a mitigating factor, but since she's already attending college, it's somewhat positive. However, being enrolled still shows commitment, which isn't bad.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation or stress, but without more context on her support network, this might not be a strong risk factor. It could potentially indicate she relies on others for support, which is positive, so maybe low weight here.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having a job is beneficial as it provides income stability and can offer substance to rebuild her life. So, one job isn't a major issue but doesn't contribute much either.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: she used marijuana. While drug use can lead to impulsive behavior or further legal issues, the fact that it's only marijuana might not have severe consequences compared to other drugs like cocaine or meth. However, even occasional use can be concerning and might predict some risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of recent emotional distress could indicate resilience, which is a positive sign, reducing the likelihood of high recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. The size of the household can affect stability; larger families might offer more support but could also mean higher dependency on others. Without knowing if she has other support sources now, this might be neutral or low weight.\n\nShe believes God is involved in her life\u2014this is actually a positive factor as religious involvement often correlates with better personal behavior and support systems, reducing recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The most significant risk factors here are the prior arrest (high) and any potential for isolation due to living alone. However, the presence of education, job, and religious involvement mitigates some risk. Given that she has a prior conviction but is enrolled in college and working, her chances might be on the lower side, leaning towards NO with low confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest record which can impact their likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She is currently enrolled in college and may have higher education which could positively influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not necessarily indicate high isolation but may suggest reliance on others, which is a positive factor.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having one job during the year indicates some stability, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Only marijuana use in the past four years might be concerning but not severe compared to other substances like cocaine or meth.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Health\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed for a month may indicate resilience, reducing potential rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age\", \"low\", \"Living with a household of size 4 could imply some dependency on others, which is slightly concerning but not definitive.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"high\", \"Considering God's involvement in her life can correlate with better personal behavior and support systems, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
