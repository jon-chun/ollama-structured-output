    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female from White background. Generally, race and gender can influence recidivism rates, but these are not definitive indicators on their own. She has one arrest and a conviction, which suggests some previous involvement with the system, though it's just once.\n\nHer height and weight don't provide much direct information about risk. She's never married and living alone, which might be related to her stability or lifestyle choices, but again, not directly predictive of recidivism.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in a 2-year program. Education level can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates if it leads to better job opportunities, but it's not the most direct indicator.\n\nShe held one job during the year; employment history is generally a positive sign as having a job can provide stability and reduce stressors leading to recidivism.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years.Marijuana use isn't as strongly associated with severe recidivism compared to other drugs like alcohol or cocaine, but even occasional use might have some association. She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a good sign as depression can sometimes lead to substance abuse.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. A larger household at a younger age might indicate higher stress levels or instability earlier on, which could be related to her current risk factors.\n\nShe believes in God's influence over her life. Religious beliefs can have varying effects; some religions emphasize forgiveness and avoiding sin, which might correlate with lower recidivism rates, but others may not.\n\nPutting it all together: One arrest and conviction, occasional marijuana use, living alone, stable employment, and religious belief are the main factors here. The one-time conviction is a red flag, but her other factors seem to mitigate some risk indicators. However, given that she has a prior conviction, even with some mitigating factors like education and employment, this might still indicate a moderate to high risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
