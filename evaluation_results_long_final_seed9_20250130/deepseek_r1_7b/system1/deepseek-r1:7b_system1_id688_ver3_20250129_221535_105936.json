    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk based on the provided data. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. At this relatively young age in the US, which typically has higher recidivism rates compared to older adults, I might consider lower risk. However, race can still play a role depending on systemic factors and local data, so that's something to note but not conclusive.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction is significant because it indicates past involvement in the legal system, which could be a warning sign of potential future behavior. Recidivism rates for individuals with even one prior conviction are often higher than those without any history.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, and she weighs 163 lbs. While BMI can give an indication of health risks related to weight, since she's just 21 years old, I don't have enough information about her current weight management or lifestyle factors that could influence risk assessment.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors like financial instability or lack of support networks. Since this isn't specified as problematic, it's a neutral point for now.\n\nHer educational background includes an associate/junior college degree and currently attending a 2-year college. College attendance can be a positive indicator in terms of self-direction and higher education aspirations, but it doesn't directly correlate with risk without more context on how she's using this education.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year. Employment history is important; having no income or part-time work might suggest instability, which could relate to high-risk behavior if she can't support herself financially. However, holding a job at least once indicates some level of responsibility.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. While drug use isn't always a direct indicator of violent crime, chronic substance abuse can be linked to various behavioral issues. Not feeling depressed might suggest she's managing her substances well or avoiding triggers, which could mitigate risk but doesn't eliminate it entirely.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at an early age. Sibling relationships and family dynamics can influence personal behavior. However, without knowing the composition of the household or any potential stressors from that time, this factor alone isn't enough to classify her as high risk.\n\nLastly, she believes in God's role in her life. Religious affiliation can correlate with lower recidivism rates due to moral values and community support, but again, it depends on other factors like family environment or personal circumstances not provided here.\n\nPutting all these together: A single prior conviction is a strong indicator of potential future involvement in the legal system. The rest of the factors don't provide clear evidence of high risk unless there are underlying issues not mentioned. Therefore, I would lean towards moderate risk but not necessarily high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
