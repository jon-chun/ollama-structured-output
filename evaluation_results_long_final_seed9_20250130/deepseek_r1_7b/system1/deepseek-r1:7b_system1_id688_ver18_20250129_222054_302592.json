    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age 21 might be considered relatively young, but it's also possible she has had significant life experiences that could affect her behavior or likelihood to reoffend.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. This is one prior offense, which is a red flag. Convictions, especially at such a young age, can indicate past criminal behavior. However, the fact that she's completed associate/junior college might suggest some level of education, which could be a mitigating factor if she has higher education.\n\nShe stands 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. While height or weight alone don't directly correlate with risk, they can sometimes indicate other factors like health issues or substance use. She's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently make her more risky, but it could mean she has less support around her potential criminal behavior.\n\nShe's completed associate/junior college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Higher education can be a mitigating factor as it often correlates with better job opportunities and life skills that reduce recidivism risk. However, her current enrollment might suggest she's actively working on improving herself.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having at least one job can indicate responsibility and stability, which are positive factors in reducing reoffending. \n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use isn't severe, especially compared to other substances like cocaine or alcohol. Her recent lack of depression might suggest she's managing her mental health well.\n\nShe lived alone at a young age with a household size of 4. This indicates she was an only child or had little family support around her formative years. This could be associated with higher risk if she experienced neglect or abuse, but without more information on that, it's hard to assess.\n\nHer belief in God: Religious affiliation can influence behavior; some individuals might make different choices based on their faith, but again, this is speculative and doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's a history of such beliefs influencing her actions.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the presence of one prior conviction at an early age could be a significant indicator. Her education level mitigates some risk, but her living situation alone might not necessarily increase it without more context on family dynamics or personal issues. \n\nI think the prior conviction is the most impactful here. It's less about other factors and more about that single offense. So I'd lean towards a high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
