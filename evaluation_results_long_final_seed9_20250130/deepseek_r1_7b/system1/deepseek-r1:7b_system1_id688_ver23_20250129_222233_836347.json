    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with analyzing these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White. Sensitive because race can influence risk assessments due to historical and systemic factors. But alone here; no indication of racial discrimination issues yet.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. One arrest is significant but not life-threatening. Convictions do carry risks though, especially if it's for a serious offense or if there's recidivism history.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, which isn't particularly tall, and her weight is 163 lbs. No info on BMI, but she's described as fit, so maybe she's in decent shape. Not directly indicating risk unless related to substance use or health issues.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to stress or depression. She hasn't felt depressed recently, though.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year program. Education level typically doesn't directly correlate with risk unless it's lack of education leading to risky behavior, but she seems committed to furthering her education.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Single job can be stable or not, depending on circumstances. No info on income or stability here.\n\nDrug use: Only marijuana in past four years and no recent depression. Marijuana is a mild substance; less likely to cause significant issues unless combined with alcohol or other drugs. No sign of drug abuse affecting her mental health recently.\n\nHousehold size at young age was 4, which isn't too large. Maybe she had some family support initially but now lives alone.\n\nBelieves in God's role in her life. This could relate to personal spirituality and stress management, possibly reducing risk factors related to substance use or emotional issues.\n\nPutting it all together: The one arrest is a red flag, but not the most concerning unless it's for a serious offense or if she has a history of recidivism. Her living situation alone might increase some risks without specific evidence. She hasn't shown signs of drug abuse beyond marijuana and no recent depression. Education-wise, she's committed which might mitigate risk from lack of education.\n\nSo overall, the factors don't point strongly towards high risk but have enough that maybe a cautious approach is needed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
