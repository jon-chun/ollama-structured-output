    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down these risk factors step by step. First, the person is a 21-year-old White female who's been arrested once and convicted. That's one conviction already, which is significant. Age-wise, she's quite young, but that might indicate less life experience.\n\nShe's completed her associate degree or junior college and is now in a two-year program. Education seems solid; I wonder if higher education correlates with lower recidivism rates. She's living alone, so no family support, which can be risky as family can provide stability.\n\nHer job situation: she's held one job in the past year. That might suggest some level of responsibility and reliability. She uses marijuana, which isn't severe but could indicate drug use without supervision. Not feeling depressed over the past month is interesting; sometimes substance use can lead to mood issues or vice versa.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age, so she's been part of a family environment from an early age. Believing in God might provide some spiritual support but doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior. \n\nPutting it all together: one conviction is concerning. Age and living alone are factors that could increase risk. The lack of family support and possibly unstable living conditions might contribute to higher reoffending chances. The drug use, though minor, can be a red flag. Her education seems okay but isn't directly tied to criminal history.\n\nConsidering all these points, I'm leaning towards high risk with 65% confidence because the conviction and living situation are significant factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
