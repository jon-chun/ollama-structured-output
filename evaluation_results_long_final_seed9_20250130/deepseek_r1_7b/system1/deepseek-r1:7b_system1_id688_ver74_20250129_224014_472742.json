    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is typically not a strong indicator of future criminal behavior unless it's significantly higher, so that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant point because prior convictions are usually indicators of recidivism. One conviction can increase the risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, weight 163 lbs. These physical attributes don't directly indicate risk unless there's something about them that suggests criminal behavior, which isn't evident here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation alone doesn't inherently correlate with risk unless there are other factors like substance abuse or unstable relationships, but nothing points to that here.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education generally correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this might reduce the risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job stability can affect recidivism; having a job usually means financial stability which can deter substance abuse or unstable environments. So that's a positive sign.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially without severe mental health issues, might not be a strong indicator of high risk unless it leads to other issues like homelessness or violence.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Larger households are often associated with higher risk because there's more potential for conflict and drug abuse within the family.\n\nLastly, she believes in God. Religious affiliation can correlate with lower recidivism rates as people may turn to spirituality for guidance rather than self-destructive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: One prior conviction is a red flag, living alone or with a larger household could be risk factors if other issues are present, but without more info on substance abuse, mental health, or unstable living conditions, the overall risk isn't extremely high. Her age and education work against her, while religion might mitigate some risk.\n\nSo, I'd rate this as moderate risk with about 45% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\nThe presence of a prior conviction increases the risk. However, other factors like age and education slightly mitigate the risk, leading to a moderate prediction.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
