    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is typically not a strong indicator of risk on its own, but being an adult increases her capacity to make independent decisions.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. Conviction history does suggest some level of criminal behavior in the past, which could indicate a risk of reoffending if not properly supervised.\n\nHer physical characteristics are 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs. There's no immediate risk associated with her height or weight unless there's evidence she has health issues, but that isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently pose a high risk without additional factors like financial dependency or lack of support networks, which aren't provided.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in a 2-year program. Education level typically correlates with lower risk if properly utilized, but if she's not employed effectively, that could be a concern.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Single job suggests some stability, but it also means limited support network which can contribute to dependency issues.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning because even if there's no depression now, it could lead to relapse or increased risk of substance-related crimes.\n\nShe's never felt depressed over the past month despite drug use. This might indicate she's using drugs as a coping mechanism for underlying mental health issues which can affect her behavior and decision-making.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. Being part of a larger family at a younger age could imply more support but also potentially more dependency on others if things fall apart.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her personal events is positive as it suggests seeking spiritual guidance which can aid in managing stress and making ethical decisions.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some risk indicators like prior conviction and drug use, the factors don't strongly indicate high risk. The presence of a job, education, and her religious belief balance these concerns. However, considering the history of substance use without addressing its underlying causes might be a moderate red flag. \n\nSo, I would lean towards a low confidence level because although there are some concerning factors, they aren't strong enough to definitively label this as high risk. She seems capable but may need support for her drug use and mental health.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
