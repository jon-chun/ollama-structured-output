    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female. Age is relatively young, which might not be a strong indicator on its own. Being White doesn't inherently make someone higher or lower risk without more context.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions can indicate past behavior that might lead to further issues. The number of prior convictions matters\u2014only one here, but it still counts.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, weight 163 lbs. These are standard measurements; nothing jumps out as problematic in terms of physical risk factors like BMI unless she's morbidly obese, which isn't the case here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor sometimes but depends on other circumstances. Being single might not directly correlate with higher risk without more context.\n\nShe has a associate or junior college degree and is in a 2-year program. Education level usually correlates with lower risk, especially if she's completing her studies. So this is a protective factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job stability is generally positive for reintegration into society after incarceration, so this isn't a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is generally not a serious issue compared to harder drugs like cocaine or heroin. Her recent feelings indicate she's not dealing with severe mental health issues.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month, which suggests she's mentally stable and possibly actively engaged with her life.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. Younger households can sometimes correlate with higher risk because there are more people to take care of or less supervision, but this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal events. This is a strong protective factor as religious beliefs often provide support and structure, reducing risk factors related to lack of faith.\n\nPutting it all together: One prior conviction, age 21 (which might be low risk), living situation at home with four people but she's 21, so maybe not the most concerning. She's completing her education, which is a positive indicator. No severe drug use or mental health issues in recent times. Her belief in God suggests strong support.\n\nI think the prior conviction and age might pull it slightly towards high risk, but considering other protective factors like education, living with family (though she's 21), and her religious belief, maybe it's not as high as YES. I'm leaning towards NO with a confidence of around 30%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
