    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment query step by step. So, the person is a 21-year-old female from White background, arrested once and convicted. She's 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs\u2014though height and weight can sometimes be red flags if they're outside a certain range, but in her case, she seems to check out. She's never married and living alone, which is pretty common, so maybe not a big risk there.\n\nShe has a college education up to associate level and is currently attending another 2-year school. That's solid; higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates. She held one job last year\u2014again, that seems manageable and not a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Hmm, that's interesting. If she's using marijuana without significant depression, it might indicate she's managing her substance use well or perhaps doesn't have a history of severe mental health issues linked to drug use. So maybe this isn't as high a risk.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age\u2014maybe family support is a positive here. And her religious affiliation suggests a strong moral compass, which could indicate she's seeking help and is more likely to take responsibility for her actions.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, convicted once, no history of severe mental health issues related to substance use, manageable lifestyle, education background, living alone but with family support. No signs of high-risk indicators like multiple offenses, drug abuse leading to severe behavior, or lack of support systems. So, the risk is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
