    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which might be considered a sensitive factor, but it doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting her. Since she's young and has only one arrest and one conviction, her age is actually on the lower end; younger individuals often have fewer recidivist tendencies.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That seems healthy, so no weight-related risk factors here.\n\nNot being married and living alone doesn't immediately raise concerns unless there are issues with isolation or social support, but since she's attending college, that might mitigate any risks related to living arrangements.\n\nHer education level is associate or junior college, which isn't low, but it also isn't high. Being enrolled in a 2-year college suggests she's actively pursuing further education, which can sometimes reduce recidivism.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some work experience might indicate stability and ability to support herself financially, reducing risk factors related to unemployment or lack of resources.\n\nHer drug use is only marijuana in the past four years. Even though substance abuse can be a risk factor, since she's not using other substances like alcohol or harder drugs, this might actually lower her risk compared to someone with more severe substance issues.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can sometimes be a precursor to substance use and recidivism, but if she's not experiencing it now, that could be a positive sign.\n\nYoung age at arrest is another point in her favor because younger offenders often have different profiles and may face different factors contributing to recidivism compared to older individuals.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes provide more support and stability, which might help reduce risk factors related to family environment.\n\nLastly, she believes in God, which is a strong indicator of personal spirituality and likely provides significant moral guidance, reducing the likelihood of negative behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some minor points like her drug use history, most factors lean towards lower risk. Her age, education level, stable living situation, and positive beliefs contribute to a safer profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
