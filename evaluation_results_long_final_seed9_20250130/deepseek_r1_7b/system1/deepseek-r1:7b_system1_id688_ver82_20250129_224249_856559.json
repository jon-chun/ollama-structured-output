    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and race can be relevant in risk assessment, but without more context on how these factors are typically used, it's hard to say definitively. However, being young might reduce some risk factors since she's just starting out in life.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. Having a criminal history does increase the risk of reoffending, so this is a red flag pointing towards high risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. This makes her at the higher end of the normal weight range for her height, which might suggest she's in better shape or has a healthier lifestyle. A stable weight could indicate less substance use issues, so this might lower the risk.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might increase stress levels, potentially leading to substance abuse as a coping mechanism. However, she's stated that she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so maybe she's managing her situation well.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can correlate with lower recidivism rates because higher education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. So this could be a protective factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year, which suggests she's employed but perhaps not stable enough for long-term success. Having a job might indicate some sense of purpose, but it also depends on whether she has support systems around her.\n\n drug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance use can contribute to higher risk of recidivism if misused or dependent on other substances. However, since she's not experiencing depression now, maybe she's using it for legitimate reasons or is abstinence-focused.\n\nShe has no history of being depressed over the past month, which could be a positive indicator as people who manage stress well might be less likely to engage in harmful behaviors like drug use.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. A larger family can provide more support and stability, reducing risk factors associated with living alone or having fewer familial resources.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal events. This religious belief might provide guidance and reduce stressors, contributing to lower risk behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The key points are the prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increase risk, while other factors like education, stable job, and living in a household of four help mitigate some risk. However, without knowing more about her current circumstances or support systems, the prior offense carries enough weight to suggest a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
