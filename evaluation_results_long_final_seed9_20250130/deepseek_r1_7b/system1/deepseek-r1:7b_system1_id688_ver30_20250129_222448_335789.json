    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze this risk factor for a 21-year-old female who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White, which isn't inherently a risk factor but might be considered in some contexts. She's been arrested once; that's one offense, so not too severe yet. Her conviction means she has past criminal behavior, which can indicate responsibility issues or previous poor decisions.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That makes her quite tall for her age but average weight-wise. Maybe she's physically active? I'm not sure if height affects risk assessment here directly.\n\nNot married and living alone\u2014she might be dealing with some independence challenges, which could sometimes lead to higher risk behaviors, though it depends on other factors.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is in a 2-year program. Education can influence behavior; perhaps she's motivated but maybe not actively using that education for positive outcomes yet.\n\nShe held one job during the year\u2014job experience might suggest some stability, which could be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is generally less severe than harder drugs but can still affect mental health. Not feeling depressed now doesn't negate past issues.\n\nYoung household size of four\u2014she's part of a family, so maybe social support could mitigate risk factors.\n\nHer belief in God might indicate a strong moral compass, which could be protective rather than harmful.\n\nPutting it all together: She has one prior offense and is now convicted. That's significant because re-offending potential increases with each conviction. However, she seems to have some positive traits like education and possibly being single. The lack of recent depression despite drug use might suggest better mental health management. Her family background and belief in God are mitigating factors.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low risk but not zero. Maybe a 30% confidence level because while she has prior convictions, other factors like her current situation and personal beliefs could offset some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
