    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for someone who's a 21-year-old female White. She's been arrested once and convicted. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the fact that she's been arrested once might indicate some prior criminal history, which is already a red flag. Convictions can be a strong indicator of past behavior issues. Then, considering her age\u2014she\u2019s 21\u2014it's early in her life, but that alone doesn't negate past issues.\n\nHer weight and height are mentioned as 6'1\" and 163 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics typically predict risk unless there's a medical condition, which isn't indicated here. So maybe not much to consider there.\n\nShe\u2019s never been married and is living alone. Living situation can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or stressors, but without more info, it's hard to tie that directly to risk.\n\nHer educational background: associate or junior college completed and currently in a 2-year college. Some education might mean she has goals and is motivated, which could reduce risk if she\u2019s making positive choices.\n\nShe has one job during the year\u2014employment can be a stabilizing factor as it provides income and purpose. One job suggests she's stable enough to not need multiple incomes or support services, which could lower her risk of engaging in risky behaviors like drug use or unstable living situations.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This is interesting because sometimes substance use can be related to stress or other factors. Since she's not feeling depressed now, it might indicate that she's managing her use better, which could suggest lower risk.\n\nHousehold size at a young age was 4\u2014that means she had siblings around when she was younger. Having multiple living together can lead to more social interactions but also potentially more stress or substance use if the household wasn't stable. However, without knowing family dynamics now, it's hard to assess.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has a strong moral framework and might be less likely to engage in risky behaviors driven by external pressures. This could lower her risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: one conviction is significant, but her age means she hasn't had many opportunities for positive reinforcement yet. Her living situation alone isn't a strong indicator unless there's evidence of instability elsewhere.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards a high risk because of the prior arrest and possible lack of support systems in her current environment. The other factors don't strongly mitigate that risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
