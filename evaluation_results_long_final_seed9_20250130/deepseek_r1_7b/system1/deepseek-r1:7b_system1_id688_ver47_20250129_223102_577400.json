    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual described. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female. Age is typically not a strong indicator of immediate recidivism risk unless there's a history of criminal behavior at that age. Her race could be associated with certain stereotypes, but without specific data on systemic issues or personal factors related to her race, it might not play a significant role here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which does increase the risk compared to someone with no criminal history. The type of offense isn't specified, so I can't assume it was severe or minor, but even a single conviction is more than just a warning.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, weight 163 lbs \u2013 these are standard measurements and don't directly relate to risk unless there's an issue with her health that could affect recidivism. Since no such issues are mentioned, this factor doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nShe's living alone, never married, and currently in a relationship? Wait, the description says she has not felt depressed over the past month but doesn't mention if she is currently dating someone. If she were dating, that might be a risk factor related to domestic violence or other behaviors, but since it's unclear, I'll note this as something to consider.\n\nShe completed an associate/junior college and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can correlate with lower recidivism rates, so having some education reduces the risk compared to those without any formal education. However, she's still in school, which might indicate she's motivated to change her situation.\n\nShe held one job during the year \u2013 this could be a positive sign as employment often correlates with better outcomes and reduced likelihood of reoffending. One job suggests stability and responsibility.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes lead to other issues, but since she's not experiencing depression now, it might indicate she's managing her substance use or is abstinence-driven. This doesn't necessarily increase risk unless there are other drug-related problems.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month \u2013 this is a positive indicator as depression can be linked to higher rates of criminal behavior. Since she's not depressed, that's a good sign and lowers the risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. This could relate to family dynamics or socioeconomic status. If the household was stable or supportive, it might have a positive impact on her, but if unstable, it could be a risk factor. Without specific details about the family environment, this is less directly relevant.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal events \u2013 this indicates a level of religiosity and spirituality. This can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates as individuals who engage in moral practices may be more inclined to change their behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior arrest and conviction, age 21 (no history yet), some education, single living situation, not in a relationship based on the description, moderate employment, drug use but no recent depression. The factors that increase risk are limited here. While she has a prior offense, her current stability, education level, and lack of recent mental health issues lower the overall risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
