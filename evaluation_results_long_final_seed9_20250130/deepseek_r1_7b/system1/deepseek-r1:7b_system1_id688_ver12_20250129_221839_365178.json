    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age and race can be significant in risk assessments, but without specific data on how these demographics correlate with recidivism or other risks, I might lean towards caution unless more info is available.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction usually indicates some level of criminal history, which could suggest past behavior that might contribute to future risky behaviors.\n\nHer height and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs. These are within a typical range but don't immediately indicate high risk unless combined with other factors like body fat percentage or health issues, which aren't provided here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone.\u5355\u8eab\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u72ec\u81ea\u751f\u6d3b\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b64\u72ec\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u5979\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6708\u6ca1\u6709\u611f\u89c9\u8fc7\u6291\u90c1\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8bf4\u660e\u5979\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u51b5\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year college. Educational attainment can influence risk behaviors; however, having some formal education might indicate responsible behavior compared to those with no education.\n\nShe's held one job during the year, which suggests she's employed or at least has income sources, reducing dependency on criminal activities for sustenance.\n\nHer drug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While occasional drug use isn't necessarily a red flag, not feeling depressed could indicate better mental health management.\n\nShe lived in a household of size four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes correlate with different social environments and support systems, which might influence her risk factors differently compared to smaller households.\n\nHer belief in God: Religious affiliation can impact behavior; some religious groups may have certain ethical standards that could reduce risk, while others might have more permissive views.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, there's a mix of indicators. No clear high-risk signs like multiple prior convictions, significant drug use leading to complications, or unstable living conditions are present here. The factors seem balanced without pointing towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
