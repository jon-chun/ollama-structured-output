    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess whether this risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Her age might not be directly indicative of risk unless she's in a situation that suggests higher propensity, but at face value, it's neutral.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. Convictions do carry some risk factors, but since this is her first offense, the impact might be less severe compared to multiple convictions.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 163 lbs. These are standard measurements, so no immediate red flags here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone.\u5355\u8eab\u4e14\u72ec\u81ea\u5c45\u4f4f\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u6709\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u3002\n\nShe has a associate or junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year college. Education can sometimes be a protective factor, especially with higher education levels, but her current enrollment might indicate she's seeking better opportunities.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some employment suggests stability, which is generally positive for risk assessment.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This could be concerning because drug use can lead to behavioral issues or legal problems, especially if it affects her ability to perform at work or maintain relationships.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone again, which I mentioned earlier\u2014this is positive.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. This might indicate family support, which could be protective unless there were issues within the family that affected her.\n\nConsidering her religion, she believes God has something to do with her personal fate. Religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with more prosaic behavior but don't directly point to criminal tendencies.\n\nPutting it all together: The most concerning factor here is the drug use (marijuana) without recent signs of depression. However, since this is a minor offense and she's otherwise stable, the risk isn't particularly high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
