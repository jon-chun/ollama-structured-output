    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female identified as White. Age isn't inherently predictive of risk unless it's significantly above or below typical risk profiles, which usually consider adults older than 25 as high risk. At 21, that might not be enough yet. So maybe low risk here.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. That's a past criminal history, but it depends on the type of offense. If it was minor or expunged, it could reduce the risk. But since it's just an arrest and conviction without specifics, I'll note this as moderate risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. That makes her fit, but physical characteristics alone don't determine risk unless they're linked to other factors like substance abuse or health issues.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Being single and living alone can be a red flag for various risks like domestic violence, identity theft, or substance abuse. But without more info on these areas, it's hard to tell. So maybe low to moderate risk here.\n\nShe has an associate/junior college degree and is in a 2-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower risk because higher education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. So this would lean towards low risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year, which suggests she's employed but maybe not stable financially. Job experience can be linked to risk if it's inconsistent or low-paying, but again, without more info on that, I'll assume moderate risk based on just having a job.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone isn't a strong indicator unless there's a history of substance abuse leading to legal issues. Her lack of recent depression might suggest she's managing well, so maybe lower risk here.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to more people sharing responsibilities and potential stressors like domestic issues or economic strain. This could be moderate risk.\n\nLastly, her belief in God suggests religious involvement, which is generally associated with lower risk as opposed to superstitious behavior linked to higher risks. So this leans towards low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Moderate risk because of the past arrest and living situation in a household of four at an early age. The other factors like education, job, and no recent depression are positive indicators but don't outweigh the negatives enough.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\nThe prediction is NO with a confidence level of 65%. This suggests that while there are some risk factors present, such as past arrest and living in a household of four at an early age, the overall risk profile leans towards moderate but not high. The positive factors like education, job experience, lack of recent depression, and religious involvement help mitigate the risk.",
