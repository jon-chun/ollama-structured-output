    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age 21 might be considered at a stage where she has had limited time in various situations that could contribute to risk behaviors. Her race doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there are systemic issues, but I don't have information on that.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction can sometimes signal past problematic behavior or substance abuse, which might increase the risk of future issues. However, since she's completed her associate degree and is in college, perhaps her education level mitigates this risk a bit.\n\nShe is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. While height doesn't directly correlate with risk, weight could be an indicator if it were more than the industry average for her job. But without knowing her job or activity level, I can't say much about body fat percentage.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living independently might reduce stress from family dynamics that could otherwise contribute to risky behaviors like drug use or antisocial activities.\n\nShe completed associate/junior college and is currently in a 2-year program. Higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and life skills, which can reduce risk factors. Plus, attending college shows she's actively working towards her future.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Single employment might indicate stability, though it could also mean limited support networks or opportunities for growth. However, since she's in college, maybe she's looking to improve her situation beyond just having a job.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana). Drug use is a significant risk factor for various issues like substance abuse disorders, which can affect mental health and legal behavior. It also increases the likelihood of future criminal encounters or self-harm.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While some degree of stress is normal, chronic stress without depression might suggest she's managing her mental health well enough to not engage in risky behaviors related to mood disorders.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Larger households can sometimes provide more support and stability but may also introduce peer influences that could be positive or negative. Without knowing the composition or dynamics of this household, it's hard to assess its impact on her risk behavior.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This religious belief might influence her decision-making regarding risky behaviors. If she feels guidance from a higher power, she might make different choices compared to someone without such beliefs, potentially reducing the risk of negative outcomes.\n\nConsidering all these factors, her single conviction and drug use are concerning but not necessarily life-threatening unless combined with other high-risk indicators like substance abuse disorders or unstable family environments. However, given that she's in college and has a job, her overall risk might be moderate rather than extremely high. Her age also suggests she may still be making decisions without full understanding of the consequences.\n\nI should rate this as low to medium risk because of her education level and stable living situation, but the drug use is a red flag that could lead to more significant issues if not addressed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
