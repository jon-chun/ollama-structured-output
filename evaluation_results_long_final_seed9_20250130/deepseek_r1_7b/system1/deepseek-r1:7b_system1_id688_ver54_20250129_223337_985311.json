    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factor for a 21-year-old female who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might indicate she's still developing life skills, but that could also be a sign of immaturity. Her race is White; I'm not sure how that factors in here because risk isn't inherently tied to race unless there are systemic issues at play.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. A single prior offense can sometimes signal potential for future behavior if not properly addressed. But since she's now enrolled in college, maybe she's working towards betterment.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, and weight is 163 lbs\u2014doesn't seem out of the ordinary, but without context on body type or previous health issues, it's hard to assess here.\n\nShe's single and living alone. Living independently can be a protective factor because it shows she has some self-reliance, which might translate into better decision-making skills.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so that's a positive sign.\n\nShe worked one job during the year. Even though working can be a motivator, having only one job at 21 might indicate she hasn't yet found steady employment or maybe is still exploring her career path.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both positive and negative impacts; since she's not experiencing depression now, it might suggest she's managing substance use effectively or perhaps she's not heavily using them anymore.\n\nHousehold size at a young age was 4\u2014could indicate family support, which is generally protective against risk factors related to family dynamics if the environment was stable.\n\nHer belief in God: Religious affiliation can influence risk-taking behavior. If she has a strong religious community, it might provide support and accountability, reducing her risk.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are some red flags like prior arrest, lack of steady employment, and living alone, other factors like higher education and positive drug use trends suggest she's motivated towards betterment. However, the single prior conviction is a significant point that should be considered in assessing her risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
