    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query from someone who's asking me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They want me to analyze certain risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk. The output needs to be a JSON object with \"prediction\" as either YES or NO and \"confidence\" as a number between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context here. The person is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. She's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises some red flags because prior convictions are often associated with higher recidivism rates. Her physical description is 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs, but I don't know how that factors into risk assessment beyond maybe looking for signs like being underweight or having health issues.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a red flag because people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness might not have the same level of support. Her educational background includes an associate or junior college degree and she's currently enrolled in a 2-year college, which suggests she's still active in education and may have good work habits.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having recent employment is generally positive as it shows responsibility and financial stability, but if she lost her job recently, that could be a risk factor. She used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana\u2014marijuana use isn't typically as strongly linked to recidivism as harder drugs like cocaine or heroin, but any drug use can indicate potential substance abuse issues.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is interesting because chronic depression is a known risk factor for substance abuse and possibly more severe crimes. Not feeling depressed might suggest she's in better mental health, which could be protective.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. Small households can sometimes correlate with higher levels of stress or neglect if the family isn't functioning well, which might impact her risk factors like substance use or antisocial behavior.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can influence risk behaviors; for example, some people might turn to religion as a coping mechanism but others may have inconsistent values that could lead to criminal behavior if not monitored.\n\nNow, putting this all together: A prior conviction is a strong indicator of past behavior that could impact future decisions. Her living situation alone at 21 can be concerning, especially without a stable support network. Drug use and lack of depression might suggest she's managing her substance abuse well but could also indicate underlying issues if she were to relapse.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014prior conviction, living alone, drug use\u2014it seems like there are enough red flags to consider her as high risk. Her confidence level should reflect a moderate assessment since while prior convictions and living situation are significant, other factors like education and employment might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
