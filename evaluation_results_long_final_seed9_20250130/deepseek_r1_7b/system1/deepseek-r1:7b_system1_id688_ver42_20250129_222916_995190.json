    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age-wise, she's in her early twenties, which might be considered low risk compared to older individuals with more life experience and potential for higher substance use or other issues.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, but since it's her first conviction, maybe that doesn't add much weight unless it's a serious offense or if she's on probation. She's described as having completed an associate degree and is currently enrolled in another 2-year college. Education can sometimes correlate with more stable environments, so this might actually lower the risk.\n\nShe is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. Those measurements don't immediately raise red flags regarding weight or BMI unless combined with other factors like prior drug use, but she's only mentioned marijuana in the past four years. Her weight isn't explicitly indicated as problematic, so I'll set that aside.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living independently can be a sign of responsibility and self-reliance, which might correlate with lower risk scores. She has held only one job during the year, which could indicate some instability or underemployment, but without more context on her work history or issues related to that job, it's hard to gauge.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Drug use can be a significant risk factor if it leads to substance abuse, mental health issues, or criminal behavior. However, she hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might suggest she's managing her substances well or not using them frequently enough.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. That suggests she was part of a multi-person household as a child, which could indicate different living conditions than what she has now. It doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there were issues in those households that aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe believes in God and considers it to be a significant influence on her life. This religious belief can sometimes lead to substance abuse or self-harm as coping mechanisms, but since she's not currently using drugs, maybe this is positive.\n\nPutting all these together: one prior arrest, education level, current student status, no recent drug use (except marijuana in the past), living independently, young age with a stable household. These factors might lean towards low risk. However, her being White and the potential for any underlying issues not mentioned could still be a consideration.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NO\" because the factors seem to indicate she's in a relatively stable situation without significant high-risk indicators like multiple drug uses, severe mental health issues, or a history of violent offenses.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
