    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the given individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female with one prior arrest and a conviction. That doesn't immediately jump out as high risk, but age is quite young, which might be a mitigating factor.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That's a bit on the taller side without being heavy, so she's of average or maybe slightly above average weight for her height. Not sure if that affects risk assessment here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher risk in some contexts due to lack of supervision, but since she has support from church, maybe that mitigates it a bit.\n\nShe has an associate degree and is attending a 2-year college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this might not indicate high risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employed individuals generally have better outcomes than those who are unemployed or on welfare, but again, her religious affiliation might provide some support.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes be a sign of underlying issues, but not necessarily high risk if she's been sober for a while now. Her lack of recent depression also seems positive.\n\nHousehold size at young age was 4. Larger households might have different dynamics, but since her current household is just her and one other person (since she's living alone), it doesn't seem directly relevant here.\n\nBelieves in God: Religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor against certain types of recidivism by providing moral support or guidance.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are some risk factors like prior arrest and drug use, several mitigating factors are present. Her education level, stable living situation (albeit currently alone), job experience, and religious belief suggest she's in a favorable position. Therefore, I would rate her risk as low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
