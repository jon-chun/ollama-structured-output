    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factor profile for a 21-year-old female to determine if she's at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's 21 and White. Age might not directly indicate much without more context, but being young could be a positive risk factor as she has fewer life experiences that might contribute to negative behaviors. Her race isn't a direct indicator of risk unless there are systemic factors at play, which I don't have information on.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which does indicate some criminal history but since it's only once, the impact is likely moderate.\n\nHer height is 6'1\" and weight 163 lbs. These physical attributes don't directly relate to risk unless there's an issue with health or substance use, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because she might have fewer social support networks, but it also allows her more freedom, so the effect could be mixed depending on other factors.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is in 2-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower risk if completed, but she's still in college, which suggests ongoing pursuit of education might mitigate some risks.\n\nShe holds one job during the year. Having a stable job can contribute to positive outcomes, so this might be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning because even non-psychoactive drugs like marijuana can have negative consequences. The fact that she's not feeling depressed now doesn't negate past drug use; it could indicate she's using it recreationally, which might be a risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but past behavior is more relevant than recent feelings unless there's evidence of current mental health issues.\n\nYoung household: At a young age, living with three others. Young households sometimes have different dynamics, possibly less stable family structures or higher turnover rates which might influence personal risk factors she doesn't mention here.\n\nShe believes in God. Belief in a higher power can provide moral support and reduce substance abuse, so this is a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The one prior arrest could indicate some risk, but since it's only once, the impact is likely moderate. Drug use past four years, especially marijuana, raises concerns about potential substance abuse issues. She's young, which might limit her life experience but not directly correlate to risk unless she's involved in risky activities. Her living situation alone isn't a strong indicator without more info.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the risk is moderate. So, my prediction would be \"YES\" with high confidence because despite some mitigating factors like education and single living status, the prior arrest and drug use suggest underlying issues that could lead to higher risk in certain areas.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
