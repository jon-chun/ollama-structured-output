    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately makes me think she has some criminal history. Convictions are usually a red flag in risk assessment because they can indicate past behavior that might lead to future issues.\n\nShe weighs 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs. I'm not sure how height relates here unless it's about body type or something else, but maybe weight is more relevant? She hasn't been married and is living alone, which could be a sign of instability, though it might also just reflect her personal choice.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year program. Education level can influence risk factors; sometimes higher education is associated with lower recidivism rates, but that depends on other factors too.\n\nShe's employed one job during the year. Having some income might reduce risk because she can support herself better, but it's not a huge factor alone.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use could be a concern, especially if it's frequent or recent, as it might affect judgment and decision-making.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Shared living can sometimes lead to social isolation or dependency issues, which might influence risk factors like substance use or antisocial behavior.\n\nHer religious belief is that God has something to do with her personal happenings. Religious factors can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates due to community support and values, but it's not always a guarantee.\n\nPutting this all together, the key points are the prior conviction, which suggests past criminal behavior; drug use history; living in a household of four at young age, which might indicate family dynamics or environment; and maybe some indicators like weight relative to height (BMI) could be a factor. Her education is ongoing but not completed yet. She's employed one job.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NO\" because she has a prior conviction, but the other factors don't necessarily stack up to create a high risk. However, her being White might add some context if there are stereotypes involved, though that's more of an assumption.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
