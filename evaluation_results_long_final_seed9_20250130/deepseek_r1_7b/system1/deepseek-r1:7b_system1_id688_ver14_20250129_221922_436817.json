    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate high risk for someone. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age might not be directly predictive unless there's something about being younger that relates to recidivism rates, but generally, youngerConvicts have lower recidivism. Her race could be a factor depending on systemic issues, but I'm not sure how strong that is here.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction can increase risk, especially if it's for a serious offense. But since she only has one, maybe the impact isn't too high yet.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That doesn't immediately indicate anything about her behavior or risk. Maybe height relates to something else like reach, but no, I don't think so here.\n\nLiving alone is interesting. Being in a single might affect support systems at home, which could influence her ability to seek help if needed. But it's not necessarily a direct indicator of high risk unless she's unstable.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Similar to above, living situation but no clear link yet.\n\nHer education level is associate or junior college and currently in 2-year college. College attendance can sometimes correlate with better job prospects and lower risk if she's completing it. But not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Unemployment for that long might suggest she has struggled, but holding one job isn't bad per se.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Some substance use can be linked to higher risk behaviors, but since it's only marijuana and she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe not a big issue here.\n\nNo recent depression. That's positive; no mental health issues that I know of.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at young age. Larger households sometimes have more support, which could be beneficial or might indicate a stressful home environment if there were conflicts. But again, not directly linked to risk unless there was instability.\n\nHer belief in God: Religious affiliation can influence behavior; some people may act differently based on their faith. But without knowing specifics about her actions, this might not be significant here.\n\nPutting it all together, I don't see any red flags that would strongly indicate high risk. Maybe the prior arrest and drug use are concerns, but with only one offense, low drug use (marijuana), and no recent mental health issues, it seems like she's a low to medium risk individual.\n</think>\n\nThe person has a single prior conviction and mild substance use without recent depression, indicating stable behavior despite past legal issue. Her living situation and lack of recent mental health issues further suggest stability.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
