    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for someone who's a 21-year-old female White. She has one prior arrest and a conviction. Her height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. She hasn't been married and is living alone. She has an associate degree from junior college, is currently in a two-year college, and has held only one job recently. She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed in the last month. She lived in a household of four when she was younger, and she believes God influences her personal events.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: One prior arrest with a conviction. Repeated criminal behavior can indicate higher risk for future offenses or substance use issues.\n2. **Demographics**: Being White doesn't directly correlate to risk unless there are systemic factors at play, which isn't indicated here. Her age of 21 is relatively young, so maybe less recidivism, but it's a factor since she might still be developing.\n3. **Physical Characteristics**: Height and weight don't seem relevant here. No direct link to criminal behavior or risk without more context.\n4. **Marital Status and Housing**: Living alone suggests she may have less support network, which could contribute to substance use issues but not necessarily higher risk unless there's instability elsewhere.\n5. **Education Level**: Currently in a two-year college, which might indicate she's committed to furthering her education, reducing the risk of substance abuse compared to those with lower education levels.\n6. **Employment**: Only one job in the past year suggests possible underemployment or high stress, but it also could mean she's managing responsibilities well.\n7. **Drug Use**: She used marijuana recently and hasn't felt depressed.Marijuana use can sometimes lead to increased risk of other substance use issues, which might affect her ability to function or commit further offenses.\n8. **Household Size at Young Age**: Living with four family members could indicate a supportive environment initially but doesn't directly relate to current risk factors unless there's a change in household dynamics later on.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a prior conviction, which is a significant factor pointing towards higher risk. Her age and education level suggest she might be managing her situation better than someone older or less educated. The mention of marijuana use could contribute to substance abuse issues, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, that might indicate self-regulation. The household size at a young age isn't directly linked to current risk unless there's ongoing family issues.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of a prior arrest and potential substance use are strong indicators pointing towards high risk despite other mitigating factors like education level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
