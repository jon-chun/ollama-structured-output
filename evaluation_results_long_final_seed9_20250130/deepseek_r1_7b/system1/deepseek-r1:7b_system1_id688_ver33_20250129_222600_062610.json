    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White, which doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless there's a specific stereotype involved, but it's not enough on its own. She has one arrest and one conviction, so that's some criminal history. Age is 21, which might be more prone to risk behaviors as they enter adulthood.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. That's a bit above average for her age but doesn't immediately indicate high risk unless there's an underlying condition or if she's in poor health.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which might suggest some independence, but it could also mean she's managing her situation without support, possibly putting her at higher risk of dependency issues.\n\nHer education level is associate/junior college and currently in a 2-year college. This might indicate she's still developing professionally, which can be risky if not managed properly, as she may face job instability or earn less than needed for long-term stability.\n\nShe has one job during the year, which suggests some income but also limited economic independence. Job loss could be significant if it's her primary source of income.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a red flag because even non-integer drugs like marijuana can have negative effects on health and relationships, though without depression, this might not directly correlate to high risk unless she has other issues.\n\nHer mental health hasn't been an issue since drug use; she's not feeling depressed now, which is a positive sign. It suggests she's managing her current state well.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four at a young age could mean family support or perhaps some stress from living with multiple siblings. Without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to assess if that affects risk behavior.\n\nHer religious belief in God might provide some stability but doesn't directly relate to risk factors unless she has fears or phobias related to religion, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nPutting this all together: one arrest and conviction suggest some criminal history. Her job situation is limited with just one job. She's young at 21, which can be a double-edged sword\u2014could mean potential for positive change but also dependency on temporary income. Her living situation alone might contribute to stress or isolation, increasing risk of substance abuse or other issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors together without knowing her current circumstances beyond what's provided, I would lean towards high risk. However, the confidence is moderate because some factors point towards risk and others don't completely negate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
