    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female. At this age, she's still young and in the prime of life, which might be a lower risk compared to older adults or those with more life experience. She identifies as White, but I don't think race plays a significant role here unless there are systemic issues, which aren't mentioned.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction can indicate some level of criminal history, but since it's just one, maybe not too high risk yet. However, the fact that she's completed her associate degree and is in college might mean she's proactive about her education and seeking better opportunities, which could reduce risk.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Her height isn't extremely tall or short, but weight can be a factor. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so mental health seems stable for now.\n\n living alone suggests she might not have family support, which could increase risk if other factors aren't favorable. But she's done her education and is attending college, which could indicate she's looking to improve her situation, possibly reducing risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some employment history can be positive as it shows she can take care of herself financially. However, only having one job might limit her earning potential if she needs a higher income for stability.\n\n drug use in the past four years was marijuana; not much is known about this. Generally, recent drug use isn't necessarily a huge risk unless it's more frequent or severe. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good news.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age, meaning she had siblings. This might suggest she has family support now, but again, without knowing how that affects her current circumstances, it's hard to say. Her religious beliefs indicate she has some spirituality, which can aid mental health and provide motivation for positive behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, the single conviction is a point against her, but other factors like education, job history, and living situation suggest she might be motivated towards betterment. The recent lack of depression also supports lower risk. So, maybe not high risk.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has a relatively low risk profile based on her current circumstances. She has made positive steps through education and employment and shows signs of good mental health. Her family background could offer some support despite living alone.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
