    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White. I don't think race is a primary factor in most risk assessments unless there are specific studies showing otherwise, but generally, it might not be the main concern here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. Being arrested even once can indicate some level of criminal behavior, which could suggest past issues that might affect her ability to manage responsibilities now.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't see a direct correlation between body type and risk here unless there's an issue with weight management or health problems, but the data doesn't mention anything about her health beyond drug use.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Single status can sometimes be associated with higher risk of involvement in certain risky behaviors due to societal pressures or lack of support from a partner. Living alone also means she has to manage all responsibilities herself, which could potentially increase stress levels.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently enrolled in 2-year college. Education level can correlate with lower risk because higher education often comes with better job opportunities and financial stability. However, her current enrollment might indicate some instability or need for support, but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having a job suggests she has some income stability, which is generally positive for managing daily expenses and reducing stress related to poverty or unemployment.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only). While occasional drug use might indicate potential substance abuse issues, she hasn't felt depressed recently. This could be a mitigating factor as it shows no current mental health issues that tie directly to risk.\n\nShe was living with a household of size 4 at a young age. The size of the household can influence stress levels and social support. Smaller households often provide more individual space, which might reduce stress but could also depend on family dynamics. However, she's now living alone, so maybe that's a different situation.\n\nShe considers God to have some role in her personal life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective of behavior if they involve accountability or moral guidance, but it's not directly indicative of high risk unless there are issues with belief in sinning or neglecting religious duties.\n\nPutting this all together, the main factors that could indicate higher risk are being recently arrested and potentially the jobless status despite having an education. Her living situation alone might increase stress but without more info on her support system now, it's hard to say definitively. The lack of recent depression and controlled drug use suggests she's managing these areas well.\n\nI'll assign a prediction of YES with 40% confidence because while there are some risk factors like past arrest and single living situation, the mitigating factors like education, job holding, and controlled substance use bring down the overall risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
