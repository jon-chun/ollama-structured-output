    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White and 21 years old, which doesn't immediately raise concerns but could be relevant in terms of systemic issues or certain stereotypes. She has one arrest and one conviction\u2014so only minor prior offense. convictions alone don't always predict future behavior unless it's a serious crime, but since it's just an arrest, maybe not too high risk.\n\nShe is 6'1\" tall and weighs 163 lbs. This might be relevant in terms of her ability to commit certain types of crimes or engage in activities that could lead to harm, like driving under the influence if she had a DUI, but there's no evidence here about substance use beyond marijuana.\n\nShe's never married and living alone\u2014living situation can sometimes correlate with risk factors. Single adults might be more susceptible to isolation leading to substance abuse or other risky behaviors, but again, without more info on her behavior, it's hard to tell.\n\nHer educational background is associate/junior college and currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Higher education can correlate with lower recidivism rates because of increased job opportunities and better life skills, so this might actually reduce the risk.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year\u2014job tenure can be a factor; someone employed for a short time might be more prone to substance use if they're struggling financially or dealing with stress. But without info on her current situation or mental health, it's speculative.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana) is present but recent denial of feeling depressed over the past month. So she's using marijuana, which isn't severe, and not experiencing depression recently. This might indicate mild substance use rather than a significant drug abuse problem.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age\u2014size doesn't inherently correlate with risk unless it's related to family dysfunction or lack of supervision, but again, without more info on her current living situation, it's hard to assess.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has some level of spiritual support, which can sometimes be protective against certain risks like substance abuse if she's using that as a coping mechanism. However, this is subjective and might not directly correlate with risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior arrest/conviction (minor), not much educational background beyond community college, living alone but never married, mild marijuana use without recent mental health issues. Her belief in God could provide some protective factors. The job tenure is just one, which isn't a strong indicator on its own.\n\nConsidering these points, the risk seems moderate rather than high. There are no clear signs of significant risk factors like multiple offenses, substance abuse leading to harm, or unstable family environment that directly correlates with risk. Therefore, I wouldn't rate this as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
