    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. Her age and race might not directly contribute much on their own but can be considered in context.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction could indicate some past behavior issues or legal trouble, which might suggest she could have ongoing issues.\n\nHer physical characteristics are 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. While height and weight can relate to potential risk factors like substance use (she used marijuana in the past four years), but without specific information on BMI or body mass index, it's hard to assess here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or financial instability, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment can be related to risk if she's not completing her studies or if she's struggling academically, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job experience isn't directly tied to risk unless it relates to substance use or financial stability, which aren't provided.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a significant factor. Drug abuse can increase recidivism rates and is a known risk factor for future criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. No information on mental health issues beyond this could relate to risk factors like substance use or employment stability.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Household size might indicate family support but doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless combined with other negatives.\n\nHer belief in God affecting her personal life is a positive factor; spirituality can sometimes lead to better decision-making and healthier behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the primary red flag here is the recent drug use. Single arrest and education don't necessarily negate this. However, she hasn't used drugs recently but has in the past four years. That's concerning because substance abuse can lead to further issues if not addressed.\n\nThe low educational level might suggest she could benefit from additional resources or support, which could mitigate risk if she gets help. But without intervention, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting this all together, there are some warning signs like prior drug use and maybe the lack of a stable living situation due to living alone, but nothing extremely alarming unless combined with other factors not mentioned here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
