    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female from White background. Age isn't inherently a strong indicator unless there's more info on past behavior at that age. She has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a red flag; prior convictions can increase risk for recidivism.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch, which is above average height, but not sure if that affects anything here. Weight of 163 lbs also doesn't seem directly relevant to risk factors unless there's an issue with BMI, but she's enrolled in a college, so maybe she's fit.\n\nLiving alone isn't necessarily bad, but if there are underlying issues like isolation or mental health problems, it could be concerning. She's never been married and currently living alone\u2014maybe she's single parent or just focused on her studies.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. College completion can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates as higher education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability, which might reduce future criminal behavior.\n\nShe held one job during the year\u2014not a lot of work history, but maybe she's looking for something more stable or just started. Drug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That's interesting; using drugs without feeling down could be a sign of casual use rather than substance abuse leading to issues.\n\nHer mental health isn't showing signs of depression over the past month, which is positive. If she hasn't felt depressed, it might indicate good mental health or minimal stressors in her life.\n\nShe lived with four people at a young age\u2014 household size can relate to stability and support, but not necessarily directly linked to risk unless there were issues within that household affecting her behavior later on.\n\nHer religious belief in God could influence her decision-making; some religious groups have different views on criminal justice and personal responsibility. However, without more info on how this affects her current behavior or mental state, it's hard to gauge its impact on risk.\n\nPutting all these together: one prior arrest increases the risk, but other factors like education, stable living situation, positive drug use (just marijuana), and mental health don't raise immediate concerns. The lack of significant risk factors outweighs the one conviction. Therefore, I would rate this as low risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
