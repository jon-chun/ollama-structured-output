    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which doesn't directly indicate anything unless there are stereotypes involved, but without more info, it's neutral. She has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction, so that's a red flag\u2014past convictions can increase risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, weight 163 lbs\u2014it seems she's in the healthy range for her age and height, so no issues there. Never married and living alone\u2014though being single doesn't necessarily mean she's at high risk unless other factors are present.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is in a 2-year college. Education level can be related to recidivism, but it depends on the program and support. She held one job last year; maybe not very stable or engaging, which might contribute to lower self-esteem and higher risk of drugs or other issues.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. While cannabis is different from heroin or meth, heavy drug use can lead to health problems and behavioral issues, potentially increasing risk.\n\nNo recent depressive episode over the past month. That's a negative indicator because if she hasn't experienced depression recently, it might mean she's coping well and less likely to be at risk for severe mental health issues.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age, which could indicate family support or potential exposure to family issues that might affect her behavior now.\n\nBelieving in God shows a positive outlook but doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are other negatives. \n\nPutting it all together: one prior conviction increases risk, unemployment (from not being employed full-time if she's studying), living alone, and past drug use. The education level is okay but could be a concern if it's unrelated to her job or life situation.\n\nI think the factors lean towards high risk because of the arrest and drug use, despite other mitigating factors like education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
