    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female. Let me go through each one and see how they contribute.\n\nShe's White, which might be a consideration if there are racial biases in the system, but at 21, she's still young, so maybe not too significant yet.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a red flag on its own because prior convictions can increase risk of reoffending.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 163 lbs. No direct info here about behavior, but maybe relates to physical activity or health issues? Doesn't seem immediately concerning.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can vary; some factors like isolation might contribute, but without more info on her environment or mental state, it's hard to tell.\n\nEducation level: associate or junior college completed, currently in 2-year college. Some education is positive, but if she's not completing her studies, maybe unstable home environment? Not sure.\n\nEmployment: held one job last year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so maybe less risk there.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use without severe issues might indicate potential for continued substance abuse, which could pose risks.\n\nYoung age at which she lived in a household of four. Younger siblings might bring more supervision or stress, but again, not directly linked to her behavior unless there's family dysfunction.\n\nHer belief in God suggests a potentially supportive home environment, which is usually positive and lowers risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest increases risk significantly, but other factors like living with older siblings might mitigate some. However, the one conviction alone points towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
