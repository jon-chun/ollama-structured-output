    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their potential impact on criminal behavior or reoffending.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age 21 might be early in her life, so I'm not sure if that's significant. Racial background can play a role but often doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are systemic issues involved.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. This is one prior offense, which could indicate some criminal tendencies, but it's only one conviction. The type of offense isn't mentioned, so I'll assume it's non-violent since she's 21. One prior arrest might increase the risk slightly compared to someone with no record.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. This is a tall, thin build. While weight can sometimes be associated with certain types of crimes, without knowing her BMI or previous weight history, it's hard to assess if this height contributes to risk.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless there are other factors like substance abuse or financial instability. Her lack of marital status might mean she has fewer social networks that could influence behavior.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education, currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can be a mitigating factor if it's leading to better opportunities, but without knowing her motivation or academic performance, it's hard to say. However, higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having employment suggests she has stable income and possibly better life choices. One job might indicate reliability but again, only one job doesn't paint a full picture of her situation.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) could be problematic. While marijuana isn't as severe as other drugs, continued substance use can lead to behavioral issues or increased riskSeeking. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which might suggest she's managing stress well, but drug use is still a red flag.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. Young households often have less supervision and more shared risk, so living with others at a young age could increase exposure to negative influences or family issues that contribute to criminal behavior later on.\n\nShe believes in God, which suggests she has a strong moral framework. This belief can sometimes lead to better decision-making but also might mean she's isolated from alternative influences, potentially increasing riskSeeking if she doesn't have supportive social networks.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior arrest, some factors that might increase risk (household size at 17-18, substance use), and mitigating factors like education and employment. Without more data on her behavior, support systems, or other risk factors like substance abuse issues beyond marijuana, the risk isn't extremely high but is noticeable enough to suggest a cautious assessment.\n\nSo I'd rate this as moderate risk with low confidence because there's not enough information to definitively say she's a high risk without knowing about other aspects that could influence her behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
