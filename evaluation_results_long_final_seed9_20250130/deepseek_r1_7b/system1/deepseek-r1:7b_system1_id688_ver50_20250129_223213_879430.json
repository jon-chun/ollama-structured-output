    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White. I know there are some racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but at 21 years old with only one prior arrest and a conviction, her race might not be a significant factor here unless there's evidence of systemic bias, which isn't present in the given data.\n\nShe has a high school diploma or associate degree. Completion of education is usually protective against reoffending because it provides opportunities and stability. So this shouldn't indicate high risk.\n\nLiving alone is another positive indicator since living with family can offer support and reduce stress related to criminal behavior, which might contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone\u2014again, that's a good sign as it suggests she's in a stable living situation without the pressures of a relationship or family responsibilities.\n\nHer education level is at a junior college, which also offers opportunities beyond just completing high school. This should be protective against risk.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. While having a job can help with financial stability and provide a sense of purpose, it's not necessarily a red flag if she was employed recently. It might actually indicate employability.\n\nHer drug use history is only marijuana in the past four years. Since she hasn't felt depressed recently, this could suggest she's managed the substance use without significant negative consequences. This is a positive factor as substance abuse can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors but here it seems controlled.\n\nHer past household size was 4 when young\u2014nothing immediately stands out about that in terms of risk factors; perhaps larger households have different dynamics, but it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are other indicators.\n\nShe mentions considering God has something to do with her life. Religious affiliation is generally associated with lower risk behaviors as people might be more committed and less likely to engage in criminal activities compared to those without such beliefs.\n\nPutting all this together, while some factors like age and prior arrest could be relevant, the presence of education, stable living situation, lack of significant drug use issues, and religious involvement all point towards low risk. There's no strong evidence here indicating high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
