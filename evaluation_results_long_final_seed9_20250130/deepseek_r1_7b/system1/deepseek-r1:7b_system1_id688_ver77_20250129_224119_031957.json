    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female White, arrested once and convicted. Being a first-time offender might not be extremely high risk on its own, but convictions carry weight. Also, her height and weight don't immediately suggest anything related to risk.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone, which is somewhat standard for someone in her age group. Education-wise, she has an associate's degree and is currently attending college, which could indicate stability or a desire to improve her situation.\n\nShe's held one job during the year, so employment history isn't negative but also not strong. Her drug use was only marijuana in the past four years, which might be less impactful than other substance issues. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive but not directly related to risk factors.\n\nLiving with a household of four at a young age suggests she's experienced, maybe has some life skills from that environment. Her religious affiliation indicates her personal values and mindset, which could be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nPutting it all together, there are no red flags or strong indicators pointing towards high risk. The only negative point is the prior arrest and conviction, but since it's a first-time offense, the confidence level shouldn't be too high. Therefore, I would lean towards low risk with a confidence of around 10%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 10\n}\n```",
