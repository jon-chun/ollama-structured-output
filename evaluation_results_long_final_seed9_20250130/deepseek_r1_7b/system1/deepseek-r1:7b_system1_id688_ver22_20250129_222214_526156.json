    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White and identified as such. I'm not sure how this affects risk assessment, but maybe there are stereotypes involved, though I should be cautious about that.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is already a significant risk factor because it indicates past behavior that might lead to more issues if she decides to engage in criminal activities again.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, weight 163 lbs. Not sure how relevant this is unless there's something about her physique affecting her ability or willingness to take risks, but I don't see a clear connection here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be isolating and might increase the risk of substance abuse because she has no one to turn to for support when things go wrong.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is in a 2-year program. Education level doesn't directly indicate risk, but sometimes higher education can correlate with lower risk if she's more responsible. However, without specific information on her motivation or goals, it's hard to say.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having employment suggests stability, which usually reduces risk. But maybe she's looking for a different type of work now that could be high-risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: specifically marijuana. Drug use can lead to health issues and substance abuse problems, both of which are known risk factors.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression is a risk factor, if she's not feeling it lately, maybe her mental health is stable or improving, which could be positive.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households might offer more support and stability, but it's also possible that she experienced family issues, which could contribute to higher risk factors elsewhere.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Beliefs can influence behavior; for example, religious people might make different choices compared to non-religious individuals, but without knowing her actual behavior, this is hard to assess as a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: prior arrest (high risk), living alone (could be high risk if associated with substance use or instability), drug use in marijuana (moderate risk), and perhaps other factors. I'm leaning towards a high confidence level that she has a high risk, but not certain because some factors might mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
