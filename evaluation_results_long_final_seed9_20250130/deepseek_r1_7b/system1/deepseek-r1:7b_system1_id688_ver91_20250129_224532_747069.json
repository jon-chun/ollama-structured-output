    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for the individual based on her background. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nShe is a 21-year-old female from a White background. Age might not be directly indicative unless it suggests she hasn't had much life experience yet. Her education level is associate or junior college, which isn't low but also doesn't immediately point to high risk.\n\nHer convictions: She has one prior arrest and a conviction. This could be concerning as previous criminal history often indicates some level of risk. The number of prior convictions might suggest she's had issues in the past.\n\nShe uses marijuana within the last four years. Drug use can sometimes lead to substance abuse, which isn't directly tied to high risk but can contribute indirectly through health issues or other behaviors.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are signs of instability, but she's 21, so that might be part of her personal situation.\n\nShe holds one job during the year. Unemployment for a significant period can affect someone's stability, but holding a job suggests she has some support and is actively engaged in life.\n\nHer lack of depression over the past month is positive; not feeling depressed could indicate better mental health or no immediate stressors.\n\nYoung household size of four: This might be normal for her age group. Not sure if it relates to risk here.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has a strong spiritual support, which can aid in coping with challenges but doesn't directly correlate with high risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the prior arrest and conviction are the most concerning elements. They indicate some past behavior that might affect her ability to reintegrate into society or commit crimes again. The other factors don't necessarily point towards high risk unless there's an underlying issue not mentioned here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
