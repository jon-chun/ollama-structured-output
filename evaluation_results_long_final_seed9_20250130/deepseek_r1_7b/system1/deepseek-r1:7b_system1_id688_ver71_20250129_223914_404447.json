    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White and 21 years old. I don't think race plays a significant role in most risk assessments unless there are specific stereotypes involved, but generally, it might not be a major factor here. Age-wise, being 21 isn't typically a red flag; many people her age have had similar experiences.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction can be significant. Depending on the jurisdiction, having a criminal record can indicate past behavior that may affect future risk. However, without more context like the nature of the offense or how long ago it happened, I'm not sure if this alone is high risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. This makes her tall but also possibly underweight given her height for her weight. Being underweight can sometimes be a sign of low self-esteem, which might affect her risk behavior or decisions.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone is common among young adults, especially those who are single parents or have moved out after getting married. It doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk unless there's evidence of domestic violence or neglect, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nShe has an associate or junior college degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment can correlate with lower risk because education often leads to better job opportunities and higher self-esteem. However, it depends on her field of study and how it relates to her career aspirations.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. Having a job shows that she's employed and possibly has some financial stability. Single income sources might reduce dependency on others for support, which could be a protective factor rather than a risk.\n\n drug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both positive and negative effects; since she hasn't had depression lately, this might indicate that her drug use isn't severely impacting her mental health negatively. It's not clear if this is recent or from earlier in her life.\n\nShe has never been married. Again, as mentioned before, this is a common situation for many young adults who are single parents or have moved out after marriage without being married themselves.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. Being part of a larger family might suggest more support and stability compared to smaller households, which could influence risk factors but not necessarily as strongly as other factors like living with an abusive family member.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal life. This is a strong indicator of a higher level of religiosity or spirituality. People who have strong religious beliefs often exhibit self-discipline and integrity, which are protective against many risk behaviors such as drug abuse, criminal activity, etc.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of a conviction does suggest some past behavior that could be monitored for future risks. However, the other factors like living alone but having a job, educational background, and strong religious beliefs weigh more towards protective than high-risk indicators. Her lack of recent depression after not using drugs might also indicate better mental health.\n\nI think her overall risk level is probably low to moderate. The single conviction could be a concern, but other factors counterbalance it. She's in college, has a job, and is from a stable family environment with strong religious support, which usually mitigates risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
