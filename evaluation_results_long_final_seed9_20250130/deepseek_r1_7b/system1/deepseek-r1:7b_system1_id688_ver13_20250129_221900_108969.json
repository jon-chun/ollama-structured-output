    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White. I don't think race is a primary factor in most risk assessments unless there's specific data suggesting it's relevant here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of reoffending. But since this is her first offense, maybe the impact isn't as severe.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height or weight directly indicate risk unless combined with other factors like BMI or behavior related to health issues.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because it reduces the likelihood of domestic violence, but in some cases, being an only child or not having support might increase risk.\n\nShe has a high school associate degree and is in college. Education level generally correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this isn't a red flag.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Unemployment for that long could indicate potential instability, which might be linked to higher risk if she's not employed or if her job is insecure.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have varying effects; sometimes it's a gateway drug leading to more severe substance abuse, but if she's not experiencing negative emotions now, maybe it's less of an issue.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed in the past month. Emotional health is important, and lack of recent depression might suggest she's managing her mental health okay.\n\nYoung age: 21 is relatively young, but that alone doesn't necessarily mean high risk unless there are other factors indicating instability or neglect.\n\nHousehold size was four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes correlate with more supervision, which might be protective against certain risks like domestic violence if she's not living in an unsafe environment now.\n\nShe believes in God and sees Him as something related to her personal events. This is a strong indicator of religious involvement, which often correlates with good behavior and lower risk of recidivism compared to non-religious individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: She has one prior conviction but nothing too severe. She's educated, employed (albeit part-time), living alone, not in a large household at a young age, and has a positive outlook on her mental health and religion involvement. These factors lean more towards low risk rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
