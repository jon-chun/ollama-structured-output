    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age might not directly correlate to risk unless it's in a specific context like recidivism, but she only has one prior arrest and a conviction. So that doesn't seem high risk yet.\n\nShe uses marijuana, which is a drug use, but no alcohol mentioned. Marijuana use can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to other substances, so that's a point towards high risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's positive because depression isn't linked directly to re-offending unless it's a substance abuse issue.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a sign of instability, which might increase the risk of committing other crimes or seeking help, but without more info, it's not definitive.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in 2-year college. Education level isn't typically linked to recidivism unless it's low education leading to poor choices, but she seems committed as she's in higher education now.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having a stable job could reduce risky behavior compared to someone unemployed or working multiple jobs that might lead to substance abuse issues.\n\nPast four years: She used marijuana, which I already considered. No mention of alcohol or other drugs, so probably not an issue here.\n\nHousehold size at young age was 4. Parenting in a larger household isn't directly linked to risk unless there were disciplinary issues elsewhere, but it's not clear from the data provided.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. This is a strong indicator of her moral compass and likely responsible behavior, which reduces risk.\n\nPutting all these together: One prior arrest, one conviction, no active drug use (except marijuana), no sign of substance abuse beyond that, living alone but not necessarily unstable in terms of crime potential, educated background, job held, personal spirituality. None of the positive factors point towards high risk, and only one negative factor related to past marijuana use.\n\nSo her risk level is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
