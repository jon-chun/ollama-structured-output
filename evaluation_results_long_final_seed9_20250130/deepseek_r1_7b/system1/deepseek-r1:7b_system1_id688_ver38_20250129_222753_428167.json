    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female identified as White. Age 21 is relatively young, which might not be a strong indicator on its own. However, her race could play a role in some risk assessments.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions are often correlates of recidivism. But since she only has one conviction, it might not be as concerning yet.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 163 lbs. These factors don't directly indicate risk unless there's evidence of substance abuse or other related issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk for certain behaviors, but without more context on her living situation, it's hard to assess definitively.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a associate/junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year college. Educational attainment can influence risk factors; however, having completed some education might suggest better decision-making skills, which could lower the risk.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. Employment history isn't directly linked to risk unless it's inconsistent or if she lost her job due to issues like substance abuse.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Since she's not currently feeling depressed, this might indicate that any drug use doesn't have severe mental health implications yet.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite being a young person. If she had depression before, it could be a risk factor, but her current state is positive here.\n\nAt a young age, lived in a household of four. Being in a larger household at a younger age might suggest social factors that could influence behavior, but again, without more context on family dynamics or issues within the household, it's unclear.\n\nHer religious belief in God affects her personal circumstances. This might relate to her motivation for positive behaviors or lack thereof, but it's not inherently a risk factor unless she's dealing with religious issues affecting her life.\n\nPutting all this together: One prior arrest and conviction is notable but may not be enough on its own. She has no history of severe mental health issues in the past month. Her living situation as a young person doesn't immediately raise red flags, except perhaps for family dynamics which aren't detailed here.\n\nConsidering all factors moderately, her risk might be low to moderate. However, given only one prior offense and positive recent behavior, I'd lean towards no high risk but not entirely certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
