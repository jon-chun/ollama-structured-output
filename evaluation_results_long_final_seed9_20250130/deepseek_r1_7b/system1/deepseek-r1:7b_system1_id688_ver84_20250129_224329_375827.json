    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age 21 might be considered at risk age-wise since it's relatively young but not necessarily high risk on its own. Racial background could play a role in certain risks, but I don't have enough information here to link it directly.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction is a red flag, as recidivism can indicate higher risk of reoffending. However, the impact might be mitigated by other factors like education or job experience.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That makes her above average height and weight, which could contribute to health risks but doesn't directly point to criminal risk unless there are underlying health issues that have led to arrest.\n\nNot married and living alone suggests she might be an at-risk individual in terms of relationships or social support, which can influence behavior, but again, not a direct indicator of criminal risk.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in a 2-year program. Education level could correlate with lower recidivism rates, so this might reduce the risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment stability is another factor; having a job can provide stability and reduce criminal tendencies.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance use can be linked to criminal behavior, but without knowing if it's current or how severe, it's hard to gauge. Her lack of recent depression might suggest she's managing her substances better now.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite living alone at a young age in a household of four. This could indicate good mental health and social support from family, which might mitigate any risk factors related to isolation or stress.\n\nHer religious belief is mentioned as something she considers has influence over her personal events. Beliefs can sometimes lead to risky behaviors if they misalign with societal norms, but without more context, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nPutting this all together: The prior arrest and being a young adult might be significant, while education level and employment are positive factors that lower risk. Her living situation at home suggests she has some support, which is mitigating against higher risk. However, her drug use history could be a point of concern if it's ongoing or leads to other issues.\n\nConsidering all these points without knowing the severity of her current drug use and the exact context of her living arrangements, I think there's a moderate risk here. She has some factors that might increase risk but also enough mitigating ones. Her age being 21 is in a range where risk can still exist due to potential for future issues.\n\nSo, my confidence level would be around 55%, indicating a low to medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning indicates that while there are some mitigating factors (education, employment), the presence of prior arrest and potential drug use contribute moderately to the risk assessment. Thus, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 60%.",
