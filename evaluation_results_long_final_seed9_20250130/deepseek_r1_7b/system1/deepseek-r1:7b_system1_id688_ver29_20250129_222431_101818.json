    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which isn't inherently a risk factor but might be considered in the context of systemic issues. Next, she has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction, which is significant because past convictions can increase recidivism risk.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. I don't see an immediate issue here unless there are other factors related to weight or height that suggest potential health risks, but nothing stands out in this case.\n\n living alone suggests she might have less support network, which could be a risk factor as isolation can lead to substance use or antisocial behaviors.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Marital status alone doesn't indicate high risk unless there are other issues like financial dependency or lack of support from family.\n\nHer education level is an associate or junior college degree and she's currently at a 2-year college, which shows ongoing educational pursuit. Educational stability might correlate with better job opportunities and lower risk factors.\n\nShe held one job during the year, so her employment history isn't particularly concerning unless it indicates underemployment, but I don't see evidence of that here.\n\nHer drug use is limited to marijuana in the past four years. While substance abuse can be a risk factor, especially for things like alcohol or other drugs, only marijuana use doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Emotional well-being is important but not directly indicative of high risk unless there's a history of mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. Shared environments can sometimes lead to exposure to negative influences, which might be a minor concern but doesn't directly point to high risk without more context on the surrounding environment.\n\nHer religious affiliation suggests personal values that may promote stability or ethical behavior, potentially reducing risk factors.\n\nConsidering all these, her only significant risk factor is the prior conviction. Other factors like living alone and substance use are present but not as concerning unless they combine with other negative traits. Given the limited data points, I might lean towards low confidence in assessing high risk without more context on how these factors interact.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
