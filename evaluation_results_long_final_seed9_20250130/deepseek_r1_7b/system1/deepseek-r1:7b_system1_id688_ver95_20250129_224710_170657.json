    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this risk assessment indicates high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female White, arrested once and convicted. Generally, having a criminal history can increase risk, but since she's only been convicted once at 21, which isn't a lot of experience yet. Convictions do have an impact though; maybe it's more moderate.\n\nShe's 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight directly contribute to risk unless there are health issues or if she has a tendency towards certain types of violence, which isn't indicated here.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Being single can sometimes be associated with higher risk in some contexts, but it depends on other factors like support systems. She's not married and living alone, so maybe that's somewhat concerning but not the most significant factor.\n\nShe has a high school associate/junior college education and is currently in a 2-year college. Education level typically isn't directly linked to criminal behavior unless there's some underlying issue, but she seems committed to furthering her education, which might indicate discipline.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having a stable job can be protective as it shows responsibility, so maybe not a high risk factor here.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance use doesn't always predict future issues, but frequent drug use without significant negative outcomes might suggest she's managing her substance use well, which is positive.\n\nShe lived at a young age in a household of four. Shared living can sometimes lead to higher risk behaviors if there are underlying issues or if the environment isn't supportive, but again, not a direct indicator.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her personal events. Religious affiliation often indicates strong moral and ethical standards, which is a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The only significant risk here might be the prior conviction. Since she's 21 and hasn't had many experiences yet, maybe not a high risk overall. Her education level and stable job are positive indicators that could mitigate some risks. However, I have to consider if her prior offense raises concerns despite being young.\n\nI think her prior arrest could indicate impulsive decisions or past issues, but she's in college now, which suggests she's working on bettering herself. The lack of significant negative outcomes like depression might mean she's managing her situation well.\n\nSo overall, I don't see a high risk here. The factors are mixed, but the positive ones seem to outweigh the possible negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
