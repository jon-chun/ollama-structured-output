    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the given individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female from White background. Age is typically considered low risk unless there are other factors indicating otherwise. Her education level is associate or junior college and she's currently in a 2-year college. Educational attainment isn't directly linked to criminal risk but might indicate stability if she's completing her studies.\n\nShe has a criminal history of one arrest and one conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of recidivism. She weighs 163 lbs at 6'1\", which is on the lighter side, but body weight isn't usually a significant factor unless there are other health issues mentioned.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk if she's unstable or facing personal challenges. Her drug use history shows she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This is interesting because sometimes substance use can lead to behavioral issues, but since she's not feeling depressed now, it might indicate she's managed her use.\n\nShe earned one job during the year, which suggests some level of stability and earning capacity. However, if that job was related to criminal activity or unstable, it could still pose a risk. She's considered God as a positive influence, which is generally protective unless there are other negative influences mentioned.\n\nPutting this all together: The single prior conviction is a significant risk factor pointing towards high risk. Other factors don't outweigh the impact of that one arrest and conviction. Therefore, I would predict she has a high risk with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
