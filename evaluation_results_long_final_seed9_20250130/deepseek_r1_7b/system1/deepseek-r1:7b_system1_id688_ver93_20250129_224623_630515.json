    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which might be relevant in some contexts due to potential racial profiling issues, but since she's been arrested once and convicted, that's more important than her race here.\n\nShe\u2019s 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. Hmm, height is often associated with higher risk if it's above average because larger stature can mean more force in impacts, like car crashes. But at 21, maybe she's not very muscular yet? I'm not sure how significant her BMI is here.\n\nShe\u2019s never been married and living alone. Living alone can be a red flag for various reasons\u2014maybe less supervision, potential isolation leading to substance abuse or behavioral issues.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is in 2-year college now. Educational attainment isn't directly linked to risk unless it's lower education which might correlate with more crime-related situations, but she seems to be actively studying.\n\nShe held one job during the year, so maybe stable employment, which can reduce recidivism. Stable jobs usually have better support systems and less stressors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: only marijuana? That's a bit concerning because even if it's non-frequent, drug use can impair judgment and lead to risky situations. But she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe she's managing her substance use well.\n\nShe was at a young age in a household of four. Younger households might have different dynamics; sometimes there's more supervision or less, depending on the family structure.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her life\u2014this is generally protective against substance abuse and delinquency because she's seeking a higher power for guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a criminal history (1 arrest). Weight might suggest potential physical risk if it's high, but at 21, maybe she hasn't built much muscle. Living alone could be problematic but perhaps she's managing. Educational background seems okay. Only one job\u2014so stable but maybe not enough support.\n\nDrug use of marijuana is concerning; even occasional use can affect judgment and lead to risky behaviors. The lack of recent depression might suggest she's handling it, but substance abuse itself isn't a risk factor if managed well. However, sometimes substance abuse can be a sign of deeper issues like anxiety or stress.\n\nHer household size at 17 doesn't directly correlate with current living situation unless the dynamics have changed. Her religious belief is a positive indicator for overall behavior and substance use.\n\nSo considering all these factors: one arrest, drug use (even if brief), living alone\u2014these can contribute to high risk. The rest of the factors don't necessarily mitigate that. Therefore, I would lean towards high risk with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
