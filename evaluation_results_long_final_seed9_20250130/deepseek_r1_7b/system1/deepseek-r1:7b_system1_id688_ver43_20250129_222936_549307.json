    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given this query where someone is asking me as a risk assessment expert whether certain risk factors indicate a high risk. The person wants the response only in a JSON format with \"prediction\" and \"confidence.\" \n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors provided. The individual is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity, arrested once and convicted. She's tall at 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Not married and living alone. Her education level is associate or junior college, currently in a 2-year college. Employed one job last year. Drug use: marijuana in the past four years but no depression in the past month. Young household of four from an early age, and she believes in God's influence on her life.\n\nI need to assess each factor for its association with recidivism risk. Age 21 is quite young; younger adults often have higher recidivism rates due to developing skills or changing circumstances. Being White might not directly correlate but could be related to systemic issues if there are underlying factors, though without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe has a prior conviction, which does increase risk since previous convictions are strong predictors of future crimes. Her living situation alone isn't great for stability but maybe she's managed her situation well. Education: having some might indicate better opportunities or higher self-esteem, which could be protective. Employing one job seems positive as employment is linked to lower recidivism.\n\nDrug use: marijuana is a mild substance and not typically associated with severe issues unless there are underlying issues like depression, but she hasn't felt depressed recently. So that's mixed; no recent drug use or low depression might be protective.\n\nYoung household size could imply family support, which usually reduces risk. Her belief in God suggests strong moral values, potentially positive for behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: prior conviction is a strong risk factor (predicts high risk). Age and living situation are moderate but not directly concerning. Drug use recent negative (no depression) might be protective. Education and employment are positive signs. Young family support could mitigate any potential issues from other factors like age or prior convictions.\n\nConsidering the balance, her prior conviction is a significant red flag. The other factors seem to lean towards stability and positivity but don't outweigh the risk from past arrest. So I'd predict a high risk with moderate confidence because there's a strong indicator present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
