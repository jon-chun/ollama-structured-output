    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm faced with analyzing these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White, which doesn't directly indicate high risk but could be relevant in some contexts. She has one arrest and a conviction, which is significant because prior convictions are strong predictors of recidivism. That alone might suggest a higher risk.\n\nHer height and weight aren't immediately concerning unless there's an issue with health metrics, but she's 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs. I don't see any immediate health red flags here.\n\nShe's living alone, which can sometimes be associated with lower support systems, potentially increasing her risk of relapsing or experiencing issues if something goes wrong.\n\nHer educational background is an associate/junior college degree and she's currently in a 2-year program. College attendance is generally positive for risk assessments as it often correlates with better job opportunities and stable lives.\n\nShe worked one job during the year, which might indicate some financial stability, but not enough to completely offset other negative factors.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years isn't a serious drug use issue unless there's substance abuse that affects her ability to manage daily tasks. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which is actually a positive sign as depression can sometimes lead to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at an early age, which might suggest some family support or potential for social connections, but if she's living alone now, it could indicate a lack of support network.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her life is generally seen as positive, promoting personal accountability and self-improvement.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are some red flags like prior conviction and living alone, the factors don't seem overwhelmingly negative. The presence of education and single job might mitigate some risks. Therefore, I'd lean towards a lower risk but not necessarily high risk. My confidence is moderate at 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
