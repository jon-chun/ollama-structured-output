    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on her profile. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female. Age-wise, being 21 isn't necessarily a red flag unless it's significantly lower or higher than the typical age of first offense, but since it's just one arrest and conviction, maybe that's not too much here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's definitely a risk factor because prior convictions increase the likelihood of recidivism. So that's something pointing towards high risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, which isn't unusual, so probably not an issue. Weight at 163 lbs also doesn't stand out as concerning unless it's related to health issues, but there's no mention of that here.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because people in blended families or with support networks are less likely to engage in risky behavior. But she hasn't felt depressed recently either, which might suggest she has some level of mental health support.\n\nShe's completed an associate or junior college and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because it can lead to better job opportunities and self-sufficiency. So that doesn't point towards high risk.\n\nShe held only one job during the year, which could be a risk if she's underemployed or unstable, but again, without more context on her job performance or stability, I'm not sure how much this affects risk assessment.\n\nDrug use: she has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse can significantly increase the risk of recidivism, especially if it's been a consistent pattern. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might suggest she isn't dealing with severe mental health issues related to drug use.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Sibling count isn't typically a major factor unless there are issues like abuse or neglect, but since it's just the number without additional info, maybe not much here.\n\nHer belief in God could influence her behavior and decision-making. Some people might make riskier choices influenced by their faith, but this is subjective and hard to quantify into a risk score.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and conviction are strong indicators of high risk. Her job history, education level, and living situation don't seem to add to the risk factors. The only negative point is drug use, which could be a factor but isn't as significant without more context on her substance abuse patterns or the nature of her job.\n\nI think the prior conviction carries enough weight here to suggest high risk despite other minor factors not necessarily adding up.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\nThe presence of a prior conviction and the individual's age, along with some context about drug use, suggest that she is at least moderately high risk for recidivism. Other factors like education level and living situation don't significantly mitigate this risk.\n**Answer:**  \n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
