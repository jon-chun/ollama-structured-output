    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age might not be directly indicative unless there are specific age-related risk factors, but she's young and probably stable in terms of long-term issues.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction can be significant because it shows some level of criminal history, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates. However, since it's only one arrest, the impact might not be as severe compared to multiple convictions.\n\nShe is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. These are average measurements for a 21-year-old female. Height doesn't typically correlate directly with risk unless there are other factors related to stature, but weight isn't provided here. So maybe not much to consider from this data point.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence various aspects of behavior, such as social support and stress levels. Single individuals might have different dynamics, but again, without more info on mental health or other factors, it's hard to assess the risk solely based on this.\n\nShe has a associate or junior college education and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can impact future criminal behavior; higher education is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. However, her current enrollment might suggest she's motivated to change, which could be positive for reducing risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment status is another factor where having at least one job can indicate a sense of purpose and responsibility, potentially lowering the risk compared to someone unemployed or underemployed.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially substances like marijuana, can be linked to various behavioral issues and increased risk of other criminal activities. However, recent feelings of depression aren't provided, so it's a bit tricky. If she hasn't felt depressed recently, that might suggest she's managing her substance use without severe mental health issues.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Sibling count can influence family support and social environment. Larger households often have more people to turn to for help or support, which could potentially reduce risk factors if the family is supportive.\n\nBelief in God: She considers that God has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with prosocial behavior but might also be linked to substance use if not integrated into a healthy lifestyle. However, this is subjective and doesn't directly indicate risk without more context on how it affects her daily life.\n\nPutting it all together: There's one prior arrest which is concerning. Her drug use (marijuana) over the past four years could indicate potential substance abuse issues, which might be linked to other behavioral problems or substance-related crimes. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe her mental health isn't a significant concern here.\n\nConsidering all factors: One arrest, marijuana use, living alone, single, some education and employment. The most concerning factor is the prior arrest, but without more info on other potential risk factors like mental health issues or family dynamics beyond drug use, it's hard to say definitively if she has high risk. However, given that she has a prior conviction and substance use without recent mental health issues, her risk might be higher than average.\n\nSo, I would lean towards \"YES\" with a confidence level of 65%. It's not the highest confidence because there are factors like living situation and education working in her favor, but the prior arrest and potential drug-related issues bring up red flags.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
