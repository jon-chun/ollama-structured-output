    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this person. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female, White, with one arrest and a conviction. That might suggest some criminal history, but since it's her first offense, maybe the base risk is lower than someone with multiple convictions or more severe offenses.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That's average height and weight, so no indication of extreme obesity which sometimes ties to higher risks. Her BMI isn't provided here, but generally, she seems healthy in that regard.\n\nLiving alone is a point. Some studies suggest living with others reduces risk factors because there are more people to share responsibilities and support, especially when it comes to mental health issues like depression.\n\nShe's never been married and currently living alone. That might be associated with higher stress levels or isolation, but combined with her positive statement about not feeling depressed in the past month, that's a bit confusing. She says she hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can sometimes be linked to risk factors if they're unstable or have ties to substance use, but here it seems she's actively studying, so that might not be an issue.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Joblessness can sometimes be associated with higher risk of dependency on substance abuse, but again, she used drugs in the past four years (marijuana specifically) and hasn't felt depressed recently, which might negate some of those concerns.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years, but since it's not a severe drug like cocaine or heroin, maybe the association with risk isn't as strong. Substance abuse can sometimes lead to more risky behaviors, but without more info on other substances, I'm cautious here.\n\nPast household size at young age was 4. Being in a larger family might provide more support and reduce stressors, which could be protective against various risks.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has some level of spirituality or religious involvement, which can sometimes be linked to resilience against certain stressors but not necessarily to substance use or violence.\n\nPutting it all together: She's young, with one prior arrest, so maybe lower recidivism risk. Her positive mental health status and stable living situation reduce her overall risk. The only possible red flags are the drug use in marijuana, which could be linked to underlying issues like depression if she had it before, but she says she hasn't felt depressed recently.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think this person is not a high risk. She has mitigating factors that suggest lower propensity for recidivism or other risk-related behaviors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
