    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this risk assessment indicates a high risk for this individual. Let's break down all the factors given.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female. Age is usually considered low risk unless there are other factors indicating otherwise. Her criminal history is one arrest and a conviction, which isn't too bad but could be a red flag. Being 6'1\" and weighing 163 lbs might suggest she's not overweight, so maybe no weight-related issues.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Single status can sometimes indicate lower risk because there are fewer dependents who could offer support or encouragement. Living alone also means less supervision from family members.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is attending college, which usually indicates some level of education. Education tends to correlate with better job opportunities and higher self-esteem, which might actually be protective factors rather than risk-inducing ones.\n\nShe held one job during the year, so she's employed but maybe not in a stable position or perhaps under some strain. Joblessness can sometimes lead to increased stress or substance use, but since she's working now, that's positive.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use isn't always a strong indicator of high risk unless there are other issues like alcohol abuse or other substances. Since she's only using marijuana and hasn't had depression symptoms, it might not be a major concern here.\n\nHousehold size at a young age was 4. That means she lived with three other people when younger, which could have exposed her to different social influences but doesn't necessarily indicate personal risk unless there were issues like domestic violence or neglect in the household.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has some level of religious support and might be more stable mentally compared to someone who isn't religiously involved.\n\nPutting it all together: She's young, has a clean enough criminal history with one conviction but no active drug use (except marijuana), is educated, living alone, employed, and has a positive outlook on her mental health. The factors that could potentially increase risk aren't strongly present here. While there are some minor concerns like age of criminal record and past drug use, the protective factors seem to dominate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
