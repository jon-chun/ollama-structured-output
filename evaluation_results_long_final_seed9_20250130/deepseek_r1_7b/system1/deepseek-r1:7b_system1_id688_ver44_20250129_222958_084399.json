    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's good to note for any potential biases in the system.\n\nShe has a criminal history: one arrest and one conviction. That's significant because even if it's her first offense, recidivism is still a risk factor. I remember that having a prior conviction increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior, so that should be considered high risk.\n\nHer physical attributes are 6 feet 1 inch and 163 lbs. No immediate issues there; she might just be an average build or even athletic.\n\nShe's living alone with no dependents. Living alone can sometimes lead to higher stress levels, but it doesn't directly indicate criminal behavior unless there are signs of neglect or abuse, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a associate/junior college degree and is currently in 2-year college. Educational attainment isn't directly tied to criminal behavior, but lower education can sometimes be linked with higher recidivism rates if someone doesn't get further help.\n\nShe's employed one job during the year. Single income might lead to stress issues, but again, not directly tied to crime unless there are dependency issues or unstable living conditions.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. While substance abuse can be a risk factor for other issues like violence or accidents, the lack of recent depression isn't immediately concerning. However, past drug use can sometimes lead to risky behaviors that might increase recidivism.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone with no children. That could mean she's focused on herself, but without more info, it's hard to say if that affects her risk level.\n\nHer household size at a young age was four, which might suggest family support or lack thereof, depending on the composition. However, it doesn't directly indicate current behavior unless there are issues like abuse in the past.\n\nShe believes in God and feels some spiritual connection to her life. While spirituality can be protective against certain types of crime, it's not a direct indicator of criminal risk.\n\nPutting all this together: The most significant factor is the prior conviction. That alone should tip the risk towards high. The other factors don't provide strong enough evidence to either confirm or deny a high risk, but given her history, I'd lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction is based on the significant risk associated with the prior conviction and the overall profile indicating potential behavioral patterns consistent with recidivism.",
