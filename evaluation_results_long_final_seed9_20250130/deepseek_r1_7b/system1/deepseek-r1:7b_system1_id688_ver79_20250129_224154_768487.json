    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which doesn't immediately raise the alarm, but race can be a factor in some predictive models based on historical data. She's been arrested once and convicted, so that has a direct impact on her risk assessment\u2014convictions are usually significant indicators of higher risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, weight 163 lbs. These physical characteristics might not directly affect the risk unless combined with other factors like body type or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because it reduces social support, but without more info on her living situation stability or surrounding environment, it's hard to quantify.\n\nShe has an associate degree and is in college. Educational attainment is generally considered protective against recidivism unless she's struggling with it, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe worked one job last year\u2014so stable employment. Unemployment can be a risk factor as it can lead to financial stress or substance use without support.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse without concurrent mental health issues might not be as concerning, but frequency could still matter.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite living alone and being single. Depression can influence risk behaviors, so lack of it is positive, but maybe not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with four people\u2014household size 4. A larger household at a younger age could indicate less family support or more exposure to external factors.\n\nHer religious belief in God suggests some level of stability and possibly moral support, which can be protective against risk behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: One conviction increases the risk significantly. The other factors are mixed\u2014some negative (larger household), some positive (education, single job). Without more info on her mental health or living situation's quality, I'd lean towards moderate risk but not high.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has one prior conviction, which is a significant factor indicating higher risk. Other factors like living alone and substance use are mitigated by other protective factors such as education and employment. However, without comprehensive data on her living environment or mental health support, the overall risk remains moderate.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
