    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the given individual. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their potential impact.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female who was arrested once and convicted. That's a past conviction, which is significant because prior convictions are usually a strong indicator of recidivism. However, since it's her first offense, maybe the risk isn't as high compared to someone with multiple convictions.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. I don't know if that gives much insight into risk factors, but sometimes weight can be a factor in certain offenses or recidivism, but without more context, it might not directly indicate high risk.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone isn't inherently bad, but it could mean she has fewer social support networks, which might contribute to higher risk if there are stressors at home.\n\nShe has a associate or junior college education and is in a 2-year college. Educational attainment can be a factor; having some formal education might help with job opportunities and stability, but again, without knowing her job situation or financial status, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nShe held one job during the year. One job isn't terrible, but if she lost it due to substance use (marijuana) or other issues, that could impact her ability to support herself.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to various problems like health issues, family dysfunction, which might increase risk. However, not feeling depressed might suggest she's managing her situation better than others.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four. Young age and larger households often have different dynamics. Maybe more supervision or higher stress from living with multiple people could be a contributing factor, but it depends on the family environment.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior; however, unless there's evidence of direct harm or problematic beliefs (like substance abuse), it might not directly indicate high risk.\n\nPutting this all together: A single prior conviction could suggest some risk, but since she's young and perhaps in a better situation compared to older individuals with moreConvictions. The lack of marriagE and living alone don't immediately signal high risk without additional factors like family issues or substance abuse problems beyond drug use. Her education might help her find stable employment. She only has one job, which is manageable. Drug use could be a red flag but she hasn't had depression recently, so maybe she's managing it well.\n\nHowever, considering all these points together, I'm not sure if they collectively indicate a high risk. Without more concerning factors like substance abuse causing significant issues or multiple prior convictions, her risk might be moderate rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
