    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with analyzing several risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White, which might be considered a sensitive factor depending on the context, but alone without other indicators, it doesn't raise immediate red flags. She has one arrest and a prior conviction, which is significant because prior convictions, especially with a young age, can indicate more serious behavior history.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That translates to about 145 lbs of BMI, which is above the healthy range. Being overweight could be a risk factor for various health issues that might affect her stability or performance in areas like work or relationships.\n\nShe's never married and living alone\u2014this can be associated with higher stress levels or potential isolation. However, without more context on how she's coping, it's hard to gauge the impact directly on risk.\n\nHer education level is an associate or junior college degree and currently enrolled in a 2-year college. College enrollment suggests she has some educational goals but may also indicate lower stability if she's not completing her current program or facing academic difficulties.\n\nShe has held one job during the year, which might suggest part-time work or unemployment. Unemployment can lead to financial stress and potentially substance use issues as a coping mechanism.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana in the past four years. Even though cannabis is less severe than other drugs, continued use could impact her ability to function socially or professionally and may be linked to mental health concerns, though she hasn't felt depressed recently.\n\nHer living situation at a young age was in a household of four, which might indicate family support but also potential stress from family dynamics. Her religious belief that God has something to do with her personal life could suggest resilience, but it's not directly indicative of risk unless there are underlying issues with mental health or substance use.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one prior conviction (which is a strong indicator of past problematic behavior), BMI indicating possible health issues, living alone which might lead to stress, part-time job, drug use history, and young age of convictions. These points collectively increase the risk level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
