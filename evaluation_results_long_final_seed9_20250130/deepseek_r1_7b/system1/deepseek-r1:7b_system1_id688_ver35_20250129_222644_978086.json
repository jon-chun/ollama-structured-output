    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they might contribute to risk.\n\nFirst, she's White. I'm not sure if race plays a significant role in risk assessment beyond systemic issues, but maybe it's part of her background that could influence her behavior or support systems.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted.Conviction history can be a red flag because past convictions, especially for felonies, might indicate criminal tendencies or lack of responsibility.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't see how physical attributes directly relate to risk unless it's about access to certain areas, but that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of higher independence or lower dependency on others for emotional support, which might reduce risk in some contexts, but if she's unstable, it could increase risk.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can be linked to employability and stability. She's attending college, so maybe that's a positive sign as she's working towards something stable.\n\nShe held one job during the year. One job might indicate some dependency but could also mean she's looking for more stable employment, which is generally positive.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a concern if it leads to substance abuse or unstable behavior, but since she hasn't felt depressed, maybe that's not as concerning yet.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Sibling households sometimes have different dynamics which could influence her behavior now. However, the size alone doesn't directly indicate risk unless there were issues within the family.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has religious support and might be more disciplined or have coping mechanisms related to spirituality. This could be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a conviction history which is negative, but other factors like education, living alone, and manageable drug use balance it out. Since she's attending college and has one job, that points towards stability. The small household size might not indicate instability. Her belief in God could offer some protective factors against risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these, I think the risk is moderate to low because her conviction history isn't severe enough without other contributing factors like substance abuse or unstable personal situation. She's actively pursuing education and has a job, which are positive signs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
