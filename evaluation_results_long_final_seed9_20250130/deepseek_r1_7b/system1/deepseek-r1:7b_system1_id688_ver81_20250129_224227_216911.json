    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White and has been arrested once with a conviction. Race can be a factor in some predictive models, but it's not the most significant on its own unless there are systemic issues involved.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. I don't think height or weight alone contribute much to risk assessment without context like body fat or other metrics.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living situation can be related to stress levels, but she also hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe that's a mitigating factor here.\n\nShe has an associate degree and is in college. Education level generally correlates with lower recidivism, so this might be protective.\n\nShe worked one job last year. Employment history usually indicates stability, which can reduce risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance use without severe mental health issues might not pose a high risk if she's stable otherwise.\n\nYoung household at age of arrest (age 19). Young families can sometimes have different dynamics that might be associated with higher risk, maybe due to changes in family structure or economic factors.\n\nHer religious belief: She believes God plays a role. Religious beliefs can influence behavior and support systems, but without specific evidence of risky behavior from that belief, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting this all together, most factors seem to indicate lower risk. The only significant points are her past arrest and living situation at a young age, but they don't necessarily point towards high risk unless combined with other negative factors like drug use or unstable family.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
