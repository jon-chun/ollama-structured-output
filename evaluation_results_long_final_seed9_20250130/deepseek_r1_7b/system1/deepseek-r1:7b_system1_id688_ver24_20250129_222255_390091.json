    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a White woman. While race can be a factor in risk assessments, it's often nuanced and not the primary determinant here. She has been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises concerns about criminal history.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Her height and weight don't directly indicate much unless I consider if she might have health issues, but since she's in college, maybe she's more active or manages her weight well.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living independently can be a double-edged sword; it might suggest some level of maturity, but also independence from support systems which could be both positive and negative depending on the context.\n\nHer education background is associate/junior college and currently in 2-year college. College enrollment usually indicates stability or at least some commitment to personal development, which isn't necessarily a risk factor unless it's inconsistent with other factors.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year. This could mean she might be underemployed or facing challenges finding steady work. Job instability can sometimes correlate with higher risk of issues like homelessness or substance use if not managed well.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. This is concerning because even if it's low-level use, drug use can affect mental health and social functioning. She hasn't felt depressed in a month, which might suggest she's managing her substance use without severe mental health issues, but it's still something to consider.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Younger households often mean less supervision or more independence, which can be both positive and negative. However, the size alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless combined with other factors like living conditions or family dynamics.\n\nShe believes in God's role in her life. This is a strong indicator of religious involvement, which generally correlates with lower risk behaviors compared to non-religious individuals who might engage in risk-taking activities without a guiding force.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a criminal history (1 arrest), drug use, and living alone. These are red flags. Her age being young suggests she's still developing, but her current situation includes factors that could contribute to higher risk. The lack of marriage and living independently might place her at greater risk for instability or substance abuse issues.\n\nConsidering the components: one arrest, past marijuana use, living alone, low job stability. While not all high-risk indicators are present, enough concerning factors are there to lean towards a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
