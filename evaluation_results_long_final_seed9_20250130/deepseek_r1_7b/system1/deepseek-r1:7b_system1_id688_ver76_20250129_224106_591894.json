    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for some kind of outcome, probably criminal recidivism or something similar. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's 21 and female, White. Age might be relevant because younger individuals sometimes have different risk profiles compared to older adults. Being White could influence things like systemic issues in the justice system but I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a clear criminal history which typically indicates some level of recidivism risk, especially if she was released and then re-arrested recently.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That makes her quite tall and heavy for her height. Could this be an indicator of substance abuse? Maybe if she's struggling with weight or alcohol, but I don't see that mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors like drug use or other risky activities, but again, not directly linked to recidivism unless there are underlying issues.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year program. Education level might be inversely related to recidivism if she's going back to school, indicating better opportunities, but it depends on other factors like motivation or support.\n\nShe held one job during the year. One job isn't bad per se, but if that job was unstable or if she relies heavily on it for stability, maybe there are underlying issues.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only). Even if she's using marijuana, which is less harmful than other drugs, it could indicate potential substance abuse issues, which might increase risk of other crimes.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. If this is ongoing or frequent depression, it might be a sign, but not if she's recent and hasn't had an episode yet.\n\nAt a young age lived in a household of size 4. Small family sizes can sometimes correlate with different social dynamics, maybe higher independence, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk here.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious affiliation might influence her behavior; some religious groups have certain values that could either mitigate or increase risk depending on the context.\n\nPutting this all together, she has a criminal history, which is a strong indicator of past issues. Her living situation and personal circumstances don't immediately jump out as high risk factors, but her age being 21 might be more about the potential for future issues rather than immediate risk. However, considering she's had one arrest and conviction, that's already a significant factor.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence because of the prior conviction and other factors like drug use which could indicate underlying issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
