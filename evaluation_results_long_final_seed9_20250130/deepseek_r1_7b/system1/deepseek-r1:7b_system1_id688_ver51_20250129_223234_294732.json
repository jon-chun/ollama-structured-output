    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for some kind of criminal justice situation. The person is a 21-year-old female, White, who's been arrested once and convicted. That's already a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I'm not sure how that plays into the risk assessment here unless there's some racial disparity in the system, which is possible but maybe less so in this case since she's already been through one offense. Her height and weight don't seem directly relevant, though being tall might sometimes be associated with higher risk in certain contexts.\n\nShe's never married and living alone \u2013 that's a protective factor because living alone can reduce social support, which might increase the risk of substance abuse or isolation leading to further issues. However, she's still young, so maybe her life experiences aren't as extensive yet.\n\nHer education level is an associate or junior college degree and she's currently in a 2-year college \u2013 higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because people are more likely to get job training or better support upon release.\n\nShe worked one job during the year, which might indicate some stability but also could mean limited opportunities for alternative income sources if something happens. Her drug use history is only marijuana in the past four years \u2013 that's minor compared to other substances like cocaine or heroin, so maybe it doesn't pose a significant risk yet.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive because depression can sometimes lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors. Her household size was 4 when young, which might indicate she had some support at an earlier age, possibly mitigating her risk now.\n\nHer belief in God could be a protective factor as religious beliefs often provide a sense of purpose and can deter crime through moral accountability or community involvement.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and conviction are strong indicators of high risk. Her current job situation might offer some stability but doesn't necessarily offset the prior offense. The other factors like education, living alone, etc., have mixed effects \u2013 some protective, some neutral. However, without any additional information on her mental health beyond recent months or any specific criminal tendencies now, it's hard to see a complete picture of high risk.\n\nI think the confidence level should be moderate because while there are some risk factors like prior arrest, other protective ones balance it out, but the presence of a prior conviction is still quite significant. So maybe 50-60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
