    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for some kind of issue, probably criminal or behavioral. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nShe's a 21-year-old White female. Age might not be a strong indicator on its own unless she's younger than typical offenders, but generally, it's less predictive. Her race isn't typically associated with crime rates directly, though there are some correlations in some areas.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which is significant because having a criminal record can indicate past behavior that might predict future issues. So this could be a red flag.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, weight 163 lbs. These physical characteristics don't directly relate to risk unless there's something about her body type or presence that others find intimidating, but I don't see any information suggesting that here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Being single doesn't usually correlate with criminal tendencies unless there are underlying issues she's not revealing, but again, no info on that.\n\nEducation-wise, she has an associate degree and is in college. Higher education can correlate with lower recidivism rates because it might provide better job opportunities or life skills, so this might actually be protective rather than high risk.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. Unemployment for a long time can lead to substance abuse and other issues, but holding at least one job is generally positive.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana is mild compared to harder drugs like cocaine or heroin. Not feeling depressed could mean she's not struggling with severe mental health issues, so this might be a protective factor rather than high risk.\n\nShe's never been depressed over the past month. This suggests good mental health, which is protective against various risks.\n\nAt a young age (21) lived in a household of four. Co-habitation at such a young age can sometimes lead to higher risk behaviors if there are issues within the household or if she wasn't properly supervised. However, without more info on family dynamics or any disciplinary actions from her current living situation, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. This belief can be protective as it might provide some coping mechanism for stress or trauma but doesn't directly correlate with high risk behaviors unless there are underlying issues related to her faith that haven't been addressed.\n\nPutting this all together: One prior conviction is a strong indicator of past behavior, which could predict future criminal activity. The rest of the factors don't strongly suggest a high risk on their own, except perhaps for being single and living alone without more context about surrounding circumstances. However, one conviction already makes it significant enough to consider her as having a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
