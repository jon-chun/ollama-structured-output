    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk and then provide a JSON response with \"prediction\" as YES or NO and confidence level between 0 and 100. \n\nFirst, let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nShe is 21 years old, which might be considered a younger age for recidivism, but it depends on other factors. She identifies as White\u2014this could influence risk perception based on race, though I'm not sure if that's a strong indicator here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. One arrest isn't too bad, but conviction counts can indicate past behavior issues which might predict future criminal activity.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't think weight or height are significant risk factors unless combined with other info like BMI, but alone they probably aren't much of an indicator.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with high risk, though it might be a sign of instability. But not sure how that ties into risk assessment yet.\n\nEducation level: associate or junior college completed, currently in 2-year college. College attendance is generally protective against recidivism, so this isn't a strong risk factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Maintaining a job can help with stability and reduce risk of further involvement in criminal activities.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use might be a minor offense, not sure if it's significant enough to raise the risk flag here.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. No depression is actually a protective factor against recidivism, so that's a good sign.\n\nYoung age of living: at a young age, lived in a household of 4. This might suggest family dynamics or possible instability but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nHer belief in God\u2014religion can influence behavior and self-image. If she's religiously active, it might indicate accountability which is protective, so maybe reduces risk perception here.\n\nPutting this all together: One arrest, convictions, but other factors like education, stable living situation (though she's alone), job, no recent drug use except marijuana, no depression in the past month, and religious involvement. These points don't strongly indicate high risk; however, there is a single prior conviction which might suggest some risk. \n\nI think her risk level isn't extremely high but moderate. So maybe a confidence of 30%? That's on the lower side of medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
