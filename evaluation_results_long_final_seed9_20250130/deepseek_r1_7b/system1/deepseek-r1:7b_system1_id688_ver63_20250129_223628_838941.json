    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze these risk factors step by step. The person is a 21-year-old female, White, with one prior arrest and a conviction. She's 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs, which doesn't immediately strike me as high risk in terms of physical traits.\n\nShe's single and living alone. Single status can sometimes indicate less stability, but it also shows she's making her own choices, so maybe not the highest risk there. Her education level is associate or junior college, then pursuing a 2-year degree. College attendance suggests she's motivated to improve herself, which might be protective.\n\nShe held one job recently, which gives some work continuity and stability. That's a positive indicator against risk. Drug use history\u2014she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed in the last month. That's interesting because drug use can sometimes correlate with other issues, but the lack of recent depression might suggest she's managing it well.\n\nHer household size was 4 when young, which is a typical family size and doesn't indicate a high risk environment growing up. Her belief in God suggests a religious background, which often correlates with strong moral values and community support, potentially protective factors.\n\nPutting all this together: one arrest, conviction, single living alone, job history, education, manageable drug use, and positive mental health. These factors don't strongly indicate a high risk; instead, they suggest a person who is making efforts to improve her situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
