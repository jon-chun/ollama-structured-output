    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this risk assessment task for a 21-year-old female who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through the factors one by one.\n\nFirst off, she's White, which might have some implications on recidivism rates, but I don't know if that's significant here. She has a criminal history of one arrest and a conviction, so that's definitely a red flag. Recidivism is higher among those with prior convictions, so that's pointing towards high risk.\n\nHer demographics: 21 years old isn't very old, which might suggest she's still in her prime for re-entering the workforce or making independent decisions. Being White could be associated with lower recidivism rates, but I can't assume that without more info. Her weight is tall and average, so maybe she's active, which could reduce risk factors.\n\nShe's living alone, which is good because cohabiting reduces the chance of domestic violence incidents. She hasn't been married yet, so no spouse to potentially influence her behavior negatively. Education-wise, she has an associate's degree and is in college now\u2014college completion is a positive predictor of lower recidivism. She only held one job recently, which might mean she's looking for something new or maybe struggling with job instability.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use isn't as severe as harder drugs, so that's less concerning. No recent depression could indicate good mental health, which is a positive sign.\n\nLiving situation at a young age was a household of four, so she's had some exposure to family dynamics. Her spirituality\u2014believing in God\u2014is a positive factor; supportive family and religious involvement often help with self-esteem and decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction is the strongest risk indicator here. Age doesn't make her less risky if she has that history. Her education level and living alone are mitigating factors, but the prior arrest is significant enough to consider high risk. Without more serious warning signs like multiple charges or severe drug use (like alcohol or harder drugs), maybe a lower confidence than absolute certainty.\n\nSo I'd lean towards \"YES\" with around 75% confidence because of that one conviction and other mitigating factors, but still significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
