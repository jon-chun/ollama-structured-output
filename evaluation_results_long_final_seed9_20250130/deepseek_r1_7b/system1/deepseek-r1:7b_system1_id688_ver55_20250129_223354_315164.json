    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this risk assessment indicates high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female from White background. Generally, race isn't a direct indicator of risk unless there are systemic issues involved. She has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That alone is significant because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Her height and weight don't directly relate to risk without additional context, so I'm not sure how much this contributes here. Maybe it's just personal information.\n\n living alone: Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk factors like isolation or substance use, but she's also not married. So maybe that doesn't add much unless combined with other factors.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in 2-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this might actually be protective rather than risk-indicating.\n\nShe held one job during the year: Employed individuals are generally less likely to engage in risky behavior or reoffend compared to those who are unemployed.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a significant risk factor, especially if it's linked to other risky behaviors like substance abuse disorders or criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of depression might suggest better mental health, which is protective against recidivism.\n\nYoung household at age: Small households are often associated with more supervision and less risk compared to larger families. She mentions God has something to do with her life, indicating a strong spiritual support system, which can be protective.\n\nPutting this all together: The key factors that stand out are the prior conviction (convicted once), substance use (marijuana in past four years), and living alone. These points suggest she might have higher risk compared to other factors like education or being employed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
