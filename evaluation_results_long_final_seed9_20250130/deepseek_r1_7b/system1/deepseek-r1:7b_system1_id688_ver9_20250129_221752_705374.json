    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female. Age can be a consideration; younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to older ones. But alone, this doesn't seem like a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. One prior offense could indicate some criminal history, but it's not life-threatening. Convictions are serious, so that's a point in the negative direction.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. This makes her above average in height for her age, which might be associated with higher testosterone levels. Higher testosterone can sometimes be linked to risk behaviors like substance use or criminal activity, but not always definitively.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone doesn't inherently pose a high risk unless there are other factors, but it's neutral on its own.\n\nShe has an associate degree and is in college. Education level is important; higher education can correlate with lower recidivism rates, so this might actually be protective rather than risky.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. Unemployment for a significant period can increase risk, but having at least one job shows some stability.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is mentioned, but she hasn't felt depressed recently. This is tricky because substance use without depression isn't necessarily high risk unless it's frequent or severe. Since she only used marijuana and hasn't had recent issues with depression, this might not be a strong indicator.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to potential peer influences, but again, without other factors like substance use, it's neutral.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has religious support and might seek help through that channel, which is positive for risk assessment as it indicates seeking external support.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one prior conviction, living alone, possible association with substance use (but not severe), educational background, and a young age. These don't strongly indicate high risk but also aren't conclusive protective factors. The confidence level should reflect that there's some risk due to the conviction, but other factors mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\nThe reasoning behind this prediction is as follows: While there are several mitigating factors such as education and living alone, which can be protective, the presence of a prior conviction indicates some risk. Additionally, potential substance use (marijuana) without recent severe depression may suggest underlying issues that could lead to higher risk in the future. Therefore, after considering all factors, the overall risk is moderately high with a confidence level of 65%.",
