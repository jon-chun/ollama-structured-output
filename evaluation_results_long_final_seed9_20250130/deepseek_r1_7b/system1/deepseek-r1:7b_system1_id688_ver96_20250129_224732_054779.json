    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to analyze whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female, White, with one arrest and a prior conviction. That's not great but not immediately alarming. Age-wise, being in her early twenties is common, so maybe not too concerning yet.\n\nShe identifies as White, which could be a sensitive issue regarding discrimination or bias, but I'm not sure how that affects risk assessment directly. Maybe it's more about systemic issues than personal risk here.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 1 inch (about 73 inches) is tall for a woman, and she weighs 163 lbs (~74kg). Being tall might relate to certain health risks or maybe even some workplace hazards, but I don't know if that's directly related to recidivism risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can have its challenges, but again, not sure how it ties into risk factors unless there's something about social isolation or dependency.\n\nEducation: associate/junior college degree and currently in a 2-year college. Some education is generally protective against criminal behavior, so this might lower her risk compared to someone without any formal education.\n\nOccupation: held one job during the year. Employment stability can be a positive indicator; having a steady job might reduce recidivism.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use is generally not a strong predictor of severe mental health issues like depression, so maybe this isn't a big risk factor here.\n\nMental health: no depression reported in the past month. That's positive and could indicate better mental health, which might lower risk.\n\nHousehold size at young age: lived with four people when young. A larger household can sometimes correlate with different social dynamics or potential exposure to negative influences, but I'm not sure how significant that is for risk assessment without more context.\n\nReligion: believes God has something to do with her personal fate. Religious beliefs can influence behavior in various ways\u2014might be protective if it leads to community support and good moral values, but could also have negative impacts if there's neglect of responsibilities or risky behaviors related to religion.\n\nPutting this all together: most factors seem neutral or slightly positive towards risk reduction. No major red flags like multiple convictions, severe drug/alcohol use, or significant mental health issues. She's young, so maybe more time for positive development. The only potential concern is the lack of marriage and living alone, but that doesn't directly indicate high risk without additional context on her current situation.\n\nTherefore, I don't see a strong indication of high risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
