    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested once and convicted. That seems like a significant factor because prior convictions are usually linked to higher recidivism rates. But she's only been convicted once, so maybe that's not too bad yet.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 163 lbs. I don't know if height or weight is directly relevant here unless it affects her ability to do something, but in risk assessment, those usually aren't major factors unless there's a medical issue.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Being single can sometimes be linked to higher risk of certain behaviors, but not always. Living alone doesn't necessarily make someone more dangerous on its own.\n\nShe has a associate or junior college education and is currently in a 2-year college. Education level is usually considered a protective factor against recidivism because it can lead to better job opportunities and self-sufficiency. So being still studying might be positive, but her past conviction might outweigh that a bit.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some work experience is good because it suggests she has skills and maybe stability. But having only one job in a year isn't much, so she might have been unemployed or underemployed.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (specifically marijuana). Drug use can be risky. It can lead to unstable behavior, which could increase the risk of further criminal activity or substance abuse issues. Plus, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's interesting because drug use is linked with depression sometimes, but her lack of recent depression might suggest she's managing it okay.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes be associated with higher risk if there are more people who could potentially cause issues or if there was neglect involved. But this depends on other factors like family dynamics and support systems, which aren't provided here.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal events. This is a positive factor because religious affiliation often correlates with better self-discipline and lower risk behavior compared to those who don't affiliate with religion or have atheistic views.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior conviction is a red flag, but the education level, single living situation, job experience, and lack of recent depression are positive signs. However, her drug use in the past four years could be a significant risk factor. Since she's only been convicted once, maybe the risk isn't extremely high, but it's still something to consider.\n\nSo I'm leaning towards a low confidence level because of the potential risks associated with drug use and prior conviction, even though other factors are favorable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 52\n}\n```",
