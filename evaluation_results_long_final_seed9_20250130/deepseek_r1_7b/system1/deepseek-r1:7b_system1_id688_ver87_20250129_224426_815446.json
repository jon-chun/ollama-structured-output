    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's a 21-year-old White female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that might contribute to a higher risk.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is unless it relates to substance use or health issues, which I don't see here.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can be isolating, but without other factors like mental health issues, it might not be as significant on its own.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently in 2-year college. Education level isn't directly tied to risk unless she's struggling or has low motivation, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe held one job during the year. A single job usually means stable income, so maybe not a high risk factor on its own.\n\nDrug use past four years only includes marijuana, and she hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be related to mental health issues like depression or anxiety, but since she's not feeling depressed now, that might mitigate some of the risks associated with drug use.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Household size doesn't directly indicate risk unless it relates to social support, which isn't shown here.\n\nLastly, she believes God has something to do with her personal events. That's a strong indication of religious involvement and belief, which usually correlates with lower risk as people are more likely to seek help if needed.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior conviction is a significant factor, but the other factors don't necessarily point towards high risk unless there's an underlying issue like drug use linked to mental health. Without further information on mental health or substance abuse beyond the stated factors, maybe she's at moderate risk.\n</think>\n\nThe key risk here is the single prior conviction. The other factors, such as living alone and being White, don't necessarily indicate a high risk unless there are underlying issues like drug use linked to mental health not explicitly mentioned. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
