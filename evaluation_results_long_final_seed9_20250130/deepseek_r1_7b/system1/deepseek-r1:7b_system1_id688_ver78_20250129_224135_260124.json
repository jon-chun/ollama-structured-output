    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female. Let's go through each one and see how they contribute to the risk.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s a red flag because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. So that should increase the risk.\n\nShe identifies as White, which doesn't directly indicate high risk but can be a factor in certain studies. However, without other info, I'll note it as neutral for now.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. No information on BMI or whether this affects risk. Probably not relevant here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because having a support network might reduce risk, but without knowing her circumstances, it's hard to say. Maybe neutral.\n\nEducation level: associate or junior college completed and currently in 2-year college. College education is generally protective against recidivism, so that should lower the risk.\n\nShe held only one job last year. Employment stability can affect reintegration into society after incarceration, which might influence risk. Not sure how much it impacts risk assessment though.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can increase risk if it's recent or frequent, but here it's just marijuana and not severe symptoms like depression in the last month. So maybe a slight negative but not strong.\n\nHousehold size was 4 at a young age. Younger siblings might offer support, so that could be protective.\n\nReligion: she believes God is involved. Religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower risk due to community support and values, though it's not always the case.\n\nPutting this all together, the prior arrest is a significant risk factor (YES). Other factors like living alone don't tip it over enough. So my confidence is 70% because one clear risk stands out, but other factors could mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
