    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment query step by step. The user provided several risk factors for a 21-year-old female and wants me to determine if they indicate a high risk, responding only with a JSON object.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the factors:\n\n- Age: 21 years old\n- Race: White\n- Arrests: 1 time, convicted once\n- Physical characteristics: 6'1\" tall, 163 lbs. No immediate red flags here.\n- Marital status: Never married\n- Living situation: Alone\n- Education: Associate/Junior College completed, currently in a 2-year college\n- Employment: Held one job during the year\n- Drug use: Used marijuana in past four years\n- Depression: Not felt in the past month\n- Family background: At young age lived with household of 4\n- Religious belief: Believes God has influence over her life\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each factor's potential impact on risk. Let's consider each one:\n\n1. **Age and Race**: Generally, younger individuals might be at slightly lower risk compared to adults, but race isn't typically a direct indicator of risk unless there's evidence of systemic inequalities, which isn't provided here.\n\n2. **Arrests and Convictions**: One arrest is notable. Reconviction history would add more weight, but one conviction can sometimes indicate prior legal issues that might signal future behavior patterns.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes**: No red flags in terms of size; she's 6'1\" which is above average, not necessarily high risk based on height alone.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Alone**: Being single isn't inherently high risk, but living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there are no support networks.\n\n5. **Education Level**: She has some college education, which might indicate responsible behavior compared to those without education, but not necessarily a strong indicator of risk on its own.\n\n6. **Employment**: Employed one job in the past year; having employment can be positive as it shows stability and income potential.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: marijuana use is generally less severe than other drug uses (like alcohol or harder drugs), so this might not contribute significantly to high risk unless there are patterns of substance abuse.\n\n8. **Depression**: She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which suggests she's managing her mental health well and may have better coping skills.\n\n9. **Family Background**: Growing up with four family members could offer support but doesn't necessarily mitigate risk if issues like neglect or abuse are present, which aren't indicated here.\n\n10. **Religious Belief**: Believing in God might provide a sense of purpose or guidance, reducing behavioral unpredictability compared to those without such beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- The one prior arrest is the most significant factor. Reconviction history can be a strong indicator of potential future criminal behavior.\n- Her education and employment indicate she's stable and likely to maintain that stability unless there are underlying issues not mentioned.\n- She hasn't shown signs of substance abuse beyond marijuana, which might correlate with higher risk if she were to escalate.\n- No evidence of high depression levels suggests good mental health.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of a prior arrest leans towards moderate risk. Without more concerning factors like multiple arrests, substance abuse issues (beyond marijuana), or indicators of instability, her overall risk isn't extremely high but is on the higher side compared to someone without any prior convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
