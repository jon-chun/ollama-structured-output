    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and think about how they might contribute to risk.\n\nFirst, she's White. I know that race can be a factor in recidivism rates, but it's not the only consideration. There are other variables like socioeconomic status, education, and personal circumstances that also play a role. So while being White isn't inherently high risk, it doesn't immediately point towards high risk either.\n\nShe has one prior arrest and one conviction. One prior offense might increase her risk slightly because of potential substance use or unstable living situations she might have had before. But since this is only one offense, the impact might be moderate rather than high.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 163 lbs. She's currently living alone. At 21, she's probably in college, so maybe she has a stable income. Living alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless there are other factors like homelessness or unstable housing, which I don't see here.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is single. Single status can be associated with higher recidivism rates because there might not be support networks, but again, that depends on other factors like substance use or lack of education.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level usually correlates with lower risk since higher education often leads to better job opportunities and stable lives. So this is a protective factor, not contributing to high risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having a job can help with financial stability and support, so it's another positive indicator for low risk.\n\nDrug use in past four years: she has marijuana use but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't necessarily a bad sign if she's been clean or managing it without severe issues. However, drug use can sometimes be linked to other risky behaviors or unstable situations.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of depression is generally a good sign as it indicates mental health stability, which reduces risk factors.\n\nYoung age: 21 is considered relatively young, but that's more about life stage than an indicator of high risk unless she has other negative factors like substance use or unstable living conditions at this stage.\n\nPast household size was 4 when young. That might indicate living with family, which could be protective if they provided support and stability. However, it doesn't necessarily mean she's in a supportive environment now.\n\nBelieves God is involved in her life: This indicates a strong religious foundation or spiritual involvement, which can contribute to personal stability and reduce risk factors related to substance use or other unstable behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some potential risk points like drug use and living alone (though she's in college), the positive factors like education, stable job, and spiritual involvement outweigh them. The presence of a prior arrest is a concern but not extremely high given her current positive traits and age.\n\nTherefore, I would lean towards a low to moderate prediction of high risk, maybe around 25% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
