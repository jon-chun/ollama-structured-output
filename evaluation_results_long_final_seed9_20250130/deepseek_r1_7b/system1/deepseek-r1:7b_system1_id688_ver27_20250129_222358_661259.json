    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual based on her profile. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female. Being young might actually be protective rather than a risk factor, but age can sometimes play a role in certain behaviors.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's significant because prior convictions are usually strong predictors of recidivism. So that already points towards a high risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't see an immediate issue with her physical build, but weight can sometimes be associated with substance abuse or health issues, which might indirectly relate to drug use history.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living independently at a young age could indicate self-reliance, but it doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless combined with other factors like substance use or unstable relationships.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college degree and is currently in a 2-year program. Education can sometimes be protective if she's using it to gain better opportunities, but if she's involved in risky behaviors despite her education, that could change things.\n\nShe's employed one job during the year. Employment generally reduces risk because it provides stability, so this might actually lower the risk.\n\nHer drug use history: she used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to various issues but if she's not experiencing severe mental health symptoms, maybe her motivation for using is less concerning than someone with a history of depression or substance abuse.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. Larger households can sometimes mean more exposure to risk factors like domestic violence or substance abuse from others, which could influence her behavior now.\n\nHer religious belief that God plays a role in her life adds a layer of personal motivation for positive behavior, which might counteract some negative tendencies.\n\nPutting it all together: the most significant factor is the prior conviction. That's one arrest and a conviction, which can strongly indicate past behavior that may lead to future issues. Her age being 21 suggests she's just starting out, but her education and current studies might be used for better opportunities, which could mitigate risk if she's focused on positive outcomes.\n\nHowever, the prior criminal history is a red flag regardless of other factors. So while some points like living alone or having a job are protective, the presence of a conviction brings up high risk considerations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\nThe prediction is based on the significant factor of prior criminal history (1 arrest and conviction). Other factors like age, education, employment, and living situation provide some protective aspects but are outweighed by the existing risk. The confidence level reflects a moderate to high risk assessment due to the presence of a criminal history despite other mitigating factors.",
