    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nShe's White, which might not be directly related unless there are specific stereotypes involved. She has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction, but since it's her first offense, that could be mitigated. Her height and weight don't seem relevant here. She's never married and living alone\u2014single status can affect risk factors because sometimes substance abuse is more common among single individuals.\n\nShe has an associate degree from junior college and is in a 2-year program now. Educational level usually correlates with lower recidivism, so that might be protective. Having one job during the year suggests she's employed but not necessarily stable or involved in risky activities.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana use in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse is a risk factor, especially if there are underlying issues like depression. However, since she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, that might indicate she's managed it well and isn't currently experiencing it as an issue.\n\nLiving with her household of four at a young age could mean she has support from family, which might reduce risk factors related to isolation or stress.\n\nShe mentions believing in God's role in her life. Religious belief can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates due to moral values guiding behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: She has one prior arrest but no history of violence beyond her current charges. Her drug use is recent and she hasn't experienced depression recently, which might suggest she's managed those issues. However, being a young mother could be a risk factor if she's not taking care of herself properly. She's single, which might put her at higher risk for substance abuse or domestic violence scenarios.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the risk is moderate but not extremely high. Her educational background and stable living situation are positive indicators that mitigate some risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
