    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment for a 21-year-old female who's been arrested once and convicted. She's White, 6'1\" tall, weighs 163 lbs, living alone, not married. Her education is up to associate college, she's currently in a 2-year program. She worked one job recently, used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed in a month. She grew up in a household of four and believes in God.\n\nFirst, her prior criminal history\u2014just one arrest doesn't sound too bad, but it's something to consider. Being White might have some societal connotations related to crime rates, but without more context about systemic issues or discrimination, I can\u2019t assume that's the case here.\n\nHer height and weight don't directly relate to risk unless there's a health concern, which isn't indicated here. Living alone could mean she has good support networks, so maybe lower risk in terms of having someone to help her through tough times.\n\nEducation-wise, she\u2019s completed associate and is pursuing another degree. College education is generally protective against reoffending, so that's positive. She only held one job recently; joblessness can lead to stress and increased risk factors.\n\nShe uses marijuana occasionally but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use isn't a direct indicator of high risk unless there were other issues like substance abuse disorders or if it led to problems.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four\u2014small households often provide more support, so that might be protective rather than a risk factor.\n\nBelieving in God could indicate a higher level of spirituality, which is usually associated with lower recidivism rates. People who are religious tend to have stronger family and community support systems.\n\nPutting this all together: one arrest, living alone, college education, job experience, manageable drug use, supportive household, and spiritual beliefs. These factors lean towards lower risk. So I wouldn't predict a high risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
