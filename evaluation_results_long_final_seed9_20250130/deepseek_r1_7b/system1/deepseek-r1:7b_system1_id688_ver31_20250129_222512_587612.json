    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. That's not inherently a red flag, but it might be relevant in terms of systemic issues or community perceptions, though I don't have enough information on that yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single prior conviction can indicate some level of criminal history, which might suggest past behavior that could impact future risk. However, one arrest isn't necessarily a high risk factor unless it's linked to more serious offenses or recidivism patterns.\n\nShe is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. That's tall and on the heavier side, but I don't see how height alone affects risk assessment without knowing her weight relative to others in her context.\n\nLiving alone suggests she doesn't have immediate family support, which can be a risk factor because isolation might lead to substance use or other risky behaviors. But that also depends on her living situation and personal circumstances.\n\nShe has completed an associate/junior college degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level typically correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this could actually indicate she's making positive choices, reducing risk factors.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment can contribute to financial stability and provide substance for support, which might mitigate some risks, but it also depends on the nature of the job.\n\n drug use in the past four years (marijuana only) \u2013 even if she uses marijuana recreationally, it's different fromabuse or substance abuse that could lead to more serious issues. Her statement about not feeling depressed over the past month might indicate she's managing her mental health, which is a positive sign.\n\nShe lived in a household of size four at a young age. Larger families can sometimes offer more support and stability, but it also depends on how that environment impacted her as an individual.\n\nBelieving in God could be a significant factor if she has a strong spiritual support system. Religion often provides coping mechanisms for stress or mental health issues, which might help reduce risk factors compared to those without such support.\n\nPutting this all together: One prior conviction isn't high risk on its own. Her living situation and lack of family support might increase some risks, but her education, job, and positive drug use (marijuana) suggest she's proactive. She's managing her mental health well, which is a strong indicator. The larger household at 17 could be more stabilizing than it seems. Overall, the factors don't strongly indicate high risk; they point towards moderate to low risk.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis of each risk factor shows that while there are some potential red flags like living alone and prior arrest, several mitigating factors exist such as education, employment, positive drug use, and family support which suggest a lower risk. The individual's proactive approach to education, job, and mental health management further reduces the likelihood of high risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
