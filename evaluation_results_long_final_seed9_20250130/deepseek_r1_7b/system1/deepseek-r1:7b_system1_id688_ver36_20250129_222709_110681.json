    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White. I don't see any inherent racial disparities in recidivism data, so that might not be a significant factor here. Next, her age is 21, which is relatively young, and usually lower age groups have higher recidivism rates, but since she has already been convicted once before, maybe that mitigates some of the usual concerns.\n\nShe's been arrested once and has a prior conviction. Recidivism studies show that prior convictions significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending. So this is a strong indicator pointing towards high risk.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, which isn't particularly concerning unless there's a history of violence or something else, but nothing here suggests she's dangerous.\n\nShe weighs 163 lbs. Body weight alone doesn't indicate risk without additional context like substance use or health issues.\n\nNever married and living alone aren't directly related to recidivism, though living with family can sometimes offer support which might reduce risk.\n\nHer education level is an associate/junior college degree followed by a 2-year college enrollment. Higher education has been shown to correlate with lower recidivism rates because of better job opportunities and skills that may help in finding stable employment post-release.\n\nShe held only one job during the year, which could be a double-edged sword. A recent job might mean she's actively seeking to reintegrate into society, but if there are issues like unstable employment or substance use, it could increase risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Marijuana use isn't a direct indicator of recidivism related to drug crimes unless there were any incidents, which aren't mentioned here. Her lack of recent depression might suggest she's managing her personal issues well, but it's not directly tied to risk factors.\n\nShe was living in a household of four at a young age. This could indicate family support, which might help reduce recidivism risk compared to living alone or with fewer family members. However, family dynamics can vary widely, so this isn't conclusive.\n\nHer belief in God: Religious affiliation doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's evidence suggesting that religious factors lead to better or worse outcomes, but without specific data, it's hard to assess.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior conviction is a major red flag. Her age being young might temper some of the usual risks associated with criminal history, but since she has already been convicted once, and considering other factors like education level and job stability, her risk might still be moderate. However, given that she's White, which doesn't have a direct impact here, but prior convictions are a strong indicator.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high confidence score because of the prior conviction despite some mitigating factors like age and education. So I'd say the prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
