    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female from White background. Age might not be directly related unless there's a known vulnerability at that age, but she's already been convicted once, so maybe her history matters more.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor for various behaviors like theft or violence, though it alone doesn't always indicate high risk without other factors.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive but not directly related to current risk unless there's a history of mental issues that might now be changing.\n\nShe lives alone and has no children. Living alone can sometimes lead to more isolation, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors if she's feeling neglected or frustrated.\n\nShe completed an associate degree and is currently in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower risk as it often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. Plus, she's only been holding one job for a year, which isn't too concerning on its own unless the sector is high-risk.\n\nHer belief in God might indicate her level of support from religious communities, which can sometimes provide guidance but doesn't directly correlate with risk without more info about her personal situation or surrounding environment.\n\nCombining these factors: she has a criminal history (1 conviction), uses marijuana, lives alone, and hasn't felt depressed recently. These points are somewhat concerning as they could indicate potential for higher risk behaviors like substance abuse, isolation leading to risky decisions, etc.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nThe person has a criminal history (1 conviction), which is a significant risk factor. The use of marijuana and living alone could contribute to isolation or substance-related risks. While other factors like lack of depression in the past month might indicate stability, the overall profile leans towards high risk due to the mentioned factors.\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
