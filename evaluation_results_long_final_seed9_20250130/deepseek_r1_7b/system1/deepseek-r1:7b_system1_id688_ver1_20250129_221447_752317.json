    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they might contribute.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age-wise, 21 isn't old yet, but maybe her age could be a factor depending on the context. She has one arrest and a conviction, which is just once, so that's not too bad compared to multiple offenses.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't know if weight or height have any bearing here, but maybe her being single could relate to living situation, which isn't directly a risk factor but could be considered in other contexts.\n\nShe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk, unless there are other factors like isolation issues. She has a associate/junior college degree and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education seems okay; maybe not a red flag.\n\nShe held one job during the year. That's manageable for someone her age. She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Drug use isn't always linked to high risk, especially if she's not experiencing severe mental health issues.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has a strong religious foundation, which is generally associated with stability and lower risk of delinquency or other negative behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, there are no major red flags here. She has one prior conviction but hasn't had multiple offenses. Her living situation isn't problematic. Education-wise, she's continuing her studies, so that's positive. No severe drug use issues, and a positive outlook on life with religious belief. \n\nSo overall, I don't see any significant risk factors here. She seems to be in a stable position without any major warning signs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
