    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female from White background. That's typically under 25 and well-spoken, which might be associated with lower risk. She has one arrest and a prior conviction, but only once. So that's not a lot of history there. She's tall at 6'1\" and weighs 163 lbs, which seems healthy, so no issues there.\n\nShe's living alone, which is common among young people, especially first-time college students. She hasn't been married yet, which again points towards being in her early twenties. Her education level is an associate or junior college degree, followed by a 2-year college enrollment. That suggests she has some formal education but maybe not highly specialized skills.\n\nShe's employed one job during the year; that's manageable and shows she can handle basic responsibilities. Drug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. So no current substance abuse issues, which is positive.\n\nOriginally from a household of four at a young age might indicate living with family support, so maybe less stress or environment contributing to issues. Her religious belief that God has something to do with her personal life could provide some guidance and structure.\n\nPutting it all together: low criminal history, health indicators (height/weight), young age with education, stable living situation, no recent substance abuse, positive mental state. These factors point towards low risk.\n</think>\n\nThe individual is 21 years old, which typically indicates a younger, generally healthier profile. Her arrest and conviction history are limited to one prior offense, suggesting no extensive criminal background that might correlate with higher risk. Height and weight fall within typical ranges for her age group, indicating physical health without notable issues.\n\nShe lives alone but at a young age in a household of four, which may suggest family support or a stable living environment. Her educational attainment includes an associate degree and current college enrollment, suggesting ongoing education without significant academic concerns. Employment history shows she has worked one job during the year, which is manageable and indicates responsibility towards personal obligations.\n\nNo recent substance abuse (marijuana use in past four years) and no depressed feelings over the past month suggest mental health stability. Her religious belief may provide a sense of guidance or structure contributing to overall well-being.\n\nConsidering all factors: low criminal history, stable demographics, physical health, education level, employment, and positive mental state collectively indicate LOW RISK with moderate confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
