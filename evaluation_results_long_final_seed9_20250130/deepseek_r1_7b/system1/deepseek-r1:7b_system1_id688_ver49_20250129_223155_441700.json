    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old White female who was arrested once and convicted. That seems like a past offense, which could be significant. However, since it's only one arrest and it's been resolved, maybe the recidivism isn't too high yet.\n\nShe is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. I'm not sure how height and weight contribute to risk assessment here unless there's a specific reason like previous substance abuse or something else related to her size, but nothing stands out immediately.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of potential issues, maybe isolation leading to higher risk of self-harm or substance use, but I'm not certain how significant this factor is on its own.\n\nShe has a high school education and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment can influence her stability; lower education might correlate with higher risk if she's struggling academically, but since she's already attending college, that might indicate some motivation or support.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having at least some work experience could suggest financial independence and responsibility, which are positive indicators for low risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a bit tricky because she's not currently using drugs, so maybe she's aware of the risks or doesn't feel the need to. However, past use could still be concerning if it led to other issues like substance abuse disorders.\n\nHer mental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but considering she used marijuana in the past four years, there might be underlying mental health issues that aren't being addressed. Sometimes substance use can mask mental health problems or make them worse.\n\nLiving situation at a young age: She lived with four people when young, which could indicate family support initially but might also suggest some instability later on if things changed.\n\nHer religious beliefs: She believes in God's influence over her life. Religious factors often correlate with higher risk because of the stressors or emotional strain that can come from religious practices, especially if there are unresolved issues or conflicts within her faith.\n\nPutting it all together, despite not having a lot of past negative factors like multiple convictions or significant substance abuse beyond marijuana use, her religious beliefs and potential underlying mental health issues could contribute to higher risk. She's in college, which is positive, but the combination of living alone at 21 without a spouse might indicate some vulnerability.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of her past use of marijuana and her religious beliefs, even though she has an associate degree. The recidivism rate for someone with only one prior conviction isn't usually that high unless there are other risk factors present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nThis prediction is based on the potential for underlying mental health issues and possible increased risk from religious beliefs, despite having a higher education level. The factors considered suggest a moderate to high risk assessment.",
