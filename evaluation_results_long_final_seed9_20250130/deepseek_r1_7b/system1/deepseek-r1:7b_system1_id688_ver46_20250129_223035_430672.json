    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm faced with this query where someone wants me to act as a risk assessment expert. They've given specific risk factors and want a JSON response indicating whether these factors indicate a high risk. \n\nFirst, let me parse the information provided. The person is a 21-year-old White female. She's been arrested once and convicted. Age-wise, being 21 might not be a big concern unless she has other factors like a criminal history.\n\nShe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 163 lbs. Hmm, that gives me an idea about her physical build but doesn't directly relate to risk without context on health or behavior.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. That could be a red flag for certain risks like isolation leading to substance abuse or mental health issues. But she has completed an associate degree and is in college, which might indicate she's motivated towards betterment. \n\nShe held one job last year, which suggests some work experience but maybe not consistent income sources if she faces setbacks.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That's interesting because frequent drug use can sometimes correlate with depression, but her recent lack of depression might suggest otherwise or she could be using to cope.\n\nShe was in a household of four at a young age. Maybe that environment influenced her behavior; perhaps more supervision led to different choices later on.\n\nShe considers God to have some influence on her life. This could relate to her spiritual support system, which is generally protective against certain risks but might also indicate other factors if she's dealing with issues like isolation or mental health.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a criminal history (1 arrest), which is concerning. Her living situation and age make me think about potential vulnerability, especially if it relates to mental health or substance use. However, her education level suggests she's proactive in her learning, which might mitigate some risks.\n\nI need to assess the confidence level. Given that she has a criminal history, that's a strong indicator of high risk. Other factors like living alone and being 21 don't immediately jump out as high risk without more context. So I'll give her an 85% confidence level because while there are some mitigating factors, the arrest is significant enough to indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
