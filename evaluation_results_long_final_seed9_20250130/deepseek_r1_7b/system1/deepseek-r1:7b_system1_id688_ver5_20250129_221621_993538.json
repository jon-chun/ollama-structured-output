    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female. She identifies as White and has one arrest with a conviction. That seems like a minor offense history, but convictions can be significant depending on the crime type. Since it's just one, maybe not too high risk yet.\n\nShe's 6'1\" tall and weighs 163 lbs. I don't think height or weight alone indicate much unless there are other factors related to that. Her BMI could be calculated, but since she's in college, maybe she has a healthy weight? Not sure how relevant this is for risk assessment.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Being single might correlate with higher risk of substance abuse or isolation issues. She's in college now though, so maybe she's proactive about her education which could mitigate some risks.\n\nShe completed an associate or junior college degree and is currently at a 2-year college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because people are more likely to get job training or support services. So this might not be a high risk factor.\n\nShe held only one job in the past year. That's quite low, which could indicate she's experiencing difficulties finding stable employment. Unemployment can lead to increased substance use and other risky behaviors. This seems like a red flag for high risk.\n\nHer drug use history is marijuana in the past four years. Even if it's marijuana, it's still a substance abuse issue. The duration matters too; if it was recent or frequent, that could be more concerning. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might suggest she's managing her mental health okay, but substance use can exacerbate depression.\n\nShe lived in a household of four when young. A larger household might have had different support structures for her compared to living alone now. It could mean she had some form of support then, which isn't directly related to her current risk factors but might indicate past stability.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. This is a strong indication of her spiritual support system. People who rely on their faith often have better mental health outcomes, so this should lower the risk assessment.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, living alone (could be due to substance use), only one job, and drug use history. These factors might suggest she has some underlying issues that could lead to more risky behavior in the future. The presence of a conviction but no other serious crimes suggests she's not a major risk yet.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because of her recent drug use and joblessness, despite having only one arrest and a college background.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
