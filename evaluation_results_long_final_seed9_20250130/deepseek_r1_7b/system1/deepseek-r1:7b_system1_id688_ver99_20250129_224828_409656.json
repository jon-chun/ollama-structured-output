    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White and 21 years old. I'm not sure how race affects risk assessment in this context, but generally, it can vary based on systemic issues or personal choices. She has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That seems significant because past convictions are a clear indicator of potential reoffending.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't see an immediate risk factor here unless there's something about her weight relative to her frame, but without more context on BMI or health issues, it might not be directly relevant.\n\nShe's living alone, never married, which could mean she's an only child or in a single situation. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk of substance abuse or isolation, but again, that needs more context about her mental health indicators.\n\nShe has a associate/junior college education and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level can be a double-edged sword; while higher education might reduce recidivism, it's not always the case. Being still enrolled could indicate she's motivated to change her situation.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Single job experience isn't inherently bad, but if that job was stable or if she's been unemployed for long periods, that could be a risk factor. However, since she's in college, maybe she has plans for employment soon.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to various issues, but without knowing the type of drug or frequency, it's hard to assess severity. Not feeling depressed could mitigate some risks associated with substance abuse.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. Larger households might have different dynamics that could either protect or expose her to certain influences. Without more info on family structure now, this might not be directly relevant.\n\nHer belief in God: This is an existential risk factor; religious beliefs can influence behavior and decision-making. However, without knowing how that affects her specific behavior regarding risky activities, it's hard to gauge.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors here are the criminal history (1 arrest), living alone with no marriage, past drug use, and current enrollment in college. The arrest is a strong indicator of potential high risk. The other factors don't necessarily add significant risk unless combined with more concerning aspects like substance abuse or unstable living conditions.\n\nSo, I would lean towards high risk but not extremely so since the primary issues are her previous conviction and single status. Her education might indicate she's proactive about changing her situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
