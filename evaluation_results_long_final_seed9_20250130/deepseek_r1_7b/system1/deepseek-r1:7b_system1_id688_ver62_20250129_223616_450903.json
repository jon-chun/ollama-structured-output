    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they might contribute to her risk level.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White descent. I don't know if race plays a significant role here, but sometimes certain demographics can have higher recidivism rates for various reasons. However, without more data on systemic issues or specific experiences related to her race, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which does indicate some criminal history. People with a conviction are often considered at higher risk because they've violated the law before, which can impact their future behavior.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 1 inch, and she weighs 163 lbs. I don't immediately see how these physical characteristics contribute to risk unless there's something about her body type that could affect her ability or willingness to engage in certain activities. But from the given information, it doesn't seem relevant.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because having a partner might provide emotional support or reduce stress. However, it also depends on other factors like how she's handling her situation economically and socially.\n\nShe has completed an associate/junior college degree and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism rates. Completing some college can show maturity and responsibility, which might reduce the risk of reoffending.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment stability can be a positive factor because having income sources usually reduces the motivation to commit crimes. But if she's unemployed or underemployed, that could be a red flag.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, which is less severe than other drugs like cocaine or heroin, might not have significant negative effects unless there are underlying issues like depression. Since she hasn't felt depressed lately, it's possible that she's managing her substance use without affecting her mental health negatively.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 4 at a young age. The size of the family can influence how she was raised and the level of support or neglect she experienced. However, without knowing if there were any issues with that household, it's hard to assess its impact on her current risk level.\n\nFinally, she believes in God. Religious affiliation often correlates with better self-discipline and higher moral values, which might reduce recidivism risk. However, personal beliefs can vary widely, and sometimes religious individuals might engage in riskier behaviors if their faith doesn't provide a strong moral compass.\n\nPutting all these together: one prior arrest is concerning but not life-threatening. Her education level is positive. Employment suggests she's capable of supporting herself. She hasn't experienced recent mental health issues or drug use that correlates with risk. However, living alone without a partner could mean less emotional support and might increase stress. Her belief in God is a protective factor.\n\nI'm leaning towards no high risk because the factors pointing towards lower risk (education, employment) are stronger than those suggesting higher risk. The prior arrest doesn't immediately indicate high risk unless there's evidence of continued problematic behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
