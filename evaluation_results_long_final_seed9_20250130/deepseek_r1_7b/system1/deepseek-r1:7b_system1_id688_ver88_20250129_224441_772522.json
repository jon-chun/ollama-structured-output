    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which isn't inherently a risk factor but can sometimes be associated with systemic issues. She has one arrest and a conviction, so that's one negative point. Her height and weight don't seem directly related to risk unless there's something about her behavior or health from that, but I don't see it here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone isn't necessarily bad, but the lack of marriage might affect things like support networks. She has a associate/junior college degree and is in college, so she's got some education which usually correlates with better job opportunities and lower risk.\n\nShe worked one job during the year. Unemployment for that long could be a risk factor, but since she has work experience, maybe it's less severe. Her drug use is only marijuana in the past four years; no hard drugs mentioned. She hasn't felt depressed in a month, which might indicate some mental health stability.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at an young age. Shared living can sometimes lead to issues like domestic abuse or neglect if not properly supervised, but she's young and it's her first time, so maybe that's mitigated.\n\nHer religious belief is mentioned; people with strong faith often have better coping mechanisms for stress and substance use, which could be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nPutting this all together, there are a couple of negative points like the arrest and single living situation. However, she has some positive factors like education and stable employment. Without more concerning factors, maybe her risk is low but not negligible. I'd lean towards NO with high confidence because most factors don't point to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
