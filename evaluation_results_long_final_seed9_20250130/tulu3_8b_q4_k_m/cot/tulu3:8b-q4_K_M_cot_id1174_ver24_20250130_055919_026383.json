He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
