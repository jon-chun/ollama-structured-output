    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and correlations.\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor based on the analysis.\n3. Apply the weighted risk factors to the new case.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nLet's go through this process:\n\n1. Analyzing the examples:\n   - Gender: Males seem more likely to reoffend than females, but not consistently.\n   - Marital status: Cohabiting males are associated with higher risk in Examples #16 and #25.\n   - Employment history: Holding multiple jobs doesn't seem to strongly correlate with recidivism.\n   - Household size: Larger households don't consistently correlate with higher or lower risk.\n   - Living situation at age 12: Biological parents together seems safer, while other situations have mixed outcomes.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   a) Gender: Male (low), Female (very low)\n   b) Marital status: Never married (medium), Cohabiting male (high)\n   c) Employment history: Unemployed (medium), Multiple jobs (low)\n   d) Household size: Larger households (low to medium)\n   e) Living situation at age 12: Biological parents together (very low), Other situations (low to medium)\n\n3. Applying weighted risk factors to the new case:\n   - Male: Low risk\n   - Never married, cohabiting: Medium to high risk\n   - Held 3 jobs: Low risk\n   - Household size of 4: Low to medium risk\n   - Lived with biological parents at age 12: Very low risk\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that the presence of multiple factors suggests a moderate overall risk. The cohabiting status in a never married male stands out as a potential high-risk factor from our analysis of examples. However, it's balanced by other lower-risk factors.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Based on this analysis, I predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, but with moderate confidence.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter careful consideration and reflection on the analysis, I believe this prediction is reasonable. The cohabiting status of a never married male stands out as a significant risk factor in our examples, even though it's not present in every case. This balances against some lower-risk factors like employment history and living situation at age 12.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"low\", \"While males seem more likely to reoffend than females in the examples, this factor alone doesn't strongly indicate recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Never married, cohabiting male\", \"high\", \"This combination appears to be associated with higher risk of recidivism in our analysis of given examples.\"),\n    (\"Held 3 jobs\", \"low\", \"Multiple job holding doesn't seem to correlate strongly with recidivism in the provided examples.\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"low to medium\", \"Larger households don't consistently show higher or lower risk in the given cases.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological parents at age 12\", \"very low\", \"This seems to be a protective factor based on our analysis of the examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n</output>",
