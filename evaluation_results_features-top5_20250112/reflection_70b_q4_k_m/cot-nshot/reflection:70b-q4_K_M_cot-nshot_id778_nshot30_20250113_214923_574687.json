    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll follow a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and relationships between risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their apparent influence on recidivism.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided at the end of the examples.\n4. Predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this particular case.\n5. Calculate a confidence level for the prediction.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\nLooking at the examples, we can see that gender doesn't seem to be a strong predictor on its own. Marriage status and cohabitation seem to have some influence. Employment history appears significant, with unemployment correlating more frequently with positive recidivism outcomes. Household size seems less relevant overall. The family structure at age 12 also shows some patterns.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\nBased on the analysis:\n- Gender: low\n- Marriage status/cohabitation: medium (more influence when not married or cohabiting)\n- Employment history: high\n- Household size: low\n- Family structure at age 12: medium\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\nFor the case of a female who is divorced, not cohabiting, currently unemployed, with a household size of 4, and lived with her biological mother (marital status unknown) at age 12:\n\n4. Prediction:\nGiven that this individual has several risk factors (divorced, not cohabiting, currently unemployed), I would predict \"YES\" for recidivism.\n\n5. Confidence level:\nBased on the analysis of patterns in the example cases and the specific factors present in this case, I would assign a confidence level of 80%.\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our reasoning:\n- We've considered all the given information.\n- We've analyzed the patterns in the example cases.\n- We've assigned weights to risk factors based on their apparent influence.\n- We've applied these weights to the specific case and made a prediction.\n- Our confidence level reflects the strength of the evidence supporting our prediction.\n\nThe reasoning appears sound, but let's double-check if we missed any important factors or if our weights are reasonable. Upon reflection, it seems that our analysis is comprehensive and consistent with the patterns observed in the examples.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's format the answer as requested:\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Gender doesn't seem to be a strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"marriage status/cohabitation\", \"medium\", \"Being divorced and not cohabiting may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"high\", \"Current unemployment significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Household size doesn't appear to be a strong predictor in this case.\"),\n    (\"family structure at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother (marital status unknown) may contribute to increased risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on the analysis of the given example cases and the specific factors present in this particular case. The high confidence level reflects the strong correlation between unemployment, marital status/cohabitation, and recidivism observed in the examples.\n</output>",
