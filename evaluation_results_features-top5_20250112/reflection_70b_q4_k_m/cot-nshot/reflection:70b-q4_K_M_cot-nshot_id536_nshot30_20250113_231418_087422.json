    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given examples, identify patterns in risk factors related to recidivism outcomes, and then apply this analysis to the specific case provided. Let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples:\n   - Identify common risk factors associated with both positive and negative outcomes\n   - Note any apparent correlations or patterns\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each identified risk factor based on their frequency and impact in the examples\n\n3. Apply this weighted analysis to the specific case provided\n\n4. Make a prediction based on the overall risk assessment\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Analyzing the given examples:\n   - Common factors across most cases: Never married, not cohabiting\n   - Factors associated with positive outcomes (NO recidivism):\n     * Larger number of jobs held\n     * Living with both biological parents at age 12\n     * Smaller household size (2-4)\n   - Factors associated with negative outcomes (YES recidivism):\n     * Current unemployment or fewer job changes\n     * Larger household size (5-6)\n     * Not living with both biological parents at age 12\n\n2. Assigning relative weights to risk factors:\n   - \"Never married, not cohabiting\": Low (present in most cases, doesn't seem significant on its own)\n   - Number of jobs held: Medium (more job changes seem to correlate with lower recidivism)\n   - Living situation at age 12: High (living with both biological parents seems strongly correlated with positive outcomes)\n   - Household size: Medium (larger households may increase recidivism risk)\n\n3. Applying the analysis to the specific case:\n   - Female\n   - Never married, not cohabiting (Low weight)\n   - Held 3 jobs (Medium weight, relatively good)\n   - Living situation at age 12: Both biological parents (High weight, very positive)\n   - Household size: 4 (Medium weight, neutral to slightly negative)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems sound. However, I should consider that this is a female case, while most examples were male. This could potentially affect the outcome, as some studies suggest gender differences in recidivism rates. Let's add this as an additional factor:\n- Gender (female): Medium weight, potentially positive\n</reflection>\n\n4. Making the prediction:\n   - The strong positive factor of living with both biological parents at age 12 outweighs other factors.\n   - The medium-weighted factors (number of jobs and gender) support a positive outcome.\n   - The only potential negative factor is the household size of 4, but it's not strongly indicative of recidivism.\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case will be NO.\n\nConfidence level: 80%\n\n<reflection>\nAfter completing the analysis and prediction, I believe my reasoning is sound. The key factors supporting a positive outcome (no recidivism) are:\n1. Living with both biological parents at age 12, which seems strongly correlated with lower recidivism rates.\n2. Holding multiple jobs, indicating stability or effort towards employment.\n3. Being female, which may have a slightly protective effect against recidivism.\n\nThe only potential negative factor is the household size of 4, but it's not strong enough to outweigh the positive factors. Therefore, I'm confident in my prediction and believe an 80% confidence level is appropriate.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"Low\", \"Present in most cases, doesn't seem significant on its own\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held (3)\", \"Medium\", \"Relatively good indicator of stability or employability\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Both biological parents\", \"High\", \"Strongly correlated with positive outcomes and lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Household size (4)\", \"Medium\", \"Neutral to slightly negative, as larger households may increase risk factors\"),\n    (\"Gender (female)\", \"Medium\", \"Potential protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
