The combination of low to medium-risk factors, particularly the presence of cohabitation and stable employment history, outweighs the high-risk factor related to the living situation at age 12.\n\nThe female gender generally shows lower recidivism rates in criminal justice studies, which contributes positively to this prediction. While the lack of a married relationship could be seen as a risk factor, the fact that she is cohabiting provides stability and reduces isolation, effectively mitigating this risk.\n\nThe stable employment history with two jobs indicates some level of responsibility and ability to maintain employment, despite not being extremely extensive. The moderate household size suggests an environment with potential support systems in place.\n\nHowever, the uncertain family dynamics in childhood (living with biological mother whose marital status was unknown) is considered a high-risk factor for future criminal behavior. This factor could potentially contribute to increased stress or instability in the individual's life.\n\nDespite this higher risk factor, the overall balance of factors and the presence of stabilizing elements lead to a prediction of \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, with an 80% confidence level. The prediction suggests that while there are some risk factors present, they do not outweigh the more positive indicators in this case.\n</output>",
