    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nLet's approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and relationships between risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact on the outcome.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the given case.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the examples\n\nLooking at the examples, we can observe some patterns:\n- Employment status seems to have an impact (unemployed vs. employed)\n- Household size appears to be relevant\n- Living situation at age 12 may influence outcomes\n- Gender doesn't seem to be a strong factor in these examples\n- Cohabitation status is mostly irrelevant\n\nStep 2: Assign relative weights to risk factors\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n1. Employment status (currently unemployed vs. having held jobs): high\n2. Household size: medium\n3. Living situation at age 12: medium\n4. Gender: low\n5. Cohabitation status: low\n6. Number of jobs held: low-medium\n\nStep 3: Apply these weighted risk factors to the given case\n\nThe person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 4 jobs with a household size of 5 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\n\nRisk factor analysis:\n- Employment status: Has held multiple jobs (positive factor)\n- Household size: Medium (neutral factor)\n- Living situation at age 12: Lived with both biological parents (positive factor)\n- Gender: Female (weak positive or neutral factor based on examples)\n- Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting (weak negative or neutral factor)\n- Number of jobs held: Held multiple jobs (positive factor)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems reasonable. However, I should consider that despite being unemployed currently, having held 4 jobs in the past could be seen as a positive factor rather than a high-risk one.\n</reflection>\n\nRevised analysis:\n1. Employment status (currently unemployed but has held multiple jobs): medium-positive\n2. Household size: medium\n3. Living situation at age 12: low-medium risk\n4. Gender: low\n5. Cohabitation status: low\n6. Number of jobs held: low-medium\n\nStep 4: Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome\n\nBased on this analysis, the overall risk profile seems to be relatively low.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter considering all factors, I believe the prediction should lean towards \"NO\" for recidivism. The positive factors (employment history and stable family background) outweigh the neutral or slightly negative ones (current unemployment and household size).\n</reflection>\n\nFinal prediction: NO\n\nConfidence level: 85%\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Employment status\", \"medium-positive\", \"Currently unemployed but has held multiple jobs in the past, indicating a positive employment history.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium\", \"A household size of 5 is neither particularly large nor small, and doesn't strongly influence the outcome either way.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"low-medium risk\", \"Having lived with both biological parents suggests a relatively stable childhood environment, which could reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Based on the examples provided, gender does not appear to be a significant factor in determining recidivism outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting may have some minor impact but is generally considered a weak factor based on the given examples.\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held\", \"low-medium\", \"Having held 4 jobs indicates employment stability and adaptability, which can be seen as positive factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n</output>",
