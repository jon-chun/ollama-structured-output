This aligns with observations from the example cases, where unemployed individuals were more likely to have positive rearrest recidivism outcomes.\n\nWhile being never married and having a smaller household size are potential risk factors, they don't appear as strongly correlated with recidivism in this dataset. The living situation at age 12 doesn't seem to significantly impact the prediction based on the provided examples.\n\nGiven these considerations, the model predicts a positive rearrest recidivism outcome (YES) for this case, with an 85% confidence level.\n\nThis prediction is based on patterns observed in the example cases and may not reflect real-world outcomes or more complex factors that could influence criminal behavior. The actual likelihood of rearrest could be influenced by additional factors not present in this dataset.\n</output>",
