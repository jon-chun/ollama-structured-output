    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and relationships between risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their apparent impact in the examples.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the new case provided.\n4. Make a prediction of 3-year rearrest recidivism for the new case.\n5. Estimate confidence level based on the strength of evidence and consistency with given examples.\n\nLet's work through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyzing the examples:\n- Employment status seems to have an impact: currently unemployed individuals are more likely to reoffend.\n- Household size doesn't appear to be a strong factor in these examples.\n- Living situation at age 12 has some influence, with those living with both biological parents or other stable arrangements showing lower recidivism rates.\n- Gender and marital status don't seem to have a significant impact based on the given examples.\n- Number of jobs held doesn't appear to be strongly correlated with recidivism.\n\n2. Assigning weights:\na) Employment status: high\nb) Living situation at age 12: medium\nc) Household size: low\nd) Gender: low\ne) Marital status: low\nf) Number of jobs held: low\n\n3. Applying these to the new case:\n- Employment status: The person has held multiple jobs, but is not currently unemployed (neutral).\n- Living situation at age 12: Biological mother and other parent present (favorable).\n- Household size: 3 (neutral).\n- Gender: Male (neutral).\n- Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting (neutral).\n- Number of jobs held: 4 (neutral).\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I should adjust the weight for \"number of jobs held\" to medium. In some examples, individuals with many jobs show lower recidivism rates, which could indicate stability or a willingness to work.\n</reflection>\n\nCorrected weights:\na) Employment status: high\nb) Living situation at age 12: medium\nc) Household size: low\nd) Gender: low\ne) Marital status: low\nf) Number of jobs held: medium\n\n4. Making the prediction:\nBased on the analysis, this individual seems to have more favorable factors than unfavorable ones. They have a stable employment history (4 jobs), lived in a relatively stable household at age 12, and are not currently unemployed.\n\n5. Estimating confidence level:\nGiven that most of our key risk factors point towards lower recidivism, but without any overwhelmingly strong indicators of low risk, I would estimate the confidence level to be around 80%.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter careful consideration, this prediction aligns well with the patterns observed in the given examples and takes into account the weighted risk factors for this particular case. The confidence level is moderate due to the presence of both positive (stable employment history, good living situation at age 12) and neutral factors.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Multiple jobs held; not currently unemployed\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Biological mother and other parent present\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"3, which doesn't seem to have a strong impact in given examples\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Male, but gender doesn't appear significant in examples\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Never married, not cohabiting; marital status doesn't seem impactful in examples\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held\", \"medium\", \"4 jobs, indicating some stability and work ethic\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
