    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll devise a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and correlations.\n2. Determine the risk factors for each case.\n3. Assign weights to each risk factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n4. Apply these weighted risk factors to the new case.\n5. Make a prediction based on the analysis.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n- Unemployment seems to increase risk of rearrest (Examples 6, 8, and 9).\n- Larger household size might be associated with higher recidivism (Examples 6, 7, 10, and 16).\n- Living with both biological parents at age 12 generally shows a lower risk.\n- Cohabiting status seems to increase risk when other factors are present.\n\n2. Identifying risk factors:\n   - Gender\n   - Marital status\n   - Cohabitation status\n   - Employment history\n   - Household size\n   - Living situation at age 12\n\n3. Assigning weights to risk factors:\n   a) Gender: Low (no clear pattern)\n   b) Marital status: Medium (being never married seems neutral)\n   c) Cohabitation status: Medium (cohabiting might increase risk)\n   d) Employment history: High (unemployment is strongly associated with recidivism)\n   e) Household size: Medium (larger households may be associated with higher risk)\n   f) Living situation at age 12: High (living with both biological parents seems protective)\n\n4. Applying these weighted risk factors to the new case:\n   - Gender: Female, Low\n   - Marital status: Never married, Medium (Neutral)\n   - Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting, Medium (Neutral)\n   - Employment history: Held 1 job, High (slightly concerning)\n   - Household size: 4, Medium (neutral)\n   - Living situation at age 12: Both biological parents, High (protective)\n\n5. Making a prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, the most significant factors are:\n   - Employment history (held only 1 job): High risk\n   - Living with both biological parents at age 12: Low risk\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I should also consider that this case doesn't have any of the strongly predictive factors for recidivism from the examples (unemployment, large household size, cohabitation in risky situations). The protective factor of living with both biological parents seems to outweigh the slightly concerning employment history.\n</reflection>\n\nTherefore, my final prediction is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"Low\", \"No clear pattern in recidivism prediction\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"Medium\", \"Being never married seems neutral in this context\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"Medium\", \"Not cohabiting, which doesn't appear to increase risk\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"High\", \"Held only 1 job, slightly concerning but not strongly predictive of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"Medium\", \"Neutral factor in this case\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"High\", \"Protective factor as lived with both biological parents\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\nBased on the analysis of the provided example cases and the weighted risk factor assessment for the given case, here is the prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"Low\", \"No clear pattern in recidivism prediction\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"Medium\", \"Being never married seems neutral in this context\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"Medium\", \"Not cohabiting, which doesn't appear to increase risk\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"High\", \"Held only 1 job, slightly concerning but not strongly predictive of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"Medium\", \"Neutral factor in this case\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"High\", \"Protective factor as lived with both biological parents\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. Gender: No clear pattern emerges from the examples, so it's assigned a low weight.\n\n2. Marital status and cohabitation status: Both are neutral factors in this case.\n\n3. Employment history: Holding only one job is slightly concerning but not strongly predictive of recidivism based on the given examples.\n\n4. Household size: The household size of 4 doesn't seem to be a significant risk factor based on the provided cases.\n\n5. Living situation at age 12: This is a high-weighted protective factor, as living with both biological parents appears to lower the risk of recidivism in most examples.\n\nGiven these factors, while there are some concerns (particularly the limited employment history), the protective nature of having lived with both biological parents and the lack of strongly predictive negative factors lead to a prediction of \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism. The confidence level is set at 80%, reflecting that this case doesn't have any of the strong predictors of recidivism seen in the examples, but also acknowledging that some risk factors are present.\n</output>",
