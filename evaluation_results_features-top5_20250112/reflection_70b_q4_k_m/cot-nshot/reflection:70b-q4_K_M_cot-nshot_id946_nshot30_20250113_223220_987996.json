    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nLet's approach this complex task step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns in risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided for prediction.\n4. Use the weighted risk factors to make a prediction.\n5. Determine the confidence level of the prediction.\n\nStep 1: Analyze examples\nAfter reviewing all 30 examples, I've identified some key patterns:\n- Gender: Females are less likely to recidivate than males (only 3/9 females recidivated).\n- Marital status: Separated individuals seem more likely to recidivate (2/3 separated cases ended in YES).\n- Employment: Unemployment is strongly correlated with higher recidivism rates.\n- Household size: Larger household sizes are associated with higher recidivism rates.\n- Living situation at age 12: Biological parents present at age 12 seems to reduce recidivism risk.\n\nStep 2: Assign relative weights\nBased on the analysis, I'll assign weights:\n\na) Gender (Medium)\nb) Marital status (High)\nc) Employment (High)\nd) Household size (High)\ne) Living situation at age 12 (Low)\n\n<reflection>\nThe weight assignment seems reasonable based on the patterns observed. However, it's important to note that gender should be considered medium rather than low, as while females are less likely to recidivate, it still plays a role in the overall assessment.\n</reflection>\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the specific case\nFor the case we need to predict:\n- Female (Medium risk factor)\n- Separated, not cohabiting (High risk factor)\n- Currently unemployed (High risk factor)\n- Household size of 9 (Very high risk factor)\n- Lived with other adults at age 12 (Low risk factor)\n\nStep 4: Use weighted risk factors for prediction\nGiven the combination of high-risk factors (separated status, unemployment, large household size) and only one low-risk factor (living situation at age 12), it's likely that this case will result in recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, while the overall analysis seems correct, we should consider the cumulative effect of multiple high-risk factors. The presence of several strong risk indicators (separated status, unemployment, and large household size) outweighs the few lower-risk elements. This suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism than initially thought.\n</reflection>\n\nStep 5: Determine confidence level\nGiven the strength of the risk factors present, I would rate this prediction as high-confidence.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter final consideration, the confidence level should be adjusted to reflect the strong correlation between multiple high-risk factors and recidivism. A higher confidence level is justified due to these compelling indicators.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Female\", \"Medium\", \"Females are less likely to recidivate than males, but still pose a moderate risk\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Separated\", \"High\", \"Separated individuals have shown higher recidivism rates in the given examples\"),\n    (\"Employment: Unemployed\", \"High\", \"Unemployment is strongly correlated with higher recidivism rates across all cases\"),\n    (\"Household size: 9\", \"Very High\", \"Larger household sizes, especially as large as 9, are associated with significantly increased risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Other adults\", \"Low\", \"While not ideal, this living situation is less predictive of recidivism than other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n</output>",
