    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns in risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided using these weighted risk factors.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nLet's go through this process:\n\n1. Analyzing the examples:\n   - Unemployment is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates (Examples #6, #8, #9).\n   - Living without both biological parents at age 12 seems to increase risk (Examples #16, #17, #25).\n   - Household size doesn't appear to be a strong predictor.\n   - Gender and marital status alone don't seem to significantly impact recidivism.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   - Employment status: high\n   - Living situation at age 12: medium\n   - Household size: low\n   - Number of jobs held: low\n   - Gender: low\n   - Marital/cohabiting status: low\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting: (low)\n   - Has held 2 jobs: (low)\n   - Household size of 7: (low)\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12: (medium)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, it's important to note that while employment status is a strong indicator, the person in this case has held multiple jobs, which suggests some level of employability. This might reduce the risk compared to unemployed individuals.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, there are no strongly negative indicators (like unemployment). The living situation at age 12 is slightly concerning, but overall, the factors seem balanced towards lower risk.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter considering all factors and their weights, I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence. The presence of multiple job holdings and lack of strong negative factors support this conclusion.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Has held multiple jobs, indicating employability\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother, not both parents present\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Large household of 7, but no clear correlation to recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held\", \"low\", \"Has held 2 jobs, some job stability indicated\"),\n    (\"Gender and marital/cohabiting status\", \"low\", \"No strong correlations observed in examples\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on the analysis of the given examples and the assigned weights to each risk factor. The person's employment history (having held multiple jobs) suggests a lower risk, despite some potentially concerning factors like not living with both biological parents at age 12. However, no strong negative indicators were present in this case.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 70% because while there are reasons to believe the risk of recidivism might be lower for this individual compared to some others in the examples (especially those who were unemployed), there's always a degree of uncertainty in predicting human behavior. The presence of multiple jobs held and lack of strong negative factors supports this moderate confidence level.\n</output>",
