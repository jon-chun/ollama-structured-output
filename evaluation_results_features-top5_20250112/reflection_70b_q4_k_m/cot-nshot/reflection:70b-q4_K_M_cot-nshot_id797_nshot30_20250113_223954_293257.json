    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given examples, identify patterns and correlations between risk factors and outcomes, weight each factor, and then apply this analysis to predict the outcome for the new case. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples:\n   - Identify common factors among cases with \"YES\" and \"NO\" outcomes\n   - Look for any patterns or correlations\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor:\n   - Gender: Low impact, as both males and females appear in both outcomes\n   - Marital status: Medium impact, as married individuals only appeared in one case (NO outcome)\n   - Cohabiting status: Low impact, as cohabiting cases are rare and show mixed outcomes\n   - Employment history: Medium to High impact, as current unemployment is more common in YES outcomes\n   - Household size: Medium impact, as larger households appear more frequently in YES outcomes\n   - Living situation at age 12: Medium impact, as irregular living situations (not both biological parents) are more common in YES outcomes\n\n3. Analyze the new case:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting, currently unemployed\n   - Household size of 6\n   - No information about living situation at age 12\n\n4. Apply weighted risk factors to predict outcome for the new case\n\n5. Calculate confidence level based on strength of evidence and patterns observed\n\nLet's perform this analysis:\n\n1. Patterns in given examples:\n   - Cases with \"YES\" outcomes often have irregular household situations or current unemployment\n   - Larger households (6+) are more common in YES outcomes\n   - Males and females appear equally in both outcomes\n\n2. Risk factor weights:\n   - Gender: Low\n   - Marital status: Medium\n   - Cohabiting status: Low\n   - Employment history: High\n   - Household size: Medium to High\n   - Living situation at age 12: Medium (but not applicable for this case)\n\n3. Analyzing the new case:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting: Low impact factors\n   - Currently unemployed: High risk factor\n   - Household size of 6: Medium to High risk factor\n\n<reflection>\nThe analysis seems correct so far. We've identified patterns and weighted the factors appropriately. Let's proceed with predicting the outcome and confidence level.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Predicting the outcome:\n   Based on the high impact of current unemployment and the medium to high impact of a large household size, we can lean towards a \"YES\" prediction.\n\n5. Confidence level:\n   Given that two significant risk factors are present (unemployment and large household), but some information is missing (living situation at age 12), we should have a moderate to high confidence in our prediction.\n   \n<reflection>\nAfter reflection, the plan seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. We've considered all relevant factors and their impacts. The conclusion of \"YES\" with a moderate to high confidence level appears justified based on our analysis.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (Male)\", \"low\", \"While gender is present in both outcomes, it doesn't seem to have a significant impact on the prediction.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (Never married)\", \"medium\", \"This factor alone might not be decisive, but combined with other factors could contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting status (Not cohabiting)\", \"low\", \"Similar to gender, this factor doesn't appear to have a strong influence on the outcome.\"),\n    (\"Employment history (Currently unemployed)\", \"high\", \"This is a significant risk factor as it appears more frequently in cases with 'YES' outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Household size (6)\", \"medium-high\", \"Larger households are associated with higher recidivism rates, adding to the overall risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on a careful analysis of the given examples and the weighted risk factors for the new case. The presence of two significant risk factors - current unemployment and a large household size of 6 - strongly suggests an increased likelihood of recidivism.\n\nThe confidence level of 75% reflects that while we have strong evidence from the employment history and household size, some information (such as living situation at age 12) is missing. This lack of complete data prevents us from reaching absolute certainty in our prediction.\n</output>",
