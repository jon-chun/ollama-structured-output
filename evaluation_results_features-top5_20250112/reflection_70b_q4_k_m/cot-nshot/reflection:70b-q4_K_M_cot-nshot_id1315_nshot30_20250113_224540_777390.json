Assign relative weights to each risk factor based on the analysis.\n3. Evaluate the specific case using the weighted risk factors.\n4. Make a prediction based on the evaluation.\n5. Determine confidence in the prediction.\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyzing given examples:\n- Gender: No clear pattern, but females seem to have a lower recidivism rate (8/11).\n- Marital status/cohabitation: Being married or cohabiting seems to reduce recidivism risk.\n- Employment history: More jobs held generally correlate with lower recidivism rates.\n- Household size: Larger households don't show a clear correlation with higher recidivism.\n- Living situation at age 12: Living with both biological parents seems protective against recidivism.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights to risk factors:\nBased on the analysis, I'll assign weights as follows:\n\na) Gender (low)\nb) Marital status/cohabitation (medium)\nc) Employment history (high)\nd) Household size (low)\ne) Living situation at age 12 (high)\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\nCase: Male, never married, not cohabiting, held 1 job, household size of 3, lived with biological father and other parent present at age 12.\n\n4. Making a prediction based on evaluation:\nGiven the factors:\n- Gender: Male\n- Marital status/cohabitation: Never married, not cohabiting (medium risk)\n- Employment history: Held only 1 job (high risk)\n- Household size: 3 (neutral)\n- Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological father and other parent present (low to medium risk)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that the case's living situation at age 12 is actually quite positive. This factor should be considered as a low-risk factor rather than medium.\n</reflection>\n\n5. Determining confidence:\nBased on the analysis, I would say the prediction has moderate confidence.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"low\", \"While males have higher overall recidivism rates in some studies, it's not a strong indicator for this specific case.\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"This is generally associated with a higher risk of recidivism compared to being married or cohabiting.\"),\n    (\"Held only 1 job\", \"high\", \"Limited employment history correlates strongly with higher recidivism rates in the given examples.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 3\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation between household size and recidivism risk was observed in the examples.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological father and other parent present at age 12\", \"low\", \"This stable family structure is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n</output>",
