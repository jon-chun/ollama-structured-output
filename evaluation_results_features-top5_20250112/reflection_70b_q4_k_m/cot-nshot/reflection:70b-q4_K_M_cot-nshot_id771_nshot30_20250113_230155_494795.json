    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given examples, identify patterns in risk factors that lead to recidivism, assign weights to each factor for our case, and then make a prediction. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples:\n   - Most cases with \"currently unemployed\" status resulted in rearrest (Examples 6, 8, 9)\n   - Cases with only biological mother at age 12 had higher recidivism rates\n   - Cohabiting individuals showed a higher recidivism rate when they were female or held fewer jobs\n\n2. Identify patterns:\n   - Employment status seems to be a strong indicator (unemployed = high risk, employed = low risk)\n   - Family structure at age 12 might play a role in stability and support\n   - Gender and cohabiting status seem to interact with other factors\n   - Household size doesn't appear to be a significant factor\n\n3. Assign weights for our case:\n   - Male: medium risk (more examples of males, but not significantly higher recidivism)\n   - Never married: low risk (most cases were never married regardless of outcome)\n   - Cohabiting: high risk (only one male cohabiting case in examples resulted in rearrest)\n   - Held 1 job: medium-high risk (some single-job holders had low recidivism, but our other factors are riskier)\n   - Household size of 2: low risk (household size doesn't seem significant in examples)\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12: high risk (this factor often associated with rearrest)\n\n4. Make a prediction:\n   Given the high-risk factors (cohabiting, single job holder, lived with only biological mother at age 12), and considering the low-confidence nature of this analysis based on limited examples, I predict \"YES\" for recidivism but with moderate confidence.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my analysis, I believe it's comprehensive and considers the main patterns in the given examples. However, I should note that:\n1. The dataset is relatively small (30 cases) which may lead to overfitting or missing important generalizable factors.\n2. Some factors like gender and employment status show clear patterns, while others like household size seem less significant but could be important in a larger dataset.\n3. The interaction between cohabiting status and other factors seems complex and might require more data to fully understand.\n\nGiven these limitations, I should keep my confidence level moderate rather than high or very low.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this reflection, I'll adjust the confidence level from 80% to 70%.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male\", \"medium\", \"While there are more male examples, recidivism rates don't seem significantly higher for males.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"low\", \"Most cases were never married regardless of outcome, so this factor doesn't appear to have a significant impact on recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting\", \"high\", \"In the given examples, cohabiting individuals showed a higher recidivism rate, especially when they held fewer jobs or were female.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job\", \"medium-high\", \"Some single-job holders had low recidivism rates, but in our case, it combines with other riskier factors.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 2\", \"low\", \"Household size doesn't appear to be a significant factor for predicting recidivism based on the given examples.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12\", \"high\", \"This family structure often resulted in rearrest among the provided cases.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
