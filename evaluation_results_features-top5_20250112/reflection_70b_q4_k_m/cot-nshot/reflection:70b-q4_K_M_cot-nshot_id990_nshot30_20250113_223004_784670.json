    "raw_message_text": "After careful analysis of the given examples and risk factors, I have assessed the case of a female who is never married, not cohabiting, has held 2 jobs, with a household size of 4, and lived with her biological mother (marital status unknown) at age 12. Based on this information, here is my assessment:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Female cases typically show lower recidivism rates than males, regardless of age\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married individuals may have less stability and support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation Status\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting does not significantly impact the outcome in this case\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"high\", \"Holding 2 jobs indicates a stable employment history, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"low\", \"A household size of 4 is relatively standard and doesn't significantly impact risk\"),\n    (\"Family Structure at Age 12\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother only (marital status unknown) may indicate some family instability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. The female gender typically shows lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n2. While never being married might suggest less stability, this is balanced by her employment history and age (which isn't specified but likely adult given employment).\n3. Holding two jobs indicates a strong work ethic and ability to maintain employment, which are positive factors for reducing recidivism risk.\n4. The household size of 4 is standard and doesn't significantly impact the risk either way.\n5. Living with only her biological mother at age 12 (with unknown marital status) might suggest some family instability in childhood, but this isn't as strong a predictor compared to other factors.\n\nGiven these considerations, the overall prediction leans towards \"NO\" recidivism within 3 years, with a confidence level of 80%. This high confidence is based on the positive indicators such as stable employment history and female gender, which outweigh the neutral or slightly negative factors like marital status and family structure at age 12.\n\nThis assessment takes into account patterns observed in the provided examples, where similar profiles often resulted in no recidivism. However, it's important to note that individual outcomes can vary based on numerous unaccounted factors, hence the confidence level is not set at 100%.\n\n</output>",
