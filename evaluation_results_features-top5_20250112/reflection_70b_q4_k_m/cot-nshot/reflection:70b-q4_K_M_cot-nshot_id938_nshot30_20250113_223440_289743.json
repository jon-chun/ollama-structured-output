    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and trends in risk factors.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their frequency and correlation with outcomes.\n3. Apply the weighted risk factor analysis to the specific case provided.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Estimate confidence level.\n\nLet's go through this process:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n- Employment status: Unemployment seems to be a strong predictor of positive outcomes (NO).\n- Household size: Larger household sizes are more often associated with negative outcomes (YES).\n- Living situation at age 12: Biological mother, marital status unknown is frequently seen in both positive and negative outcomes.\n- Gender: Both males and females have similar distributions of outcomes.\n- Marital/cohabiting status: Cohabitation seems to be a risk factor for positive outcomes.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\nBased on the analysis, here are my assignments:\n\n- Employment status (currently unemployed): high\n- Household size (larger than 4): medium\n- Living situation at age 12 (biological mother, marital status unknown): low\n- Gender: low\n- Marital/cohabiting status (cohabiting): medium\n\n3. Applying to the specific case:\nThe person is a male who is never married, cohabiting and has held 3 jobs with a household size of 4 and lived with their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nThis case has:\n- Employment status: Not currently unemployed (positive factor)\n- Household size: 4 (neutral)\n- Living situation at age 12: Biological mother, marital status unknown (low risk)\n- Gender: Male (low risk)\n- Marital/cohabiting status: Cohabiting (medium risk)\n\n4. Making a prediction:\nBased on the analysis, this case seems to have more positive factors than negative ones. The lack of current unemployment and neutral household size outweigh the medium risk of cohabitation.\n\nPrediction: NO\n\n5. Estimating confidence level:\nGiven the moderate number of cases analyzed and the balance of positive factors in this case, I would estimate a moderate to high confidence level.\n\nConfidence: 80%\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive and aligns with the patterns observed in the example cases. The prediction is based on a balanced consideration of all risk factors. However, it's important to note that real-world predictions may be more complex and require additional information not provided here.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Employment status\", \"low\", \"The person has held multiple jobs, indicating employment history which is a positive factor.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium\", \"A household size of 4 is neutral and doesn't significantly increase or decrease the risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"low\", \"Biological mother, marital status unknown, while present in both outcomes, doesn't strongly predict either way.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Male gender doesn't seem to be a significant factor in this dataset.\"),\n    (\"Marital/cohabiting status\", \"medium\", \"Cohabitation is seen as a risk factor for positive outcomes in this analysis.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on an analysis of the given example cases and the specific factors presented in the new case. The reasoning behind this prediction is as follows:\n\n1. Employment status: The person has held multiple jobs (3), which indicates a history of employment. This factor strongly suggests that the individual is not currently unemployed, which aligns with many positive outcomes in the provided examples.\n\n2. Household size: A household size of 4 is considered neutral based on our analysis. It doesn't significantly increase or decrease the risk compared to other factors.\n\n3. Living situation at age 12: While \"biological mother, marital status unknown\" is present in both positive and negative outcomes, it doesn't strongly predict either way when considering all factors together.\n\n4. Gender: Male gender doesn't seem to be a significant factor in this dataset, as both males and females have similar distributions of outcomes.\n\n5. Marital/cohabiting status: Cohabitation is identified as a risk factor for positive outcomes based on the analysis of example cases. However, it's important to note that this risk may be mitigated by other factors in this specific case.\n\nGiven these considerations, the majority of factors lean towards a \"NO\" prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism. The confidence level is set at 80% because while there are clear positive indicators (employment history), there are also some neutral or potentially risk-increasing factors present (household size, living situation, cohabitation). This balance of factors warrants a high but not absolute confidence in the prediction.\n\n</output>",
