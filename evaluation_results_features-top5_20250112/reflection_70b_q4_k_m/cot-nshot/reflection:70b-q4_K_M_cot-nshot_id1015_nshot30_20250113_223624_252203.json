    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and correlations.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact on recidivism outcomes in the examples.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided using the weighted risk factors.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n- Gender: Both males and females appear, but with different frequencies (more males).\n- Marital status: Mostly never married, not cohabiting.\n- Employment: Varied job history, sometimes currently unemployed.\n- Household size: Ranges from 2 to 6.\n- Living situation at age 12: Biological parents, single parent, or other adults.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\nBased on the examples, we can observe some patterns:\n\na) Gender: Low risk factor (both genders are present in both outcomes)\nb) Marital status: Medium risk factor (mostly never married, not cohabiting)\nc) Employment history: Medium to High risk factor (more jobs seem to correlate with lower recidivism rates)\nd) Household size: Medium risk factor (varies across examples)\ne) Living situation at age 12: Low to Medium risk factor (biological parents vs. single parent)\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\n- Gender: Male, low risk\n- Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting, medium risk\n- Employment history: Held 3 jobs, medium to high protective factor\n- Household size: 2, potentially lower risk (smaller household)\n- Living situation at age 12: Biological mother, marital status unknown, low to medium risk\n\n4. Making a prediction:\nBased on the analysis, this case seems to have more protective factors than risk factors. The employment history of holding 3 jobs is particularly positive, as it suggests stability and potentially better life skills.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my analysis, I believe I've correctly identified the key factors and their relative weights based on the examples provided. However, I should consider that this case has a smaller household size (2) compared to many of the examples, which could be a positive factor not strongly represented in the given cases.\n</reflection>\n\nGiven this reflection, I'll adjust my confidence level slightly lower due to the limited data on small households.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Male gender is present across both recidivism outcomes\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Most examples are never married, not cohabiting, but doesn't strongly correlate with outcome\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"high\", \"Holding 3 jobs suggests stability and positive life skills\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Small household of 2, potentially a protective factor but underrepresented in examples\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Biological mother, marital status unknown, doesn't strongly correlate with outcome\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n</output>",
