    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the provided example cases to identify patterns.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on observed outcomes.\n3. Apply these weighted factors to the given case for prediction.\n4. Formulate a JSON object with the required information.\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n- The majority of cases have similar characteristics (never married, not cohabiting).\n- Employment status seems to be a significant factor in recidivism outcomes.\n- Household size and living arrangements at age 12 may also play a role.\n- Gender appears less influential than other factors.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   a) Unemployment: High risk\n   b) Never married, not cohabiting: Medium risk (common across most cases)\n   c) Number of jobs held: Low to medium risk (less impact observed)\n   d) Household size at arrest: Medium risk (variable influence)\n   e) Living arrangements at age 12:\n     - Both biological parents: Low risk\n     - Biological mother only, marital status unknown: High risk\n     - Other arrangements (adopted, other adults): Variable, generally high\n\n3. Applying these factors to the given case:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting: Medium risk\n   - Held 2 jobs: Low to medium risk\n   - Household size of 5: Medium risk\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): High risk\n\n4. Formulating the JSON object:\n\n<reflection>\nThe analysis and weight assignment seem reasonable based on the provided examples. However, I should note that:\n1) The sample size is relatively small.\n2) Some factors may have been overlooked due to the limited number of cases.\n3) The influence of age (which was not provided) might be significant.\n\nThese limitations could affect the accuracy of the prediction. It's important to keep these in mind when interpreting the results.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\nBased on the analysis of the provided example cases and applying the weighted risk factors to the given case, here is the JSON object with the required information:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Common across most cases, neutral influence\"),\n    (\"Employment status: Held 2 jobs\", \"low-medium\", \"Some job stability but limited work history\"),\n    (\"Household size of 5 at arrest\", \"medium\", \"Variable influence, potentially higher stress levels\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother only at age 12 (marital status unknown)\", \"high\", \"High risk factor observed in many recidivist cases\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. The case shares common characteristics with most examples, but several factors stand out:\n2. Employment history (2 jobs) provides some stability, but it's not as strong a factor against recidivism.\n3. A household size of 5 introduces potential stress and instability.\n4. Most importantly, living with only the biological mother at age 12 (with unknown marital status) is a high-risk factor observed in many cases that resulted in recidivism.\n\nGiven these factors, there's an 80% confidence level that this individual will experience 3-year rearrest recidivism. However, it's crucial to note that this prediction has limitations due to the small sample size and potential overlooked factors such as age, which could significantly influence outcomes.\n</output>",
