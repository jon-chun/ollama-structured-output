    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll develop a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and correlations.\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor based on their impact in the examples.\n3. Apply these weighted factors to the specific case provided.\n4. Make a prediction based on the overall assessment.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing the examples:\n   - Gender: No clear correlation with outcome\n   - Marital status: Never married seems more common among those who reoffend\n   - Cohabiting status: No significant impact observed\n   - Employment history: Fewer jobs seem to correlate with higher recidivism\n   - Household size: Larger households might be associated with lower recidivism\n   - Living situation at age 12: Biological parents present seems to reduce recidivism risk\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   a) Gender: low impact\n   b) Marital status: medium-high (being married/cohabiting reduces risk)\n   c) Cohabiting status: low impact\n   d) Employment history: high impact (more jobs = lower recidivism)\n   e) Household size: medium-high (larger households = lower recidivism)\n   f) Living situation at age 12: high impact (biological parents present reduces risk)\n\n3. Applying these factors to the specific case:\n   - Male: neutral\n   - Never married, not cohabiting: higher risk\n   - Held only 1 job: higher risk\n   - Household size of 3: moderate risk\n   - Lived with biological mother (marital status unknown) at age 12: moderate-high risk reduction\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, this individual has some high-risk factors but also one significant protective factor.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while the employment history and household size suggest higher recidivism risk, the fact of living with a biological parent at age 12 is a strong protective factor. Additionally, being male doesn't seem to have a significant impact in either direction. This case presents mixed signals, but the balance seems to lean slightly towards lower recidivism risk.\n\nI need to adjust my confidence level accordingly.\n</reflection>\n\n<reflection>\nAfter this reflection, I believe my analysis and prediction are sound. The assigned weights for each factor appear reasonable based on the examples provided. However, I should emphasize that predicting recidivism is inherently complex and uncertain. Therefore, while the factors suggest a lower risk of recidivism, the confidence level should be moderate rather than extremely high or low.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Male gender doesn't appear to have a significant impact on recidivism in these examples.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium-high\", \"Being never married and not cohabiting is associated with higher recidivism risk in the given cases.\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting status\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation observed between cohabiting status and recidivism outcome.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"high\", \"Holding only one job suggests a higher risk of recidivism based on the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium-high\", \"A household size of 3 is relatively small, which might increase the risk of recidivism slightly.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"high\", \"Having lived with biological mother (even if marital status unknown) at age 12 is a significant protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on an analysis of the given examples and the specific case provided. The individual in question presents both risk factors for higher recidivism (never married, not cohabiting, few jobs held, smaller household) and protective factors against it (having lived with a biological parent at age 12).\n\nThe strongest factor in this case appears to be the living situation at age 12, which consistently shows up as a significant protective factor against recidivism in the provided examples. While other factors suggest higher risk, the presence of this protective factor tips the balance towards predicting lower likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHowever, due to the complexity and uncertainty inherent in predicting recidivism based on limited information, the confidence level is set at 60%. This reflects that while the analysis leans towards a \"NO\" prediction, there's still a considerable chance that other factors not considered here could influence the actual outcome.\n</output>",
