    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nLet's approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns in risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each identified risk factor.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the new case for prediction.\n\nStep 1: Analyzing the examples\n- Gender: Males are more prevalent in the dataset but don't always lead to a specific outcome.\n- Marital status: Being married or cohabiting seems to reduce the likelihood of rearrest, but it's not a definitive factor.\n- Employment: Unemployment is associated with higher risk of rearrest in some cases, especially when combined with other factors.\n- Household size: Smaller household sizes seem more frequently associated with rearrest, but this is not consistent across all examples.\n\nStep 2: Assigning relative weights to risk factors\nBased on the analysis:\n- Gender (Female): Low risk factor\n- Never married, not cohabiting: Medium risk factor\n- Currently unemployed: Medium risk factor\n- Household size of 2: High risk factor\n- Lived with biological mother at age 12: Unknown/neutral factor\n\nStep 3: Applying the weighted risk factors to the new case\nNew case:\nThe person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and is currently unemployed with a household size of 2 and lived with their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our analysis:\n- We've correctly identified key risk factors from the examples.\n- The weighting seems reasonable based on the prevalence and impact in the given cases.\n- However, we should consider that multiple medium to high-risk factors might increase the overall risk more than initially assessed.\n</reflection>\n\nAfter reflection, I'll adjust my assessment:\n\n- Gender (Female): Low risk factor\n- Never married, not cohabiting: Medium-high risk factor\n- Currently unemployed: Medium risk factor\n- Household size of 2: High risk factor\n- Lived with biological mother at age 12: Neutral/low risk factor\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering these factors collectively:\n- The presence of multiple medium to high-risk factors (never married, not cohabiting, unemployed, small household) outweighs the low risk associated with being female.\n- While living with a biological mother is generally considered stable, it's neutralized by other factors in this case.\n\nTherefore, I believe there's a moderate to high likelihood of rearrest for this individual.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis and reflection, here's my final prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"Generally associated with lower crime rates\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"medium-high\", \"Lack of stable partnership may increase risk\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"medium\", \"Financial instability can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Household size of 2\", \"high\", \"Smaller household sizes are more frequently associated with rearrest in the examples\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12\", \"neutral/low\", \"Generally considered a stable upbringing, but neutralized by other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis prediction takes into account the combination of risk factors and their relative weights, acknowledging that while there are some positive indicators (female gender, stable childhood), they are outweighed by multiple negative factors.\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\nBased on a careful analysis of the provided examples and weighted risk factor assessment for the new case, here is the prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"Generally associated with lower crime rates\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"medium-high\", \"Lack of stable partnership may increase risk\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"medium\", \"Financial instability can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Household size of 2\", \"high\", \"Smaller household sizes are more frequently associated with rearrest in the examples\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12\", \"neutral/low\", \"Generally considered a stable upbringing, but neutralized by other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. While being female generally lowers the risk of rearrest (low risk factor), this positive indicator is outweighed by several negative factors.\n\n2. The combination of never being married and not cohabiting, current unemployment, and a small household size all contribute to an increased likelihood of rearrest. These factors are associated with instability and lack of support networks, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\n\n3. Despite living with her biological mother at age 12, which is generally considered a stable upbringing, this positive factor is neutralized by the presence of multiple negative factors in this case.\n\n4. The high-risk household size of 2 stands out as particularly concerning, given its frequent association with rearrest in the provided examples.\n\n5. Overall, while there's some uncertainty (reflected in the 70% confidence level), the cumulative effect of these risk factors leads to a prediction of \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nIt's important to note that this prediction is based on patterns observed in the given dataset and may not reflect real-world complexities or individual circumstances. Actual criminal justice outcomes can be influenced by many factors beyond those listed here.\n</output>",
