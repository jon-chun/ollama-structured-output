    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns in risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact.\n3. Apply the weighted risk factor analysis to the specific case given.\n4. Make a prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Estimate confidence level.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing the examples:\n- Gender doesn't seem to be a strong predictor in these cases.\n- Marital status and cohabitation don't appear to significantly affect outcomes.\n- Employment history is not consistently linked with recidivism.\n- Household size shows some correlation with recidivism, particularly larger households (5+).\n- Living situation at age 12 seems important, especially if both biological parents were present.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   - Gender: low\n   - Marital status/cohabitation: low\n   - Employment history: medium\n   - Household size: high\n   - Living situation at age 12: high\n\n3. Applying to the specific case:\n   - Male (low impact)\n   - Never married, not cohabiting (low impact)\n   - Currently unemployed (medium negative factor)\n   - Household size of 6 (high risk factor)\n   - Lived with both biological parents at age 12 (positive factor)\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Given the high-risk household size and medium-negative employment status, but offset by the positive living situation at age 12, the overall risk appears to be moderate. However, considering the case closely matches several recidivism cases in the examples, I'll predict \"YES\".\n\n5. Estimating confidence level:\n   Based on the mixed factors and the complexity of the case, I'll estimate a confidence level around 70%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems sound. The high household size is a significant risk factor, but it's balanced by the positive childhood living situation. The prediction of \"YES\" aligns with several similar cases in the examples. However, I should consider that there are no exact matches to this case in the given examples, which adds some uncertainty.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Male gender doesn't appear to significantly impact recidivism rates based on the provided examples.\"),\n    (\"marital_status/cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Never married and not cohabiting status shows no consistent correlation with recidivism in these cases.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Currently unemployed is a medium-negative factor, as employment history doesn't consistently predict recidivism but unemployment might be slightly riskier.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"high\", \"Household size of 6 is a significant risk factor, as larger households (5+) are more commonly associated with recidivism in these examples.\"),\n    (\"living_situation_at_age_12\", \"high\", \"Living with both biological parents at age 12 is a positive factor, suggesting stability and support during childhood.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on an analysis of the given risk factors for the case. The most significant risk factor in this scenario appears to be the large household size (6), which aligns with several cases in the examples that resulted in recidivism. However, this high-risk factor is somewhat balanced by the positive living situation at age 12, where both biological parents were present.\n\nThe prediction of \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome reflects the overall assessment of these factors. The confidence level is set at 70% due to the complexity of the case and the fact that there are no exact matches in the provided examples. While there are similarities with some high-risk cases, the unique combination of factors introduces some uncertainty into the prediction.\n\n</output>",
