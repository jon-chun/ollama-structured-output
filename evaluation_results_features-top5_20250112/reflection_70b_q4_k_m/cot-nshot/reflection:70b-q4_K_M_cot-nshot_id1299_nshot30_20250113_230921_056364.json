    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll devise a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and potential risk factors.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each identified risk factor based on their impact in the examples.\n3. Evaluate the specific case given for prediction.\n4. Apply the weighted risk factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Determine the confidence level of the prediction.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n   - Gender: Both males and females have shown recidivism, so gender may not be a significant factor.\n   - Marital status: Being married doesn't guarantee no recidivism (Example 28).\n   - Cohabitation status: More cohabiting individuals show recidivism (Examples 16, 25), suggesting this might be a risk factor.\n   - Employment status: Unemployment is associated with higher recidivism rates (Examples 6, 8, 9, 16).\n   - Number of jobs held: This doesn't seem to have a clear pattern.\n   - Household size: Larger households may be slightly more associated with recidivism, but it's not consistent.\n   - Living situation at age 12:\n     - Living with biological parents (Examples 1, 26, 30) seems protective against recidivism.\n     - Other living arrangements are more associated with recidivism.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights to risk factors:\n\n   (\"Cohabitation status\", \"high\", \"More cohabiting individuals show higher recidivism rates\")\n   (\"Employment status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment is associated with higher recidivism, but not always\")\n   (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"high\", \"Non-biological parent living arrangements are more common in recidivist cases\")\n   (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"While larger households may be slightly more associated with recidivism, it's inconsistent\")\n   (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Both genders show similar patterns of recidivism\")\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\n   - Female\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting (protective factor)\n   - Has held 2 jobs (neutral)\n   - Household size: 6 (slightly concerning but not strong evidence)\n\n4. Applying weighted risk factors for prediction:\n   The strongest protective factor is \"not cohabiting,\" which reduces the likelihood of recidivism.\n   Other factors are either neutral or low-risk.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize I may have underestimated the impact of gender and employment status in my initial analysis. While they don't seem to be strong predictors individually, their combination with other factors might be more significant than initially thought. Additionally, the fact that this individual has held 2 jobs could potentially indicate a stable work history, which might further reduce recidivism risk.\n</reflection>\n\n5. Determining prediction and confidence:\n   Based on the analysis, I would predict \"NO\" for recidivism with moderate to high confidence.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter final consideration of all factors and reflection on potential oversights, I believe this prediction aligns with the evidence from the example cases. The protective factor of not cohabiting and potentially stable employment history (2 jobs held) outweigh the slight concern of a larger household size.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"high\", \"Not cohabiting is a strong protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"medium\", \"Having held multiple jobs suggests potential stability, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother doesn't strongly indicate higher or lower risk\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"While larger households may be slightly more associated with recidivism, it's not a strong indicator\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on an analysis of the given example cases and the specific factors present in this individual's situation. The strongest protective factor is the fact that she is not cohabiting, which has been associated with lower recidivism rates in the examples provided.\n\nAdditionally, having held two jobs could indicate a degree of employment stability, potentially reducing the risk of recidivism further. While living with only one biological parent at age 12 and being part of a larger household (size 6) might be considered slightly concerning factors, they are not strong indicators for recidivism in this case.\n\nThe confidence level of 80% reflects that while there are some factors present that could potentially increase the risk of recidivism, the protective factor of not cohabiting and the relatively stable employment history outweigh these concerns. This prediction aligns with the patterns observed in the example cases provided.\n</output>",
