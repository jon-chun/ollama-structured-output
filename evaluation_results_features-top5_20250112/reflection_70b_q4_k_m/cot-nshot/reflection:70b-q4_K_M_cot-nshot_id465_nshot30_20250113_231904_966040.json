    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and significant risk factors.\n2. Assign weights to each risk factor based on their apparent impact in the examples.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the specific case provided.\n4. Make a prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism based on this analysis.\n\nLet's begin:\n\n1. Analyzing the given examples:\n- Gender: Males seem more likely to reoffend than females (17/21 males vs 4/9 females).\n- Marital status/cohabitation: Never married, not cohabiting seems to increase risk.\n- Employment: Current unemployment or fewer jobs held may increase risk.\n- Household size: Larger household sizes could be associated with higher risk.\n- Living situation at age 12: Living with both biological parents appears to lower risk.\n\n2. Assigning weights:\n   - Gender (male): High\n   - Never married, not cohabiting: Medium-High\n   - Current unemployment or fewer jobs: Medium\n   - Larger household size: Medium\n   - Not living with both biological parents at age 12: Low-Medium\n\n3. Applying these to the specific case:\n   - Female: Lower risk\n   - Never married, not cohabiting: Medium-High risk\n   - Held 2 jobs: Relatively stable employment (low-medium risk)\n   - Household size of 3: Neutral to slightly low risk\n   - Lived with other adults at age 12: Low-Medium risk\n\n4. Making the prediction:\nGiven that this case has a mix of positive and negative factors, but overall leans towards lower risk due to gender and employment stability, I would predict \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems sound. However, it's important to note that we're making predictions based on limited data and without considering other potentially significant factors like age, criminal history, or social support systems. The confidence in this prediction should be moderate rather than high.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's formulate the JSON response:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is associated with lower recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital status/cohabitation\", \"medium-high\", \"Never married and not cohabiting may increase social instability\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Having held multiple jobs indicates relative employment stability\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"A household size of 3 is relatively neutral in terms of risk\"),\n    (\"living situation at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Living with other adults, not biological parents, may have some negative impact\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis prediction takes into account the lower risk associated with being female and having relatively stable employment history, while also considering the potential risks of never being married or cohabiting and the uncertain living situation at age 12.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is associated with lower recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital status/cohabitation\", \"medium-high\", \"Never married and not cohabiting may increase social instability\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Having held multiple jobs indicates relative employment stability\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"A household size of 3 is relatively neutral in terms of risk\"),\n    (\"living situation at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Living with other adults, not biological parents, may have some negative impact\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n</output>",
