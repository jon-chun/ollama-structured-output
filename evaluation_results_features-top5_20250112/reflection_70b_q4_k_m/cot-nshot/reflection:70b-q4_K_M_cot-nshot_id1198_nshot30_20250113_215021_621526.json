    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given examples, identify patterns and correlations, assign weights to risk factors, and then apply these findings to predict the outcome for the new case. Let's break it down into steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples:\n   - Identify common risk factors across all cases\n   - Note any apparent correlations between specific factors and outcomes\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor based on their apparent influence:\n   - Never married, not cohabiting: High risk\n   - Employment status: Medium to high risk (unemployment seems more risky)\n   - Household size: Low to medium risk (larger households may be slightly riskier)\n   - Living situation at age 12: Medium risk (non-traditional living situations)\n\n3. Examine the specific case:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting\n   - Has held 1 job\n   - Household size of 3\n\n4. Use the weighted risk factors to make a prediction:\n   - Apply the weights to the given factors for this case\n   - Determine if the cumulative risk is high enough to predict recidivism\n\n5. Estimate confidence level based on how closely this case matches previous examples\n\nLet's work through these steps:\n\n1. Common risk factors and apparent correlations:\n   - Never married, not cohabiting: Consistently present in most cases\n   - Employment status: Unemployment seems more common in positive recidivism cases\n   - Household size: No clear correlation, but larger households are less common\n   - Living situation at age 12: Non-traditional living situations seem slightly riskier\n\n2. Risk factor weights:\n   - Never married, not cohabiting: High (most consistent across all examples)\n   - Employment status: Medium to high (unemployment seems riskier than employment)\n   - Household size: Low to medium (no clear correlation, but larger households may be slightly riskier)\n   - Living situation at age 12: Medium (non-traditional living situations seem slightly riskier)\n\n3. Specific case analysis:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting: High risk\n   - Has held 1 job: Low to medium risk (employed, but limited work history)\n   - Household size of 3: Low risk\n\n4. Prediction:\n   The high-risk factor of being never married and not cohabiting is present.\n   The employment status is low to medium risk.\n   The household size is low risk.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while the factors are generally aligned with non-recidivism patterns from the examples, we should also consider the overall distribution of outcomes in the given data. There were 30 examples provided, and only 4 resulted in recidivism (YES). This suggests a strong bias towards non-recidivism predictions.\n\nGiven this context, even though some risk factors are present, they may not be sufficient to overcome the overall trend of negative recidivism outcomes.\n</reflection>\n\n5. Confidence estimation:\n   Based on the analysis and considering the bias towards non-recidivism in the examples, I would estimate a high confidence level for this prediction.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"High\", \"This factor is consistently present across most cases and appears to have a significant impact on recidivism risk. However, its influence may be mitigated by other factors in this specific case.\"),\n    (\"Has held 1 job\", \"Low-Medium\", \"Employment status generally seems less risky than unemployment, but limited work history might slightly increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 3\", \"Low\", \"No clear correlation with recidivism, and a household size of 3 is relatively small compared to some examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on an analysis of the provided examples and the weighted risk factors for this specific case. While some risk factors are present (e.g., never married, not cohabiting), they seem outweighed by other factors that align more closely with non-recidivism patterns in the given data.\n\nThe high confidence level reflects both the strong bias towards negative recidivism outcomes in the provided examples and the relative alignment of this case's factors with those patterns. However, it's not set at 100% to acknowledge the presence of some risk factors that could potentially influence a different outcome.\n</output>",
