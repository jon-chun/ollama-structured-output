    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nLet's approach this problem step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and relationships between risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n3. Use these weighted risk factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the given case.\n\nLet's start with analyzing the example cases:\n\nObservations:\n- Gender: Males are more likely to reoffend (11 out of 15 male cases resulted in YES, while only 2 out of 10 female cases did)\n- Marital status/cohabitation: Never married and not cohabiting individuals are at higher risk\n- Employment history: Unemployment or fewer jobs held seem to increase recidivism risk\n- Household size: Larger household sizes (5 or more) may be associated with a higher risk of recidivism\n- Family structure at age 12: Living with both biological parents seems to reduce recidivism risk\n\nNow, let's assign weights to the risk factors for the given case:\n\n1. Male gender: Medium risk\n2. Never married and not cohabiting: High risk\n3. Held 4 jobs: Low risk\n4. Household size of 4: Medium risk\n5. Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): Medium risk\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the assignment of weights seems reasonable based on our observations from the example cases. However, we should consider that holding more jobs typically reduces recidivism risk, so we might want to adjust this factor to a lower risk level.\n</reflection>\n\nCorrected weight for \"Held 4 jobs\": Very Low risk\n\nNow, let's predict the outcome and assign confidence:\n\nBased on our analysis:\n- The case has several medium to high-risk factors (gender, marital status, household size, family structure)\n- However, the strong employment history (4 jobs held) is a significant positive factor\n- Overall, this seems to balance out, making it a borderline case\n\nPrediction: NO\nConfidence: 60%\n\n<reflection>\nOur prediction of \"NO\" for recidivism and confidence level of 60% seem reasonable given the mixed factors in this case. The strong employment history tips the scale towards a lower risk of recidivism, but we're not very confident due to other high-risk factors present.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"While males have a higher overall rate of reoffending in our examples, this alone is not decisive\"),\n    (\"Never married and not cohabiting\", \"high\", \"This marital status combination appears to increase recidivism risk significantly\"),\n    (\"Held 4 jobs\", \"very low\", \"A strong employment history typically reduces the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"medium\", \"While larger households are associated with higher risk, this is not extreme enough to be high risk\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\", \"medium\", \"This family structure does not provide strong protection against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n</output>",
