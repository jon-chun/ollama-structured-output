    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and trends.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their correlation with recidivism outcomes.\n3. Use the weighted risk factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the specific case.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the examples:\n\nObservations:\n- Most cases result in \"NO\" for recidivism (24 out of 30).\n- Cases with \"YES\" outcomes often have more severe risk factors.\n- Employment status and household size seem to be significant factors.\n- Living situation at age 12 doesn't appear to strongly influence outcomes.\n\nNow, let's assign weights to the risk factors:\n\n1. Gender: low\n2. Marital status: medium (being married seems to reduce recidivism risk)\n3. Cohabitation status: low\n4. Employment status:\n   - Currently unemployed: high\n   - Held 0-1 job(s): medium\n   - Held 2+ jobs: low\n5. Household size:\n   - Large household (>4): medium-high\n   - Small to average household (\u22644): low\n6. Living situation at age 12: low\n\nNow, let's analyze the specific case:\n\nCase: Female, never married, not cohabiting, held 4 jobs, household size of 4, lived with biological mother whose marital status was unknown at age 12.\n\nRisk factors:\n1. Gender: female (low)\n2. Marital status: never married (medium)\n3. Cohabitation status: not cohabiting (low)\n4. Employment status: held 4 jobs (low)\n5. Household size: 4 (low)\n6. Living situation at age 12: biological mother, marital status unknown (low)\n\n<reflection>\nAfter analyzing the risk factors for this case, it appears that none of the medium to high-risk factors are present. The fact that she has held multiple jobs and lives in a relatively small household suggests lower recidivism risk. However, her never-married status might contribute slightly to higher risk.\n\nGiven these observations, I believe the prediction should lean towards \"NO\" for recidivism. Let's proceed with quantifying this assessment.\n</reflection>\n\nQuantification:\n- Risk factors: 6 (all low)\n- Total weighted risk score: 0 (as all factors are low)\n\n<reflection>\nThe total weighted risk score of 0 indicates a very low risk profile for this individual. This supports our initial conclusion that the prediction should be \"NO\" for recidivism.\n\nNow, let's determine the confidence level:\n</reflection>\n\nConfidence level calculation:\n- Number of low-risk factors: 6\n- Total possible factors: 6\n- Confidence = (Number of low-risk factors / Total possible factors) * 100\n- Confidence = (6 / 6) * 100 = 100%\n\n<reflection>\nA confidence level of 100% seems too high for a prediction based on limited data. We should adjust this to reflect the uncertainty inherent in such predictions.\n</reflection>\n\nAdjusted confidence: 90%\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"While being female doesn't significantly impact recidivism, it's not an indicative factor either.\"),\n    (\"Never married status\", \"medium\", \"Being never married might slightly increase the risk of recidivism due to lack of social support.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"Cohabitation status doesn't seem to strongly influence recidivism outcomes in this dataset.\"),\n    (\"Held 4 jobs\", \"low\", \"Multiple job holdings indicate stability and low risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"low\", \"A relatively small household size suggests lower risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12\", \"low\", \"Living situation at age 12 doesn't appear to significantly impact adult outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n</output>",
