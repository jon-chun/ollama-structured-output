    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll develop a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns in risk factors and their outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided using these weighted risk factors.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Calculate confidence level based on the analysis.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing examples:\n   - Being married and having a spouse present seems to reduce recidivism risk (Example #28).\n   - Larger household sizes may increase risk, but it's not definitive (Examples #6, #9 vs. others with similar factors).\n   - Living with both biological parents at age 12 generally reduces risk.\n   - Number of jobs held doesn't seem to have a clear impact.\n   - Being never married and not cohabiting is common in most examples.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   a) Marital status (married vs. never married): High\n   b) Cohabitation: Medium\n   c) Employment status (currently unemployed vs. employed): Low-Medium\n   d) Household size: Medium-Low\n   e) Living situation at age 12: High\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting: Common in most examples (Medium)\n   - Has held 5 jobs: Neutral factor (Low)\n   - Household size of 2: Potentially lower risk compared to larger households (Low-Medium)\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12: Generally reduces risk (High)\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Given the balanced factors and no strongly positive indicators, I would predict \"NO\" for recidivism.\n\n5. Calculating confidence level:\n   Based on the analysis of patterns and the presence of some risk-reducing factors, I'd estimate confidence at 75%.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my analysis, it seems comprehensive and aligned with the given examples. However, I should note that this is a complex problem involving multiple variables, and real-world recidivism prediction would require more data and sophisticated models. The confidence level of 75% reflects this uncertainty.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married\", \"Medium\", \"This is common in most examples and doesn't strongly influence the outcome\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"Medium\", \"Similar to never married, it's a neutral factor in this case\"),\n    (\"Has held 5 jobs\", \"Low\", \"Number of jobs doesn't seem to have a significant impact on recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Household size of 2\", \"Low-Medium\", \"Smaller household might reduce the risk compared to larger households\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12\", \"High\", \"Generally reduces recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nThis analysis and prediction are based on a careful examination of the provided examples and a weighted assessment of the risk factors for the specific case presented. The prediction is \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism, with a confidence level of 75%.\n\nThe risk factors were assigned weights as follows:\n- Marital status (being never married): Medium\n- Cohabitation status: Medium\n- Employment history (5 jobs held): Low\n- Household size (2): Low-Medium\n- Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother): High\n\nThe presence of some risk-reducing factors, particularly living with the biological mother at age 12 and having a smaller household size, contributes to the \"NO\" prediction. However, the never married and not cohabiting status, which are common in many examples provided, don't strongly influence the outcome either way.\n\nThe confidence level of 75% reflects the complexity of recidivism prediction and the limitations of this analysis based on a relatively small set of examples. In real-world scenarios, predicting recidivism would involve more extensive data and sophisticated models to account for numerous variables beyond those presented here.\n</output>",
