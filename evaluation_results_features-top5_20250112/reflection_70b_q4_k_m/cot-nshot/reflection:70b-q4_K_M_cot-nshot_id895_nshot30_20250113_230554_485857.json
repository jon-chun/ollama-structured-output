    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and risk factors.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact in the examples.\n3. Apply the weighted risk factors to the case we need to predict for.\n4. Make a prediction based on the analysis.\n\nLet's start with step 1:\n\nAnalyzing the given examples:\n- Male gender seems to have higher recidivism rates than female.\n- Never married, not cohabiting status is common in both outcomes.\n- Unemployment or fewer jobs held tends to correlate with recidivism.\n- Larger household sizes seem more often associated with recidivism.\n- Living with biological parents at age 12 appears protective against recidivism.\n- Cohabitation (when mentioned) seems to increase the risk of recidivism.\n\nNow, let's assign weights and reasoning:\n\n1. Male gender: Medium - While it seems associated with higher rates, it's not a strong predictor alone.\n2. Never married, not cohabiting: Low - This is common in both outcomes, so not strongly predictive.\n3. Currently unemployed: High - Unemployment or fewer jobs held correlates with recidivism more often.\n4. Household size of 7: High - Larger household sizes are associated with higher recidivism rates.\n5. No information about living situation at age 12: Unknown\n\nNow, let's apply these factors to the case:\n\nThe person is a male who is never married, not cohabiting and is currently unemployed with a household size of 7.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while we don't have information about the living situation at age 12 for this case, it's an important factor in many examples. We should include this as \"unknown\" in our risk factors.\n</reflection>\n\nRisk factors and prediction:\n1. Male gender (Medium): Not strongly predictive alone\n2. Never married, not cohabiting (Low): Common in both outcomes, not strongly predictive\n3. Currently unemployed (High): Strongly associated with recidivism\n4. Household size of 7 (High): Larger households are more often associated with recidivism\n5. Living situation at age 12 (Unknown): We can't factor this in due to lack of information\n\nBased on these factors, the prediction should be YES, as two high-risk factors outweigh the low and medium risk ones.\n\nConfidence level:\nGiven that we're missing one important piece of information (living situation at age 12), our confidence shouldn't be extremely high. Let's estimate a confidence level of 70%.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter this analysis, I believe the prediction is correct based on the given examples. The strong factors of unemployment and large household size outweigh the less predictive ones. However, it's important to note that missing information about the living situation at age 12 could potentially change our interpretation if we had more context.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"While male gender is associated with higher recidivism rates in some examples, it's not a strong predictor alone.\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"This status is common in both positive and negative outcomes, making it less predictive.\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"high\", \"Unemployment or fewer jobs held is strongly correlated with recidivism in the given examples.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 7\", \"high\", \"Larger household sizes are more often associated with higher recidivism rates in the provided cases.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"unknown\", \"No information available for this potentially important factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
