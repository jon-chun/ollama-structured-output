    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns in risk factors and recidivism outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the specific case provided.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Determine the confidence level of the prediction.\n\nLet's go through this process:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n- Unemployment seems to increase recidivism risk (Examples #6, #8, and #9).\n- Cohabiting or being married decreases recidivism risk (Example #28).\n- Living with both biological parents at age 12 generally indicates lower recidivism risk.\n- Household size doesn't seem to have a clear pattern.\n- Gender alone doesn't appear to be a strong predictor.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights to each risk factor:\n- Unemployment: High\n- Never married, not cohabiting: Medium\n- Number of jobs held: Low (more jobs slightly decreases risk)\n- Household size: Low (no clear impact)\n- Living with both biological parents at age 12: Low (slightly decreases risk)\n- Gender: Very Low (not a significant factor)\n\n3. Applying these to the specific case:\n- The person is male (Very Low)\n- Never married, not cohabiting (Medium)\n- Has held 2 jobs (Low - slightly positive)\n- Household size of 4 (Low - neutral)\n- Lived with biological dad at age 12 (Low - slightly positive)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize I may have underestimated the impact of living arrangements at age 12. The fact that this person lived with their biological dad (marital status unknown) might be a stronger protective factor than initially considered. Let's revise this to Medium.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Making the prediction:\nBased on these factors, especially considering employment and family history, I would predict \"NO\" for recidivism.\n\n5. Determining confidence level:\nThe factors here align more with non-recidivist profiles in the examples (e.g., #22). The presence of steady employment (2 jobs) and a somewhat stable upbringing (with biological dad) are positive indicators. This gives me moderate to high confidence in the prediction.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter final consideration, I'm confident in my analysis and conclusion. The factors align well with non-recidivist patterns, especially considering the person has held multiple jobs and had some family stability at age 12.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (male)\", \"Very Low\", \"No significant impact on recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"Medium\", \"Increases recidivism risk due to lack of stable relationships\"),\n    (\"Employment (2 jobs held)\", \"Low\", \"Slightly decreases recidivism risk due to steady employment history\"),\n    (\"Household size (4)\", \"Low\", \"No clear impact on recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Living with biological dad at age 12 (marital status unknown)\", \"Medium\", \"Mildly decreases recidivism risk due to some family stability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\n</output>",
