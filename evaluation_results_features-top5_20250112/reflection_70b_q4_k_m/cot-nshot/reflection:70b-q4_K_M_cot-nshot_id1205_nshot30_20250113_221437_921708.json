    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and correlations.\n2. Assign weights to each risk factor based on their observed impact in the examples.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided using the weighted risk factors.\n4. Make a prediction based on the analysis.\n5. Estimate confidence level for the prediction.\n\nLet's start with the analysis:\n\n1. Patterns from examples:\n- Employment status has a significant impact, with unemployed individuals being more likely to recidivate.\n- Household size seems to have an inverse relationship with recidivism risk.\n- Living arrangements at age 12 show varying effects but generally indicate higher risk if not living with both biological parents.\n- Gender doesn't seem to be a strong predictor on its own.\n- Number of jobs held is inconsistent in its impact.\n- Marital status and cohabitation are generally associated with lower recidivism risk.\n\n2. Weighted risk factors:\na) Employment status: High (currently unemployed)\nb) Household size: Low-Medium (household size of 3, which is smaller than many cases but still not the smallest)\nc) Living arrangements at age 12: Medium-High (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while household size generally correlates inversely with recidivism risk, a size of 3 might be too small to confidently assign low risk. Therefore, I'm upgrading this factor's weight from Low-Medium to Medium.\n</reflection>\n\nc) Living arrangements at age 12: Medium-High (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n<reflection>\nAfter considering the living arrangement more closely, I believe it should actually be considered High risk rather than Medium-High. This is because not knowing the marital status of the mother could indicate instability or uncertainty in the home environment during a critical developmental period.\n</reflection>\n\nc) Living arrangements at age 12: High (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\n- Female who is never married and not cohabiting\n- Currently unemployed\n- Household size of 3\n- Lived with biological mother (marital status unknown) at age 12\n\n4. Prediction:\nBased on this analysis, I predict a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\n5. Confidence level:\nGiven the factors present in this case and their weights, I estimate a confidence level of 70% for predicting \"YES\" for recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter completing the analysis and prediction, I believe the reasoning is sound based on the patterns observed in the examples provided. The high risk employment status combined with potentially unstable living arrangements at age 12 tip the balance towards a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender doesn't strongly correlate with increased recidivism risk in these examples\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low-medium\", \"Never married and not cohabiting, which is common among both recidivists and non-recidivists in the examples\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Currently unemployed, which has been a strong predictor of increased recidivism risk in many examples\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"A household size of 3 is relatively small and may indicate some level of financial or social stress\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements_at_age_12\", \"high\", \"Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown, which could indicate instability in the home environment during a critical developmental period\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
