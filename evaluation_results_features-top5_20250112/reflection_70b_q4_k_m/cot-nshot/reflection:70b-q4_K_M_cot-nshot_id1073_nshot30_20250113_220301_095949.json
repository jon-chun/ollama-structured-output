    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll need to analyze the given examples, identify patterns, assign weights to risk factors, and then apply these insights to predict the outcome for the specific case. Let's break this down into steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples:\n   - Identify consistent patterns between risk factors and outcomes\n   - Note any exceptions or contradictions\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor:\n   - Based on frequency of appearance in positive outcomes\n   - Consider interactions between multiple factors\n\n3. Apply weighted risk factors to the specific case:\n   - Assess the presence and weight of each factor\n   - Calculate a cumulative risk score\n\n4. Make a prediction based on the risk score:\n   - Compare with patterns from examples\n   - Adjust for confidence level\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing the given examples:\n   - Employment status seems to be a strong predictor (unemployed often leads to positive outcome)\n   - Living situation at age 12 is frequently mentioned in positive outcomes\n   - Household size may have some impact but is less consistent\n   - Gender and marital/cohabitation status seem less predictive\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   - Employment status: High (unemployment strongly associated with positive outcome)\n   - Living situation at age 12: Medium-High (especially if not living with both biological parents)\n   - Household size: Low-Medium (inconsistent impact, but larger households might increase risk slightly)\n\n3. Applying weighted risk factors to the specific case:\n   - Employment status: Unemployed (High weight, positive predictor)\n   - Living situation at age 12: Biological mother, marital status unknown (Medium-High weight, positive predictor)\n   - Household size: 4 (Low-Medium weight, potentially neutral or slightly negative)\n\nCumulative risk score: High + Medium-High + Low-Medium = Very High\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Based on the high cumulative risk score and patterns from the examples, the most likely outcome is positive.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems sound, but I should consider the confidence level more carefully. While the predictors are strong, there might be some uncertainty due to the complexity of real-world scenarios. Let me adjust the confidence slightly.\n</reflection>\n\nFinal prediction:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Employment status: Unemployed\", \"High\", \"Strongly associated with positive outcome in examples\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Biological mother, marital status unknown\", \"Medium-High\", \"Frequently seen in positive outcomes, may indicate instability or lack of support system\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"Low-Medium\", \"Inconsistent impact, but larger households might increase risk slightly\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nThis JSON object presents the weighted risk factors and their reasoning, along with the final prediction and a confidence level of 85%.\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Employment status: Unemployed\", \"High\", \"Strongly associated with positive outcome in examples\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Biological mother, marital status unknown\", \"Medium-High\", \"Frequently seen in positive outcomes, may indicate instability or lack of support system\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"Low-Medium\", \"Inconsistent impact, but larger households might increase risk slightly\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n</output>",
