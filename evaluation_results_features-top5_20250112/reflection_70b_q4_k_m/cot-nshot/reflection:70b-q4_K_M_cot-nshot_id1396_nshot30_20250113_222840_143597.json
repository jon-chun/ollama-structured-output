    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll need to analyze the given examples, identify patterns, weight risk factors, and then apply this knowledge to make a prediction for the new case. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze the example cases:\n   - Identify common risk factors and their correlations with outcomes\n   - Look for patterns in demographics, employment status, household size, and family situation\n\n2. Weight risk factors:\n   - Gender: Low impact (both males and females are represented)\n   - Marital Status: Low-Medium impact (mostly never married, not cohabiting)\n   - Employment: Medium impact (employed vs unemployed)\n   - Household Size: Medium impact (varies but often larger households are more common in negative outcomes)\n   - Family Situation at Age 12: High impact (living with both biological parents seems protective)\n\n3. Analyze the new case:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting\n   - Held 2 jobs (employed)\n   - Household size of 5\n   - Lived with both biological parents at age 12\n\n4. Assign weights and reasoning for each factor in the new case\n\n5. Make a prediction based on the weighted factors and confidence level\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n- Living with both biological parents at age 12 appears to be strongly correlated with positive outcomes (no rearrest).\n- Larger household sizes, especially 6 or more, seem to increase the risk of negative outcomes.\n- Employment status is mixed, but consistently employed individuals might have a slight advantage.\n\n2. Weighting risk factors:\n   - Gender: Low\n   - Marital Status: Low-Medium\n   - Employment: Medium\n   - Household Size: Medium\n   - Family Situation at Age 12: High\n\n3. Analyzing the new case:\nThe individual is a male, never married, not cohabiting, has held 2 jobs, lives in a household of 5, and lived with both biological parents at age 12.\n\n4. Assigning weights and reasoning for each factor:\n\na) Gender (Male): Low risk\nThe gender distribution is balanced across all examples, so it doesn't seem to be a strong predictor.\n\nb) Marital Status (Never Married, Not Cohabiting): Medium risk\nWhile most cases are never married and not cohabiting, this alone doesn't determine the outcome. It's neutral in this case as it matches the majority of examples.\n\nc) Employment (Held 2 jobs): Low-Medium risk\nBeing employed is generally positive, but holding only two jobs might indicate some instability or lack of long-term commitment to a single job.\n\nd) Household Size (5): Medium-Low risk\nA household size of 5 is moderate and doesn't strongly correlate with negative outcomes in the examples provided.\n\ne) Family Situation at Age 12 (Both Biological Parents): High protective factor\nLiving with both biological parents at age 12 appears to be a strong indicator of positive outcomes across most examples.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that the family situation at age 12 might have an even stronger impact than initially considered. In all cases where an individual lived with both biological parents at age 12 (Examples 1, 3, 10, 22, and 30), there were no instances of rearrest. This suggests a significant protective factor.\n</reflection>\n\n5. Making a prediction:\nBased on the analysis, especially considering the strong positive correlation between living with both biological parents at age 12 and lack of rearrest, I predict that this individual is unlikely to be rearrested within three years.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter careful consideration, I believe my reasoning is sound. The protective factor of having lived with both biological parents outweighs other potential risks. This aligns with social science research suggesting the importance of stable family environments in reducing criminal recidivism rates.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (Male)\", \"low\", \"The gender distribution is balanced across all examples, so it doesn't seem to be a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (Never Married, Not Cohabiting)\", \"medium\", \"While most cases are never married and not cohabiting, this alone doesn't determine the outcome.

The key factor driving this prediction is the individual's family situation at age 12, having lived with both biological parents, which appears to be a strong protective factor against rearrest in all observed examples.\n\nAdditionally, while there are some potential medium-level risks such as never being married and not cohabiting, or holding only two jobs, these factors do not seem to significantly outweigh the positive impact of the stable family environment during childhood. The household size of 5 is also within a range that doesn't strongly correlate with negative outcomes in the given examples.\n\nGiven this analysis, I am 85% confident that this individual will not be rearrested within three years. This high confidence level reflects the consistent pattern observed in the example cases where individuals who lived with both biological parents at age 12 had no instances of rearrest.\n</output>",
