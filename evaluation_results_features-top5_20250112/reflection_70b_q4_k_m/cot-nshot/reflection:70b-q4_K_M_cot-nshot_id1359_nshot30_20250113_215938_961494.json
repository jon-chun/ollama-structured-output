    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns in risk factors that lead to rearrest recidivism.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the new case provided.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Determine confidence level in the prediction.\n\nLet's go through this process:\n\n1. Analyzing examples:\n   - Gender: No clear pattern, both males and females have YES and NO outcomes.\n   - Marital status: Being never married seems to be more common among those who rearrested, but it's not conclusive.\n   - Employment history: Unemployment is present in some cases with YES outcome, but job stability doesn't guarantee NO outcome.\n   - Household size: Varied across all examples, no clear pattern.\n   - Living situation at age 12: This seems to have the strongest correlation. Those living with both biological parents are less likely to rearrest.\n\n2. Assigning weights:\n   a) Gender: low\n   b) Marital status: medium\n   c) Employment history: high\n   d) Household size: low\n   e) Living situation at age 12: high\n\n3. Applying weighted risk factors to the new case:\n   - Male, never married, not cohabiting (medium)\n   - Currently unemployed (high)\n   - Household size of 5 (low)\n   - Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12 (high)\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Based on the analysis and weighted risk factors, there are some concerning signs for this case:\n   - Unemployment history is a high-risk factor\n   - Living situation at age 12 (not both parents) is a high-risk factor\n   However, the overall pattern suggests that these alone don't guarantee rearrest. The lack of job stability and less stable childhood environment increase the risk.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I should reconsider the weight assigned to household size. While it doesn't seem to be strongly correlated in the examples, it might have some influence when combined with other factors. Let me adjust this:\n\na) Gender: low\nb) Marital status: medium\nc) Employment history: high\nd) Household size: medium (not just low)\ne) Living situation at age 12: high\n\nThis adjustment better reflects that while household size alone isn't a strong indicator, it could contribute to overall risk when combined with other factors.\n</reflection>\n\n5. Determining confidence level:\n   Given the complexity of factors and potential interactions between them, I'll assign a moderate confidence level of 60%.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (Male)\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern in gender across all examples.\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"While more common among those who rearrested, this alone isn't conclusive.\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"high\", \"Unemployment history is strongly associated with YES outcomes in the given examples.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 5\", \"medium\", \"While no clear pattern in household size overall, it could contribute to risk when combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12\", \"high\", \"Not living with both parents is strongly associated with YES outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n</output>",
