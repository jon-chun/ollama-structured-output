    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll devise a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and risk factors.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the target case.\n4. Make a prediction based on the analysis.\n5. Determine confidence level.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing examples:\n   - Gender: Male is more common than female in recidivism cases\n   - Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting is more common in recidivism cases\n   - Employment status: Unemployment is associated with higher recidivism risk\n   - Household size: Larger households may be associated with lower recidivism risk\n   - Family structure at age 12: Biological parents present is generally less risky than other scenarios\n\n2. Assigning weights:\n   a) Gender: Medium (males are more likely to recidivate, but it's not the strongest factor)\n   b) Marital status: High (never married, not cohabiting seems to be strongly associated with recidivism)\n   c) Employment status: High (unemployment is a significant risk factor)\n   d) Household size: Low (while larger households might be less risky, it's not as strong of an indicator)\n   e) Family structure at age 12: Medium (biological parents present generally reduces risk)\n\n3. Applying to the target case:\n   - Gender: Male (medium)\n   - Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting (high)\n   - Employment status: Currently unemployed (high)\n   - Household size: 4 (low)\n   - Family structure at age 12: Biological mother, marital status unknown (medium)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while the plan is good, we need to consider how these factors interact. The high risk of unemployment and never married status might outweigh some of the less risky factors.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, particularly the high-risk factors of unemployment and marital status, combined with the medium-risk gender factor, I predict that this individual is likely to recidivate within 3 years.\n\n5. Determining confidence level:\n   Given the presence of strong risk factors (unemployment, never married) and considering the overall pattern in the examples provided, I would rate the confidence at about 70%.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter completing the analysis and prediction, I believe the reasoning is sound. The high-risk factors are well-justified based on the patterns observed in the examples. However, it's important to note that real-world recidivism prediction models are much more complex and consider many additional factors. This simplified approach should be understood as a basic demonstration rather than an actual predictive tool for real-life criminal justice applications.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"medium\", \"Males were more common in recidivism cases, but it's not the strongest factor\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting\", \"high\", \"This status was strongly associated with higher recidivism risk in the given examples\"),\n    (\"Employment status: Currently unemployed\", \"high\", \"Unemployment consistently appeared as a significant risk factor across the examples\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"low\", \"While larger households might be less risky, this factor doesn't seem to have as strong of an impact\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12: Biological mother, marital status unknown\", \"medium\", \"This is generally less risky than other family structures but not ideal\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
