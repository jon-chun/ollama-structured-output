    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases and identify patterns in risk factors that lead to recidivism.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on the analysis.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided using the weighted risk factors.\n4. Make a prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n   - Employment status: Unemployment seems to increase recidivism risk.\n   - Household size: Larger households might be associated with higher risk.\n   - Living situation at age 12: Deviations from both biological parents seem to increase risk.\n   - Gender: Females generally have lower recidivism rates in these examples.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   a) Employment status: High (unemployed), Medium (1-2 jobs), Low (>3 jobs)\n   b) Household size: Medium (4-5 people), High (>6 people), Low (<3 people)\n   c) Living situation at age 12: High (not both biological parents), Medium (unknown/other situations), Low (both biological parents)\n   d) Gender: Low (female), High (male)\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\n   - Female, never married, not cohabiting\n   - Held 4 jobs (Low risk)\n   - Household size of 6 (High risk)\n   - Lived with biological mother and other parent present at age 12 (Medium risk)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize I may have misjudged the living situation. \"Biological mother, other parent present\" is actually a stable family environment, which should be considered Low risk.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Prediction:\n   Based on these factors, we can make a prediction.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter considering all factors and their weights, I believe my initial analysis was correct in terms of factor importance, but the living situation needed correction. The overall risk profile seems moderate, leaning towards low due to the female gender and stable employment history.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Female\", \"low\", \"Generally lower recidivism rates among females\"),\n    (\"Employment status: Held 4 jobs\", \"low\", \"Stable employment history reduces risk\"),\n    (\"Household size: 6 people\", \"high\", \"Larger households may indicate higher stress levels or less stable environments\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Biological mother, other parent present\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment during childhood\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n</output>",
