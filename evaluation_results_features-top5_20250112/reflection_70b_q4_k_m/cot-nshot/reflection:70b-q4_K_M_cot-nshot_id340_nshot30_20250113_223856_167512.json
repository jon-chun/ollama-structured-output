The key factors influencing this decision are:\n\n1. Gender: While male gender is considered a moderate risk factor, it's not sufficient on its own to predict recidivism.\n\n2. Employment History: Holding multiple jobs (in this case, 3) is strongly correlated with non-recidivism in the provided examples.\n\n3. Family Environment: Living with both biological parents at age 12 indicates a stable childhood environment, which is associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nThese factors collectively point towards a low likelihood of rearrest. The moderate risk factor of male gender is outweighed by the strong positive indicators of employment stability and a stable family background.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 90% because while the prediction is strongly supported by the given data, there may be other unconsidered factors that could potentially influence recidivism. However, based on the information provided in the example cases, the likelihood of non-recidivism appears to be quite high for this individual.\n\n</output>",
