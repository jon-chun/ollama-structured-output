    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the example cases to identify patterns and relationships between risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact in the examples.\n3. Apply the weighted analysis to the given case.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Determine the confidence level for the prediction.\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n- Employment status and number of jobs held seem to have an impact on outcomes.\n- Household size appears to be relevant.\n- Living arrangements at age 12 are important, especially if not with both biological parents.\n- Gender seems to play a role in some cases.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights to risk factors:\n\na) Never married, not cohabiting: Medium\nb) Number of jobs held:\n   - Currently unemployed: High\n   - Held 1 job: Medium\n   - Held multiple jobs (2+): Low\nc) Household size: Medium\nd) Living arrangements at age 12:\n   - Both biological parents: Low\n   - Biological mother, marital status unknown: Medium to High\n   - Biological father, marital status unknown: Medium\n   - Other living situations: High\n\n3. Applying weighted analysis to the given case:\n\n- Never married, not cohabiting: Medium\n- Held 1 job: Medium\n- Household size of 4: Medium\n- Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown at age 12: Medium\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that living with a single parent (in this case, the father) might be less risky than other non-traditional arrangements. Therefore, I should adjust the weight for \"Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown\" from Medium to Low.\n</reflection>\n\nCorrected analysis:\n- Never married, not cohabiting: Medium\n- Held 1 job: Medium\n- Household size of 4: Medium\n- Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown at age 12: Low\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n\nBased on the weighted analysis, this case has two medium and two low-risk factors. The overall risk profile appears to be relatively low.\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering the moderate number of low-to-medium risk factors, it's likely that this individual is less likely to recidivate within 3 years. However, we should also consider that the majority of examples (24 out of 30) result in \"NO\" for recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\nGiven this reflection, I'm confident in predicting a negative outcome for recidivism.\n\n5. Determining confidence level:\n\nConsidering the overall low-to-medium risk profile and the patterns observed in the example cases, I would rate my confidence at around 85%.\n\n<reflection>\nThis confidence level seems reasonable given that we have some risk factors present but not extreme ones. It also accounts for potential uncertainties or unforeseen circumstances.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"Medium\", \"This factor alone doesn't strongly indicate a high recidivism risk but contributes to the overall profile.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job\", \"Medium\", \"Limited employment history is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"Medium\", \"A medium-sized household can be both supportive and stressful, making it a neutral factor in this case.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown at age 12\", \"Low\", \"Growing up with one biological parent is less ideal than two but better than other non-traditional arrangements.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n</output>",
