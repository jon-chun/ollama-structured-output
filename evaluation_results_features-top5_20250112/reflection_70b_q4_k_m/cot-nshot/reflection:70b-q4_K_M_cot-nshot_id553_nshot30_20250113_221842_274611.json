    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given examples, identify patterns and correlations with the outcomes, assign weights to risk factors, and then apply these to the new case. Let's break it down:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples:\n   - Review each example's risk factors and corresponding outcome\n   - Identify common factors in cases with \"YES\" outcomes\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor based on their frequency in positive outcomes:\n   - Gender: Low (both males and females have similar outcomes)\n   - Marital status: Medium (cohabiting status seems to increase risk slightly)\n   - Employment history: Medium-High (unemployment or few jobs seem more common in positive cases)\n   - Household size: High (larger households correlate with positive outcomes)\n   - Living situation at age 12: Medium (non-traditional family structures may increase risk)\n\n3. Analyze the new case:\n   - Female, never married, not cohabiting\n   - Held only 1 job\n   - Household size of 6\n\n4. Apply weighted risk factors to predict outcome:\n   - Gender: Low risk\n   - Marital status: Medium risk (not cohabiting)\n   - Employment history: High risk (only 1 job)\n   - Household size: High risk (large household)\n   - Living situation at age 12: Not provided, assume neutral\n\n5. Make the final prediction and estimate confidence level:\n   - Prediction: \"YES\" due to high-risk factors in employment history and household size\n   - Confidence: Medium-High (around 70-80%) as not all risk factors are present\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our analysis:\n1. The weight assignment seems reasonable, but we should consider that cohabiting status was only a factor in one positive case.\n2. We correctly identified the high-risk factors for the new case.\n3. Our prediction of \"YES\" aligns with the presence of significant risk factors.\n\nThe confidence level might be too high given the lack of information about living situation at age 12 and the fact that gender is neutral. Let's adjust this to around 60%.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this reflection, we can refine our output.\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Both male and female cases have similar outcomes\"),\n    (\"Marital status (not cohabiting)\", \"medium\", \"Not a strong indicator in most cases, but may contribute to risk\"),\n    (\"Employment history (only 1 job)\", \"high\", \"Limited employment history is common in positive outcome cases\"),\n    (\"Household size of 6\", \"high\", \"Larger households are more frequent in positive outcome cases\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n</output>",
