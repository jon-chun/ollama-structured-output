    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and correlations.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided.\n4. Predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the given case.\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyzing examples:\n- Gender: Males are more likely to reoffend than females (14/17 males vs 2/8 females)\n- Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting is associated with higher recidivism\n- Employment: Current unemployment increases recidivism risk\n- Household size: Larger households (>4) seem to increase recidivism risk\n- Living arrangements at age 12: Those living with biological parents have lower recidivism rates\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\na) Gender (male): High\nb) Marital status (never married, not cohabiting): Medium\nc) Employment (currently unemployed): High\nd) Household size (>4): Medium\ne) Living arrangements at age 12: Low\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\n- Male\n- Never married, not cohabiting\n- Currently unemployed\n- Household size of 8\n- Lived with biological mother at age 12 (unknown marital status)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while \"lived with biological mother\" is typically a low-risk factor, the unknown marital status might increase risk. Let's adjust this to medium.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Predicting outcome:\nBased on the analysis and weighted factors:\n\na) Gender: High (increases recidivism risk)\nb) Marital status: Medium (increases recidivism risk)\nc) Employment: High (significantly increases recidivism risk)\nd) Household size: Medium (slightly increases recidivism risk)\ne) Living arrangements at age 12: Medium (unknown marital status of mother)\n\nThe high-risk factors (gender and unemployment) combined with multiple medium-risk factors indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the prediction should be \"YES\" for this case. The combination of high-risk factors (male gender and current unemployment), along with several medium-risk factors, outweighs the potentially lower risk from living with a biological parent at age 12.\n</reflection>\n\nConfidence level: 85%\n\n<reflection>\nReflecting on the analysis, I believe this confidence level is appropriate. While there are strong indicators for recidivism, not all high-risk cases reoffend, and some medium-risk factors might have mitigating effects in certain circumstances.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"High\", \"Males have shown a higher recidivism rate in the given examples\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"Medium\", \"This marital status has been associated with a slightly increased risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"High\", \"Unemployment at the time of analysis significantly increases the risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size: 8\", \"Medium\", \"Larger household sizes appear to be correlated with higher recidivism rates in the examples provided\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12 (unknown marital status)\", \"Medium\", \"While living with a biological parent typically reduces risk, the unknown marital status of the mother introduces uncertainty and potential instability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\n</output>",
