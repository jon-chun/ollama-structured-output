    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and relationships between risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the specific case provided for prediction.\n4. Formulate a final prediction with confidence level.\n\nLet's start with step 1:\n\nAnalyzing the examples:\n- Most cases with \"never married, not cohabiting\" and employment (even if currently unemployed) tend towards NO recidivism.\n- Household size doesn't seem to have a clear impact on outcomes.\n- Living arrangements at age 12 show mixed results but may indicate some risk when not living with both biological parents.\n- Gender seems to have minimal impact overall.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights:\n\n1. Marital status (never married, not cohabiting): Medium\n2. Employment status: Low-Medium (currently unemployed is a slight risk)\n3. Household size: Low\n4. Living arrangements at age 12: Medium\n\nFor the specific case:\n- Female (low impact)\n- Never married, not cohabiting: Medium risk\n- Held 3 jobs: Lower risk compared to unemployment or fewer jobs\n- Household size of 3: Low impact\n- Lived with biological mother and other parent present at age 12: Lower risk\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive. However, we should consider the number of jobs held (3) as a potential positive factor since it indicates more stability than holding fewer jobs or being unemployed.\n</reflection>\n\nLet's adjust our analysis:\n- Held 3 jobs: Low-Medium risk (positive factor)\n\nNow, let's formulate the prediction:\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering all factors, this case seems to have more positive indicators than negative ones. The subject has a stable employment history and lived with both parents at age 12. While being never married and not cohabiting is a medium risk factor, it's outweighed by the positive factors.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is likely to be NO.\n\nConfidence level: 80% (considering the overall positive indicators but acknowledging some remaining risks)\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender appears to have a minimal impact on recidivism outcomes in these examples.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and not cohabiting is present in both positive and negative outcomes, indicating a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"low-medium\", \"Having held 3 jobs indicates employment stability and is generally associated with lower recidivism risk compared to fewer jobs or unemployment.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Household size of 3 doesn't seem to have a significant impact on outcomes in these examples.\"),\n    (\"living arrangements at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother and other parent present suggests a relatively stable upbringing.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on an analysis of the provided n-shot examples and the specific case details. The subject's employment history, living arrangements at age 12, and overall demographic factors contribute to a lower perceived risk for recidivism.\n\nThe weighted risk factor analysis shows that while being never married and not cohabiting (medium risk) is present, it is outweighed by positive indicators such as stable employment (low-medium risk) and a seemingly stable upbringing (medium risk). The gender and household size factors are considered low impact based on the pattern observed in the examples.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is NO, with an 80% confidence level. This high confidence stems from the combination of positive indicators outweighing potential risks.\n</output>",
