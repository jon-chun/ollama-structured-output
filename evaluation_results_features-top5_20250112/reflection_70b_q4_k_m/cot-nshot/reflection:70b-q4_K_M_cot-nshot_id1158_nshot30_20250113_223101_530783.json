    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll develop a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns and significant risk factors.\n2. Assign relative weights to each risk factor based on their impact in the examples.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the new case provided.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Determine the confidence level of the prediction.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing patterns and significant risk factors:\n   - Gender doesn't seem to significantly impact outcomes\n   - Marital status/cohabitation has some influence, especially when combined with other factors\n   - Employment history appears crucial\n   - Household size is a moderate factor\n   - Living situation at age 12 seems important\n\n2. Assigning relative weights and textual reasoning:\n   a) Gender: low (no significant difference in outcomes)\n   b) Marital status/cohabitation: medium to high (especially when combined with other factors)\n   c) Employment history: high (consistent employment is a strong protective factor)\n   d) Household size: medium (larger households may increase risk slightly)\n   e) Living situation at age 12: medium to high (stability in upbringing seems beneficial)\n\n3. Applying these weighted risk factors to the new case:\n   - Male, never married, cohabiting: moderate risk\n   - Held only one job: high risk\n   - Household size of 4: moderate risk\n   - Lived with biological mother (marital status unknown) at age 12: moderate risk\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that the employment history factor is particularly significant in this case. The fact that the individual has held only one job stands out as a high-risk indicator compared to others who had multiple jobs or were consistently employed.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Given the combination of factors, especially the limited employment history and moderate risks from other factors, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n5. Determining confidence level:\n   Based on the analysis, I would rate the confidence at 80%. The strong risk factor of limited employment history combined with several moderate risk factors gives a high likelihood of recidivism, but there's always some uncertainty in such predictions.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"The individual being male doesn't significantly impact the prediction as gender hasn't shown to be a strong risk factor in the examples.\"),\n    (\"marital status/cohabitation\", \"medium\", \"Being never married but cohabiting is a moderate risk factor, especially when combined with limited employment history.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"high\", \"Having held only one job is a significant high-risk indicator for recidivism based on patterns in the provided examples.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"A household size of 4 is considered a moderate risk factor, as larger households may slightly increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother (marital status unknown) at age 12 is a moderate risk factor due to potential instability in upbringing.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on an analysis of the provided examples and weighted risk factors. The most significant risk factor for this individual is their limited employment history, having held only one job, which stands out as a high-risk indicator compared to others in the examples. When combined with moderate risks from being never married but cohabiting, living with biological mother (marital status unknown) at age 12, and a household size of 4, these factors collectively suggest a high likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 80% due to the strong risk factor of limited employment history combined with several moderate risk factors. However, there's always some uncertainty in such predictions, which accounts for the less than 100% confidence.\n</output>",
