    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll need to devise a step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze the given example cases to identify patterns and correlations.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their impact in the examples.\n3. Evaluate the specific case provided and apply the weighted risk factors.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Determine the confidence level of the prediction.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing example cases:\n   - Employment status seems to have an impact: currently unemployed often leads to \"YES\" outcomes.\n   - Household size and marital status don't show a clear pattern.\n   - Living situation at age 12 has some influence, with biological parents showing lower recidivism rates.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n   - Gender: low (no clear pattern)\n   - Marital status: medium (cohabiting might reduce risk slightly)\n   - Employment status: high (unemployed often leads to \"YES\" outcomes)\n   - Household size: low (no clear pattern)\n   - Living situation at age 12: medium (biological parents seem protective)\n\n3. Evaluating the specific case:\n   - Female, never married, cohabiting\n   - Currently unemployed\n   - Household size of 4\n   - Lived with biological mother and other parent present at age 12\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize I should also consider the overall pattern of \"YES\" outcomes in the examples. While some factors like employment status are strong indicators, they don't guarantee a \"YES\" outcome. The absence of any extremely high-risk factors (like living with other adults or group quarters at age 12) is also noteworthy.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, I would predict \"NO\" for this case.\n\n5. Determining confidence level:\n   Given the complexity and variability in the examples, but considering the protective factors of cohabiting and stable family environment at age 12, I'll assign a moderate confidence level: 60%.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my reasoning, I believe the prediction and confidence level are reasonable given the available information. The analysis took into account both the case-specific details and the broader patterns observed in the examples.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern of gender influencing recidivism outcomes was observed in the examples.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (cohabiting)\", \"medium\", \"Cohabiting might slightly reduce risk, but its impact is not as significant as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment status (currently unemployed)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment often correlated with 'YES' recidivism outcomes in the examples.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern was observed for household size influencing recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12 (biological mother, other parent present)\", \"medium\", \"This living arrangement seems to have a protective effect against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n</output>",
