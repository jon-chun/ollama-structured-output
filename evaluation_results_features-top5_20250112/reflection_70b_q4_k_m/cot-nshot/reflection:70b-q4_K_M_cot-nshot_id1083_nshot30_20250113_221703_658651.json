    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll follow these steps:\n\n1. Analyze the given examples to identify patterns in risk factors and their relationship with outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each identified risk factor based on its impact on recidivism.\n3. Apply the weighted risk factors to the new case provided.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nLet's begin:\n\n1. Analyzing examples:\n- Gender: No clear pattern emerges from the given examples, so it may not be a significant factor here.\n- Marital status (never married): Present in all cases; doesn't seem to correlate with outcome directly.\n- Cohabitation status: Only appears once with an outcome of YES, but sample size is too small to draw conclusions.\n- Employment history: Unemployment or fewer jobs tend to appear more often with positive recidivism outcomes.\n- Household size: Larger households (5+) are present in all cases with positive recidivism outcomes.\n- Living situation at age 12:\n  - Living with both biological parents tends to have negative outcomes less frequently.\n  - Living with only one parent or an unknown living situation appears more often with positive recidivism outcomes.\n\n2. Assigning relative weights:\n\nBased on the analysis, we can assign the following weights and reasoning:\n\na) Gender: low\n   Reasoning: No clear pattern emerges from the given examples.\n\nb) Marital status (never married): medium\n   Reasoning: Present in all cases but doesn't directly correlate with outcome; may be context-dependent.\n\nc) Cohabitation status: low\n   Reasoning: Only appears once, too small a sample size to draw conclusions.\n\nd) Employment history:\n   - Unemployment: high\n   Reasoning: Appears more frequently in positive recidivism outcomes.\n   - Fewer jobs (<3): medium\n   Reasoning: May indicate instability but not as strongly correlated as unemployment.\n\ne) Household size:\n   - 5+ household members: high\n   Reasoning: Present in all cases with positive recidivism outcomes.\n\nf) Living situation at age 12:\n   - Both biological parents: low\n   Reasoning: Tends to have negative outcomes less frequently.\n   - One parent or unknown living situation: medium\n   Reasoning: Appears more often with positive recidivism outcomes but not exclusively.\n\n3. Applying weighted risk factors to the new case:\n\n- Gender: Male (low)\n- Marital status: Never married (medium)\n- Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting (low)\n- Employment history: Currently unemployed (high)\n- Household size: 11 household members (high)\n- Living situation at age 12: Not provided\n\n4. Making a prediction:\n\nBased on the analysis and weighted risk factors, we can make an educated guess about the recidivism outcome for this case.\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our reasoning:\n- We've identified key risk factors based on the given examples.\n- We've assigned weights to each factor based on their apparent impact on outcomes.\n- The new case has several high-risk factors: unemployment and a large household size of 11.\nThese factors strongly suggest a positive recidivism outcome. However, we should also consider that the marital status (never married) and lack of cohabitation might have some mitigating effect, though their influence seems less significant based on our analysis.\n\nGiven this reflection, our prediction appears to be well-founded, but we should express moderate confidence due to the complexity of recidivism factors.\n</reflection>\n\nThe predicted outcome is YES for 3-year rearrest recidivism, with a confidence level of about 70%.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (Male)\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern emerges from given examples\"),\n    (\"Marital status (Never married)\", \"medium\", \"Present in all cases but doesn't directly correlate with outcome; may be context-dependent\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status (Not cohabiting)\", \"low\", \"Only appears once, too small a sample size to draw conclusions\"),\n    (\"Employment history (Currently unemployed)\", \"high\", \"Appears more frequently in positive recidivism outcomes\"),\n    (\"Household size (11 household members)\", \"high\", \"Present in all cases with positive recidivism outcomes\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12 (Not provided)\", \"medium\", \"May indicate potential risk but not sufficient information to determine\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
