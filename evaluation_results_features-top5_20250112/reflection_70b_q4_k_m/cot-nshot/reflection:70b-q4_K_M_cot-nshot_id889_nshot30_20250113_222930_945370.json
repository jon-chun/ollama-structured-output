    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll need to develop a step-by-step plan and use Chain of Thought reasoning. This is a high-level task that requires careful analysis of multiple factors.\n\nPlan:\n1. Analyze the given examples and identify patterns or correlations between risk factors and outcomes.\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each identified risk factor based on their impact on recidivism.\n3. Apply these weighted risk factors to the case at hand.\n4. Make a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n5. Calculate confidence in the prediction.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing examples:\n- Gender: Males seem more likely to reoffend (16/17 male cases with positive outcomes).\n- Marital status: Never married and not cohabiting seems to increase risk.\n- Employment status: Unemployment is associated with higher recidivism rates.\n- Household size: Larger households may be protective against recidivism.\n- Family structure at age 12: Living with biological parents seems protective, while living with only one parent or other adults increases risk.\n\n2. Assigning weights:\na) Gender (low): Being male slightly increases risk\nb) Marital status (medium): Never married and not cohabiting moderately increases risk\nc) Employment status (high): Unemployment significantly increases risk\nd) Household size (low): Larger households have a small protective effect\ne) Family structure at age 12 (medium): Living with only one parent or other adults moderately increases risk\n\n3. Applying to the case:\na) Gender: Male (low)\nb) Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting (medium)\nc) Employment status: Unemployed (high)\nd) Household size: 8 (low protective effect)\ne) Family structure at age 12: Living with biological mother, marital status unknown (medium)\n\n4. Prediction:\nBased on the analysis, this case has multiple risk factors for recidivism. The presence of higher-risk factors (unemployment and never married/not cohabiting) outweighs the lower-risk factors (larger household size).\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I need to consider that while larger households are generally protective, an extremely large household size like 8 may actually be a risk factor due to potential instability or lack of individual attention. This could further increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\n5. Confidence:\nGiven the presence of several significant risk factors (unemployment, never married/not cohabiting, and potentially problematic family structure at age 12), I would place high confidence in this prediction.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter final review, the analysis seems sound. The combination of unemployment, lack of stable partnership, and potentially unstable childhood environment strongly suggests an increased risk of recidivism. However, it's important to note that no single factor guarantees reoffending, and there may be other mitigating circumstances not presented in this case.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"low\", \"Being male slightly increases the risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable partnership moderately increases the risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"high\", \"Unemployment significantly increases the risk of recidivism due to potential financial instability and lack of purposeful activity\"),\n    (\"Household size: 8\", \"low\", \"While large households can be protective, an extremely large household may actually increase stress and instability, potentially increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12: Living with biological mother, marital status unknown\", \"medium\", \"This family structure moderately increases the risk of recidivism due to potential lack of male role model or stability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n\n</output>",
