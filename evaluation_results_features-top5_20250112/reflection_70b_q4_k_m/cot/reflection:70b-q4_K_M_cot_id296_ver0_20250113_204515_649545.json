    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information and assign risk factors for predicting 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify relevant factors:\n   - Gender: Male\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Living situation: Not cohabiting\n   - Employment history: Held 2 jobs\n   - Household size: 3\n   - Family background at age 12: Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown\n\n2. Assign relative weights and reasoning for each factor:\n   a) Gender (Male): Medium risk. Males are generally more likely to be rearrested than females.\n   \n   b) Marital status (Never married): High risk. Being never married is associated with higher recidivism rates.\n   \n   c) Living situation (Not cohabiting): High risk. Not having a stable partner can increase instability in life.\n   \n   d) Employment history (2 jobs): Medium risk. Having held multiple jobs may indicate some level of employability, but also potential job instability.\n   \n   e) Household size (3): Low risk. A medium-sized household might provide some stability and support.\n   \n   f) Family background at age 12: High risk. Unknown marital status of parents and living with only biological dad could indicate family instability or single-parent household.\n\n3. Summarize the findings:\n   - Risk factors: Gender, marital status, living situation, employment history, household size, and family background\n   - Weights: Medium (1), High (4), Low (1)\n\n4. Make a prediction based on the collective risk assessment:\n   Given the high number of high-risk factors (4 out of 6) and only one low-risk factor, it's likely that this person has a higher chance of rearrest within 3 years.\n\n5. Determine confidence level:\n   Based on the analysis, I would rate my confidence at 85%. The clear presence of multiple high-risk factors strongly suggests an increased likelihood of rearrest, but there is always some uncertainty in such predictions.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my analysis, it appears comprehensive and well-reasoned. However, I should note that recidivism prediction is complex and multifaceted. While these factors are significant, other unmentioned elements could influence the outcome. My confidence level of 85% reflects this understanding.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"Medium\", \"Males are generally more likely to be rearrested than females\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"High\", \"Being never married is associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Living situation: Not cohabiting\", \"High\", \"Not having a stable partner can increase instability in life\"),\n    (\"Employment history: 2 jobs\", \"Medium\", \"Having held multiple jobs may indicate some level of employability, but also potential job instability\"),\n    (\"Household size: 3\", \"Low\", \"A medium-sized household might provide some stability and support\"),\n    (\"Family background at age 12: Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown\", \"High\", \"Unknown marital status of parents and living with only biological dad could indicate family instability or single-parent household\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nThis analysis suggests that the individual has a higher likelihood of being rearrested within 3 years based on several risk factors. The most significant concerns are:\n\n1. Never having been married, which is associated with higher recidivism rates.\n2. Not cohabiting with a partner, indicating potential instability in personal life.\n3. Living with only the biological dad at age 12 (with unknown parental marital status), suggesting possible family instability.\n\nThese high-risk factors outweigh the low and medium risk elements present in this individual's profile. While there are some positive indicators, such as holding jobs and being part of a three-person household, they do not sufficiently mitigate the overall higher risk assessment.\n\nGiven the analysis, I predict that this person is likely to be rearrested within 3 years with a confidence level of 85%. This high confidence reflects the strong presence of multiple high-risk factors in their profile. However, it's important to note that recidivism prediction involves complex variables and uncertainties, which are reflected in the slightly lower than maximum confidence score.\n</output>",
