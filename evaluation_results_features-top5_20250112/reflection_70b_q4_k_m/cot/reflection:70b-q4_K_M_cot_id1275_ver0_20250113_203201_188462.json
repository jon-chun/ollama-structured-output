    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and assign a relative weight based on their impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these weighted factors to make a prediction about the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n1. Female gender\n2. Never married\n3. Not cohabiting\n4. Held only 1 job\n5. Household size: 3\n6. Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown\n\nNow, let's evaluate each factor and assign a weight:\n\n1. Gender: While gender is often not a strong predictor of recidivism on its own, research suggests that males generally have higher recidivism rates than females.\n   Weight: Low (favorable)\n\n2. Marital status (never married): Research indicates that unmarried individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates compared to married ones.\n   Weight: Medium (risk factor)\n\n3. Cohabitation status: Similar to marital status, not cohabiting can be a risk factor for recidivism as it often correlates with less stable living arrangements and social support.\n   Weight: Medium (risk factor)\n\n4. Employment history (1 job): Holding only one job could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is often associated with higher recidivism rates.\n   Weight: Medium (risk factor)\n\n5. Household size: A household size of 3 is relatively small and doesn't strongly correlate with increased risk on its own.\n   Weight: Low\n\n6. Living situation at age 12: While this information about living with the biological mother doesn't provide clear insight into current circumstances, it could hint at potential family instability in the past.\n   Weight: Low (potential risk factor)\n\n<reflection>\nAfter reviewing these factors and their assigned weights, I believe the analysis is comprehensive and based on sound criminological research. The weights seem appropriately distributed given the provided information. However, I should consider that some factors might interact or have cumulative effects when making the final prediction.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's make a collective assessment and prediction:\n\nThe person has several risk factors (never married, not cohabiting, limited job history) but also some potentially favorable factors (female gender, relatively small household size). The living situation at age 12 is somewhat ambiguous.\n\nGiven these mixed indicators, I would predict that this individual might be at moderate to high risk of rearrest within three years. However, the overall picture doesn't overwhelmingly suggest a very high likelihood of recidivism without additional factors.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, while there are several risk factors present, they don't all strongly correlate with extremely high recidivism rates on their own. The presence of some potentially favorable factors (female gender) and neutral ones (household size) balances out the picture somewhat.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll make a final prediction:\n\nPrediction: NO (not likely to be rearrested within 3 years)\nConfidence: 60%\n\nThis prediction is based on the moderate risk profile with both positive and negative factors. The confidence level reflects the uncertainty due to the mixed nature of the provided information.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"Generally lower recidivism rate compared to males\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"Research indicates higher recidivism rates for unmarried individuals\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Often correlates with less stable living arrangements and social support\"),\n    (\"Held only 1 job\", \"medium\", \"May indicate employment instability, a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size of 3\", \"low\", \"Does not strongly correlate with increased risk on its own\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown\", \"low\", \"Potential indicator of past family instability, but unclear current relevance\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n</output>",
