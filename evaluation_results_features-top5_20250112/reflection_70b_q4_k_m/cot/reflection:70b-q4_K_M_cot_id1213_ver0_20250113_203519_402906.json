    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided and assess its potential impact on recidivism risk. Then, I'll combine these factors to make a prediction about the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n1. Female gender\n2. Never married\n3. Not cohabiting\n4. Held only one job\n5. Household size of 5 at some point in her life\n6. Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n\nNow, I'll evaluate each factor and assign a relative weight:\n\n1. Female gender: Medium risk\n   Reasoning: While women generally have lower recidivism rates than men, this alone doesn't significantly decrease the overall risk.\n\n2. Never married: High risk\n   Reasoning: Lack of stable relationships can indicate instability in personal life, which may correlate with higher criminal involvement.\n\n3. Not cohabiting: Medium risk\n   Reasoning: Similar to never being married, lack of a stable partner relationship could contribute to instability but is not as significant alone.\n\n4. Held only one job: High risk\n   Reasoning: Employment stability is crucial for rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. Holding only one job suggests potential issues with maintaining employment or finding stable work.\n\n5. Household size of 5: Medium risk\n   Reasoning: While this could indicate a large family, it's not directly correlated to criminal behavior unless other factors are present.\n\n6. Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): High risk\n   Reasoning: This suggests potential instability in family dynamics or possibly single-parent household, which can be associated with higher crime rates among children.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe the analysis of each factor is sound. However, I should consider how these factors might interact. For example, never being married and not cohabiting could compound to create a higher overall risk. The presence of multiple high-risk factors (never married, held only one job, lived with biological mother at age 12) suggests that the overall risk assessment should lean towards a positive prediction for rearrest.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction:\n\nBased on the analysis, there are several significant risk factors present. The combination of never being married, holding only one job, and the potential instability suggested by living with a biological mother at age 12 (with unknown marital status) creates a substantial cumulative risk.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter considering all factors collectively, I believe the prediction should be \"YES\" for rearrest within three years. The confidence level should be around 70%, as while there are several significant risk factors, we don't have information about any previous criminal history or specific circumstances of her life beyond these points.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"medium\", \"While women generally have lower recidivism rates than men, this alone doesn't significantly decrease the overall risk.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable relationships can indicate instability in personal life, which may correlate with higher criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Similar to never being married, lack of a stable partner relationship could contribute to instability but is not as significant alone.\"),\n    (\"Held only one job\", \"high\", \"Employment stability is crucial for rehabilitation and reducing recidivism.
