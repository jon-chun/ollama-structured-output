    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign risk factors for 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant pieces of information:\n   - Female offender\n   - Married with spouse absent\n   - Held 2 jobs\n   - Household size: 4\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown\n\n2. Consider each piece of information and assign a risk factor level (low, medium, high) along with reasoning:\n\n   a) Gender: Female - Generally lower recidivism rates than males (Low)\n   b) Marital status: Married but spouse absent - Potential stress factor, but marriage can be stabilizing (Medium)\n   c) Employment history: Held 2 jobs - Indicates some stability and ability to hold employment (Low)\n   d) Household size: 4 - Moderate family responsibilities (Medium)\n   e) Childhood living situation: Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown - Potential instability in early life (High)\n\n3. Analyze the overall risk profile:\n   We have 2 low-risk factors, 2 medium-risk factors, and 1 high-risk factor.\n\n4. Make a prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism based on this analysis:\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while we have some positive factors (gender, employment history), the presence of several moderate to high risk factors (marital status, household size, childhood living situation) suggests an overall elevated risk. Therefore, I should adjust my prediction to \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\n5. Assign a confidence level:\n   Based on the mixed profile with both positive and negative indicators, I would rate the confidence at around 60%.\n\n6. Compile the final JSON response:\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female offenders generally have lower recidivism rates than male offenders\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Being married can be stabilizing, but spouse absence may introduce stress and instability\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding 2 jobs indicates some stability and ability to maintain employment\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium\", \"A household of 4 presents moderate family responsibilities that could contribute to stress or financial strain\"),\n    (\"Childhood living situation\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother at age 12, with an unknown marital status, may indicate early life instability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n</output>",
