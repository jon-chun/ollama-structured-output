    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to carefully consider each factor mentioned in the scenario and assess its potential impact on recidivism risk. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Identify the given factors:\n   - Gender: Female\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\n   - Employment history: Held 2 jobs\n   - Household size: 6\n\n2. Analyze each factor and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) along with reasoning:\n   - Gender: Generally considered low risk; women have lower recidivism rates than men.\n   - Marital status: Never married could be slightly higher risk due to potential lack of stability.\n   - Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting might indicate less social support or stability.\n   - Employment history: Holding 2 jobs suggests some employment stability but not long-term job retention.\n   - Household size: Large household (6) may indicate more stressors and less individual attention.\n\n3. Combine these factors to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n   - The presence of both positive and negative factors suggests an overall moderate risk.\n\n4. Assign confidence level for the prediction:\n   - Based on the mixed nature of the factors, I'll choose a moderate confidence level (60%).\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive, but I should consider how these factors might interact with each other. For instance, while being never married and not cohabiting individually may increase risk, together they could amplify that effect. Additionally, holding 2 jobs in a large household might indicate resilience or ability to multitask, potentially lowering the overall risk.\n</reflection>\n\nLet me adjust my analysis based on this reflection:\n\n- Gender: Low risk\n- Marital status & Cohabitation: Medium-high risk (combined effect)\n- Employment history: Medium risk\n- Household size: Medium risk\n\nWith these adjustments in mind, here's the final JSON response:\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Marital status & Cohabitation\", \"medium-high\", \"Being never married and not cohabiting may indicate lack of social support or stability, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding 2 jobs suggests some employment stability but lacks long-term job retention, indicating moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium\", \"A large household (6) may create more stressors and less individual attention, contributing to a moderate level of risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis JSON object presents the analysis of each risk factor for a female who is never married, not cohabiting, has held 2 jobs, and lives in a household of 6. Based on these factors, the prediction is that she will not be rearrested within 3 years.\n\nThe risk factors are assessed as follows:\n1. Gender: Low risk - Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n2. Marital status & Cohabitation: Medium-high risk - Being never married and not cohabiting may indicate lack of social support or stability, potentially increasing risk.\n3. Employment history: Medium risk - Holding 2 jobs suggests some employment stability but lacks long-term job retention, indicating moderate risk.\n4. Household size: Medium risk - A large household (6) may create more stressors and less individual attention, contributing to a moderate level of risk.\n\nThe overall prediction is \"NO\" because while there are some factors that could increase the risk of recidivism (marital status, cohabitation status, and large household), they are balanced by positive factors such as being female and having some employment history. The confidence in this prediction is 60%, indicating a moderate level of certainty.\n\n</output>",
