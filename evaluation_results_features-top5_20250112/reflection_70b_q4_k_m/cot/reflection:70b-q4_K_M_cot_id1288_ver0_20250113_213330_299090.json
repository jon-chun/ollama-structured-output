    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given information and assess each risk factor. Then, I'll use these assessments to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors from the given information.\n2. Assess each risk factor (marital status, cohabitation, employment history, household size, and family structure at age 12).\n3. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on its potential impact on recidivism.\n4. Summarize the reasoning for each risk factor assessment.\n5. Based on the overall picture of risk factors, make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n6. Estimate confidence in this prediction.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n1. Risk factors:\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Cohabitation (not cohabiting)\n   - Employment history (held 1 job)\n   - Household size (4)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (lived with biological mother, other parent present)\n\n2-3. Assessing and weighting each risk factor:\n\na) Marital status: Never married\nWeight: Medium\nReasoning: Lack of stable long-term relationships can indicate instability but not a strong indicator alone.\n\nb) Cohabitation: Not cohabiting\nWeight: Low\nReasoning: Similar to marital status, lack of cohabitation indicates potential instability but is not a strong risk factor on its own.\n\nc) Employment history: Held 1 job\nWeight: Medium-High\nReasoning: Limited work experience and potentially unstable employment can be a significant indicator of recidivism risk.\n\nd) Household size: 4\nWeight: Low-Medium\nReasoning: A larger household may indicate more support, but could also suggest potential instability or financial stress.\n\ne) Family structure at age 12: Lived with biological mother, other parent present\nWeight: High\nReasoning: A stable family environment can significantly reduce recidivism risk. This factor indicates a relatively stable upbringing.\n\n4. Summarizing reasoning:\nAll factors have been assessed and weighted based on their potential impact on recidivism risk.\n\n5. Making a prediction:\nConsidering the mix of medium to high-risk factors (limited employment, never married) against the strong protective factor of a stable family environment, I would predict \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n6. Estimating confidence:\nBased on this analysis, I would estimate a confidence level of about 70%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the assessment seems reasonable but could be improved by considering potential interactions between factors and their cumulative effect. The family structure factor may have a stronger mitigating impact than initially considered, potentially reducing overall risk more significantly.\n</reflection>\n\nAfter this reflection, I'm confident in the prediction but would slightly adjust the confidence level to 75%.\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable long-term relationships can indicate instability but is not a strong indicator alone.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation: Not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"Similar to marital status, lack of cohabitation indicates potential instability but is not a strong risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Employment history: Held 1 job\", \"medium-high\", \"Limited work experience and potentially unstable employment can be a significant indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"low-medium\", \"A larger household may indicate more support, but could also suggest potential instability or financial stress.\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12: Lived with biological mother, other parent present\", \"high\", \"A stable family environment can significantly reduce recidivism risk.
