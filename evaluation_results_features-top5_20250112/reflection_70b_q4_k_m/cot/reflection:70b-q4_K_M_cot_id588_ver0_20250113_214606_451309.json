    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze each risk factor provided, assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) based on its potential impact on recidivism risk, and then use these factors to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each given factor:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held 5 jobs\n   - Household size of 2\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assign relative weight to each factor based on its potential impact on recidivism risk\n\n3. Summarize the reasoning for each factor's assigned weight\n\n4. Use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism\n\n5. Estimate confidence in the prediction\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyzing the factors:\n   - Male gender: Generally considered a moderate risk factor\n   - Never married: Could be low or medium, as it might indicate instability but also lack of family ties to crime\n   - Not cohabiting: Similar to never married, could be low to medium risk\n   - Held 5 jobs: This is a significant indicator of instability and potentially high risk\n   - Household size of 2: Generally not considered a strong risk factor\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): Could indicate family instability, moderate risk\n\n2. Assigning weights:\n   - Male gender: Medium\n   - Never married: Low to medium\n   - Not cohabiting: Low to medium\n   - Held 5 jobs: High\n   - Household size of 2: Low\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): Medium\n\n3. Reasoning:\n   Male gender is generally associated with higher crime rates, but it's not the strongest predictor.\n   Never married and not cohabiting suggest some instability but don't necessarily point to criminal behavior.\n   Holding five jobs in a short period indicates significant life instability and potentially poor decision-making skills, which are strongly linked to recidivism risk.\n   Household size is generally not considered a strong risk factor for crime or recidivism.\n   Living with one's biological mother at age 12 without knowledge of marital status could indicate family issues but isn't as clear-cut as other factors.\n\n4. Collective prediction:\nBased on these factors, particularly the job instability and male gender, there appears to be a moderate to high risk of rearrest within three years.\n\n5. Confidence estimation:\nGiven the information provided, I would estimate my confidence in this prediction at about 70-80%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. The assignment of weights is based on established criminological research. However, it's important to note that real-world predictions would require more factors and possibly more nuanced weightings. Also, the confidence level might be slightly optimistic given the limited information provided.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"Medium\", \"Generally associated with higher crime rates but not the strongest predictor\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"Low to Medium\", \"Indicates some instability but doesn't necessarily point to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"Low to Medium\", \"Similar to never married, suggests some life instability without strong evidence of criminal predisposition\"),\n    (\"Held 5 jobs\", \"High\", \"Significant indicator of life instability and potentially poor decision-making skills strongly linked to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Household size of 2\", \"Low\", \"Generally not considered a strong risk factor for crime or recidivism\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\", \"Medium\", \"Could indicate family instability, but not as clear-cut as other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n</output>",
