    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each risk factor and assign a weight, then use these factors to make an overall prediction. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyze each given factor:\n   - Gender: Female\n   - Marital status: Never married, cohabiting\n   - Employment history: Held 1 job\n   - Household size: 4\n   - Family structure at age 12: Lived with both biological parents\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each factor (low, medium, high) and provide reasoning:\n   \n   a) Gender: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: While gender is not a strong predictor on its own, females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\n\n   b) Marital status: Low-Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Being never married but cohabiting could indicate some stability in life.\n\n   c) Employment history: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Holding only one job may suggest limited work experience or instability, which is a moderate risk factor.\n\n   d) Household size: Low risk\n      Reasoning: A larger household (4 members) might provide more support and less isolation, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\n\n   e) Family structure at age 12: Low risk\n      Reasoning: Living with both biological parents at age 12 suggests a stable family environment during childhood.\n\n3. Consider the overall picture:\n   Most factors suggest low to medium risk, but there are some mixed indicators.\n\n4. Make a prediction and estimate confidence:\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, while most individual factors indicate low risk, the overall profile doesn't strongly lean towards either high or very low risk. The presence of both biological parents at age 12 is particularly positive. Given this balanced view, I'll predict \"NO\" for recidivism within 3 years. Confidence should be moderate to high due to the generally positive indicators.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis and reflection, here's the JSON output:\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"Medium\", \"Female gender is associated with lower recidivism rates than males but is not a strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"Low-Medium\", \"Never married but cohabiting may indicate some stability in life, though it's not as secure as being married.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"Medium\", \"Holding only one job suggests limited work experience or instability, which is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"Low\", \"A larger household provides more support and less isolation, potentially reducing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12\", \"Low\", \"Living with both biological parents during childhood indicates a stable family environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n</output>",
