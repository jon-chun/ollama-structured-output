    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information, assess each factor's risk level, and then make a prediction about the likelihood of rearrest within 3 years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Currently unemployed\n   - Household size of 11\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each factor:\n   a) Male gender: This is generally considered a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\n   b) Never married: Studies often show unmarried individuals have higher rates of recidivism, so this could be high risk.\n   c) Not cohabiting: Similar to never married, lack of stable relationships can increase risk, potentially medium to high.\n   d) Currently unemployed: Unemployment is a well-documented risk factor for recidivism, likely high risk.\n   e) Household size of 11: This is an unusual and potentially destabilizing factor, possibly medium to high risk.\n\n3. Consider the overall profile:\n   - Multiple factors indicating instability (unmarried, not cohabiting, unemployment)\n   - Potential lack of support system or stable environment\n   - Large household size could add stress and instability\n\n4. Make a prediction based on these factors:\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while multiple factors indicate potential instability, we don't have information about the individual's criminal history or past behavior. These are crucial factors in recidivism predictions. Without this context, it might be premature to make a definitive prediction of rearrest within 3 years.\n\nHowever, given the constraints of the task and the need to provide a response, I'll proceed with caution. The presence of several risk factors suggests that this individual might have a higher likelihood of rearrest compared to someone with more stable life circumstances.\n</reflection>\n\n5. Assign confidence level:\n   Given the incomplete information (lack of criminal history), I should express moderate confidence in any prediction.\n\nNow, let's formulate the JSON response:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"Generally associated with higher crime rates and recidivism\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable long-term relationships may increase instability\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium-high\", \"Similar to never married, suggests lack of current stable relationship\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"high\", \"Well-documented risk factor for recidivism and crime\"),\n    (\"Household size of 11\", \"medium-high\", \"Potentially destabilizing environment\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n<reflection>\nFinal reflection: The prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest within 3 years is based on the cumulative effect of several risk factors. However, it's crucial to note that this assessment lacks critical information about the individual's criminal history and personal circumstances. In real-world scenarios, such predictions would require more comprehensive data and careful consideration of all relevant factors.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"Generally associated with higher crime rates and recidivism\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable long-term relationships may increase instability\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium-high\", \"Similar to never married, suggests lack of current stable relationship\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"high\", \"Well-documented risk factor for recidivism and crime\"),\n    (\"Household size of 11\", \"medium-high\", \"Potentially destabilizing environment\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
