    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each risk factor, assign a relative weight (low, medium, high), and then use these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each piece of information:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held only 1 job\n   - Household size of 5\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assign a relative weight to each factor and provide reasoning:\n\n   a) Male gender: Medium risk, as males have higher recidivism rates than females.\n   b) Never married: High risk, as lack of stable relationships can indicate instability in life.\n   c) Not cohabiting: High risk, similar to never being married, it may indicate social isolation or inability to maintain long-term relationships.\n   d) Held only 1 job: Medium risk, as this could indicate employment issues but also potential stability.\n   e) Household size of 5: Low risk, larger households can provide more support and stability.\n   f) Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): Medium risk, as the marital status being unknown may indicate an unstable home environment.\n\n3. Collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n   Based on these factors, there are several concerning signs of instability in relationships and employment. However, some potentially mitigating factors exist, such as living with a biological parent at age 12 (which could provide stability) and having a larger household size.\n\n4. Determine the final prediction:\n   Given the mixed signals but overall leaning towards higher risk factors, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n5. Estimate confidence level:\n   The confidence should be moderate to high given the presence of several significant risk factors, but not extremely high as there are some potentially mitigating circumstances.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my analysis, I believe it's comprehensive and addresses all provided information. The reasoning for each factor seems sound, and the final prediction aligns with the overall assessment of risk factors. However, I should note that without specific data on recidivism rates associated with these factors or more detailed context about the individual's past offenses, this prediction is based on general principles of criminology.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable relationships can indicate instability in life, which is often associated with increased criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"high\", \"Similar to never being married, this may indicate social isolation or inability to maintain long-term relationships, potentially increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Held only 1 job\", \"medium\", \"While this could be seen as a sign of employment stability, it's also concerning given that most people have had multiple jobs by adulthood.
