    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each factor given in the scenario and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) based on its impact on recidivism risk. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Female\n2. Never married\n3. Not cohabiting\n4. Held 2 jobs\n5. Household size of 4\n6. Lived with both biological parents at age 12\n\nNow, let's analyze each factor and assign a weight along with reasoning:\n\n1. Gender (Female): Medium - Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\n2. Marital status (Never married): High - Unmarried individuals may face more social instability.\n3. Cohabitation status (Not cohabiting): Medium - Similar to marital status, but less severe impact.\n4. Employment history (Held 2 jobs): Low - Indicates some stability in employment.\n5. Household size (4): Medium - Larger household can indicate more stress and potential instability.\n6. Family structure at age 12 (Both biological parents present): Low - Stable family background is generally a positive factor.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter reviewing these factors, I believe the analysis is comprehensive and based on general criminological principles. However, it's important to note that individual circumstances can vary greatly, and this assessment should be taken as a probability rather than certainty.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's use these weighted factors collectively to make a prediction:\n\nPrediction: NO (the individual is less likely to recidivate)\nConfidence: 80%\n\nReasoning for the prediction:\nWhile there are some risk factors present (marital status, cohabitation status), they are balanced by positive factors (gender, employment history, family structure). The overall profile suggests a relatively low risk of recidivism.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Female\", \"Medium\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"High\", \"Unmarried individuals may face more social instability.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\", \"Medium\", \"Similar to marital status, but less severe impact.\"),\n    (\"Employment history: Held 2 jobs\", \"Low\", \"Indicates some stability in employment.\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"Medium\", \"Larger household can indicate more stress and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12: Both biological parents present\", \"Low\", \"Stable family background is generally a positive factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis assessment takes into account various factors that could influence the likelihood of recidivism. The individual's gender, employment history, and stable family background at age 12 are positive indicators suggesting lower risk. However, their marital status and household size introduce some level of uncertainty and potential instability.\n\nThe overall profile suggests that while there are some risk factors present, they are balanced by more favorable characteristics. This leads to a prediction of \"NO\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with an 80% confidence level. It's important to note that individual circumstances can vary greatly, and this assessment should be taken as a probability rather than certainty.\n\n</output>",
