    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given information, assign weights to each risk factor, and then use these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors from the given information:\n   - Gender (female)\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Cohabitation status\n   - Employment history (4 jobs held)\n   - Household size (3)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor:\n   - Gender: low\n   - Marital status: medium\n   - Cohabitation status: low\n   - Employment history: medium\n   - Household size: low\n   - Family structure at age 12: high\n\n3. Provide textual reasoning for each risk factor's weight assignment:\n\n4. Use these weighted factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n   Based on the analysis, I would predict \"YES\" for rearrest within 3 years.\n\n5. Estimate confidence level (0-100):\n   Given the available information and assigned weights, I'd estimate a moderate to high confidence in this prediction, around 70%.\n\n<reflection>\nLet me review my reasoning:\n1. All relevant factors have been identified.\n2. The weight assignments seem appropriate based on general criminological knowledge.\n3. Reasoning for each factor is provided.\n4. The prediction is made based on the analysis.\n5. Confidence level is estimated.\n\nThe plan and execution appear to be comprehensive and logical. However, I should consider adding more specific reasoning for why family structure at age 12 was given a high weight, as this may not be immediately clear to non-experts.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Female\", \"low\", \"While gender can play a role in criminal behavior, being female is generally considered a lower risk factor compared to other demographic characteristics.\"),\n    (\"Never Married\", \"medium\", \"Marital status can influence stability and social connections. Never having been married may indicate less stable relationships or fewer social bonds, which could increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting\", \"low\", \"Living with a partner can provide some level of stability, but it's not as strong an indicator as legal marriage. In this case, it slightly offsets the risk of never having been married.\"),\n    (\"4 Jobs Held\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could contribute to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Household Size: 3\", \"low\", \"A household size of three is relatively average and doesn't strongly indicate either increased or decreased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Structure at Age 12: Lived with Biological Mother, Marital Status Unknown\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a potentially unstable family environment (unknown marital status of mother) can significantly impact an individual's life trajectory and increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis assessment takes into account various demographic and lifestyle factors that have been associated with recidivism risk. The prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest within 3 years is based on a combination of factors, particularly the individual's unstable employment history and potentially challenging family background.\n\nThe gender factor (female) contributes to a lower overall risk, while never having been married and frequent job changes increase the likelihood of recidivism. Cohabiting slightly mitigates some risks associated with being unmarried. The household size is neutral in this assessment.\n\nThe high weight assigned to family structure at age 12 reflects research suggesting that unstable childhood environments can significantly impact an individual's future behavior, including increased risk of criminal activity and recidivism. This factor carries considerable weight in the overall prediction.\n\nGiven these factors, the confidence level for this prediction is estimated at 70%, indicating a moderate to high likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n</output>",
