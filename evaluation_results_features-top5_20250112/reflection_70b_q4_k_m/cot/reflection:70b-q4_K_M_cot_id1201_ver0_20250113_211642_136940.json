    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given information about the individual's background and assign risk factors for rearrest recidivism. Then, based on these factors, I'll make a prediction about whether she will be rearrested within three years.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant pieces of information:\n   - Female\n   - Never married\n   - Cohabiting\n   - Held 3 jobs\n   - Household size: 3\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assign risk factors and their weights:\n   a) Gender: Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males.\n   b) Marital status: Being never married might be a moderate risk factor.\n   c) Cohabitation status: Could be neutral or slightly positive.\n   d) Employment history: Three jobs might indicate some instability.\n   e) Household size: A household of three is relatively small, potentially less stressful.\n   f) Family background: Living with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown) could have mixed effects.\n\n3. Evaluate each factor's weight:\n   a) Gender: Low risk\n   b) Marital status: Medium risk\n   c) Cohabitation status: Low risk\n   d) Employment history: Medium risk\n   e) Household size: Low risk\n   f) Family background: Medium risk\n\n4. Consider the overall picture and make a prediction:\n   The individual has some potential positive factors (gender, household size) but also several moderate-risk factors.\n\n5. Determine confidence level:\n   Based on the mixed factors, I'll assign a moderate to low confidence in the prediction.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive. However, it might be beneficial to consider the lack of information about criminal history or any current charges. In real-world risk assessments, this would be crucial information. Given the limitations of the data provided, we must make do with what's available and acknowledge that our confidence in the prediction should be lower than usual due to incomplete information.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender generally associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, which might indicate less stability or support system\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"low\", \"Being in a cohabiting relationship could provide some stability and support\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Three jobs may suggest employment instability but also indicates effort to work\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"A household of three is relatively small, potentially less stressful\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown, could have mixed effects on stability and support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
