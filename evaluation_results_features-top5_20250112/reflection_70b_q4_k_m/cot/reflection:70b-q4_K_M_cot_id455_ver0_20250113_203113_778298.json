    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each factor separately and then combine them for the prediction. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors from the given information:\n   - Gender (female)\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Cohabitation status (cohabiting)\n   - Employment history (3 jobs held)\n   - Household size (6 people)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (lived with both biological parents)\n\n2. Assign a relative weight to each factor:\n   - Gender: low\n   - Marital status: medium\n   - Cohabitation status: low\n   - Employment history: high\n   - Household size: high\n   - Family structure at age 12: medium\n\n3. Reason through each factor's weight assignment:\n\n   a) Gender (low): While gender can play a role in crime and recidivism, it is generally considered less predictive compared to other factors.\n   \n   b) Marital status (medium): Being never married can be associated with higher risk of recidivism, but it's not as strong a predictor as some other factors.\n   \n   c) Cohabitation status (low): Cohabiting is often seen as a stabilizing factor, potentially reducing the risk of recidivism. However, its impact may be less significant compared to other factors in this case.\n   \n   d) Employment history (high): Holding multiple jobs can indicate instability and difficulty maintaining employment, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\n   \n   e) Household size (high): A large household size can create financial strain and social stressors that may increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n   \n   f) Family structure at age 12 (medium): Living with both biological parents can be a protective factor, potentially reducing the risk of future criminal behavior. However, its impact may vary depending on other factors.\n\n4. Combine these factors to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n   Given the high-risk factors (employment history and household size) outweighing the medium-to-low risk factors, I would predict \"YES\" for recidivism within 3 years.\n   \n5. Assign confidence level: Based on this analysis, I would assign a moderate to high confidence level of 75%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive, but I should double-check if I've missed any important considerations:\n1. The combination of low-risk factors (gender and cohabitation) against the higher-risk factors is balanced.\n2. The medium-risk factors (marital status and family structure at age 12) provide additional context but don't outweigh the high-risk factors.\n\nThe prediction of \"YES\" for recidivism within 3 years, with a confidence level of 75%, appears justified based on this analysis. However, I should note that real-world criminal risk assessment would require more detailed information and potentially other factors not mentioned here.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's formulate the output JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (female)\", \"low\", \"While gender can play a role in crime and recidivism, it is generally considered less predictive compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"Being never married can be associated with higher risk of recidivism, but it's not as strong a predictor as some other factors.\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting\", \"low\", \"Cohabiting is often seen as a stabilizing factor, potentially reducing the risk of recidivism.
