    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to carefully evaluate each risk factor mentioned and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) based on their potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these weighted factors to make a prediction about the likelihood of rearrest within 3 years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors:\n   - Gender: Male\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\n   - Employment history: Held 2 jobs\n   - Household size: 5\n   - Living situation at age 12: With biological mother, marital status unknown\n\n2. Evaluate each risk factor:\n   a) Gender (Male): Typically associated with higher recidivism rates in many studies.\n      Weight: Medium to High\n\n   b) Marital status (Never married): Often considered a moderate risk factor.\n      Weight: Medium\n\n   c) Cohabitation status (Not cohabiting): Similar to marital status, a moderate risk.\n      Weight: Medium\n\n   d) Employment history (2 jobs): Indicates some employment instability, but not extreme.\n      Weight: Low to Medium\n\n   e) Household size (5): Large households can be associated with increased stress and chaos.\n      Weight: Medium\n\n   f) Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, marital status unknown):\n      This factor is less clear in terms of recidivism risk. It may indicate some family instability but not necessarily a strong predictor on its own.\n      Weight: Low\n\n3. Compile the weighted risk factors:\n   \n4. Use these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n   Based on the overall profile, there are several moderate and one high-risk factor (gender). The employment history is relatively stable compared to other factors.\n\n5. Assign a confidence level for the prediction:\n   Given that we have more than half of the factors as medium risk or higher, but not all are strongly indicative of recidivism, I would rate the confidence in this prediction around 70%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive and balanced. However, it might be beneficial to consider a slight adjustment in the employment history factor from \"Low\" to \"Medium\". While two jobs is not extreme instability, in many criminal justice contexts, this could still be seen as somewhat unstable compared to longer-term job retention.\n\nLet's adjust that one factor:\n   d) Employment history (2 jobs): Indicates some employment instability.\n      Weight: Medium\n\nThis adjustment should provide a more accurate representation of the risk factors involved.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"High\", \"Males are generally associated with higher recidivism rates in criminal justice research.\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"Medium\", \"Being never married is often considered a moderate risk factor for recidivism, indicating potential lack of stable family ties.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\", \"Medium\", \"Similar to marital status, not cohabiting can be associated with a higher risk of recidivism due to lack of stable relationships.\"),\n    (\"Employment history: 2 jobs\", \"Medium\", \"While this indicates some employment stability, having held only two jobs may suggest potential difficulties in long-term job retention or career advancement.\"),\n    (\"Household size: 5\", \"Medium\", \"Large households can be associated with increased stress and chaotic living environments, potentially contributing to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: With biological mother, marital status unknown\", \"Low\", \"This factor provides less clear evidence of recidivism risk. While it may indicate some family instability, its impact on adult criminal behavior is less direct.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
