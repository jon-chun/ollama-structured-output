    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information and assign risk factors for rearrest recidivism within a three-year period. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify potential risk factors:\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Living situation (not cohabiting)\n   - Employment history (2 jobs)\n   - Household size (6)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (both biological parents)\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each factor:\n   a) Never married: medium risk\n   b) Not cohabiting: low risk\n   c) Held 2 jobs: medium risk\n   d) Household size of 6: high risk\n   e) Lived with both biological parents at age 12: low risk\n\n3. Justify each assignment:\n   a) Never married (medium): Being single can be a moderate predictor of recidivism, as it may indicate instability or lack of social support.\n   b) Not cohabiting (low): This factor alone doesn't strongly correlate with criminal behavior, but could contribute to overall risk if combined with other factors.\n   c) Held 2 jobs (medium): Job instability is often associated with higher recidivism rates.\n   d) Household size of 6 (high): Large households can indicate financial strain or chaotic living conditions, which may increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n   e) Lived with both biological parents at age 12 (low): Stable family structure in childhood is generally a protective factor against later criminal involvement.\n\n4. Collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n    Based on these factors, especially considering the high risk associated with the large household size and the medium risks from marital status and job instability, I would lean towards predicting YES for rearrest within three years.\n    Confidence level: 75%\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive. However, we should consider that never having been married might be more strongly correlated with recidivism than initially assessed. Many studies show that being married is a significant protective factor against crime and recidivism.\n\nLet's adjust the risk assessment for marital status to high:\na) Never married (high): Being single, especially if it continues through adulthood, can be a strong predictor of criminal involvement due to lack of social bonding and support.\n</reflection>\n\nAfter this reflection, let's finalize our analysis:\n\nFinal Risk Assessment:\na) Never married: high\nb) Not cohabiting: low\nc) Held 2 jobs: medium\nd) Household size of 6: high\ne) Lived with both biological parents at age 12: low\n\nCollective Prediction:\nYES (rearrest within three years)\nConfidence: 80%\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Being single, especially if it continues through adulthood, can be a strong predictor of criminal involvement due to lack of social bonding and support.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"This factor alone doesn't strongly correlate with criminal behavior, but could contribute to overall risk if combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"Held 2 jobs\", \"medium\", \"Job instability is often associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 6\", \"high\", \"Large households can indicate financial strain or chaotic living conditions, which may increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Lived with both biological parents at age 12\", \"low\", \"Stable family structure in childhood is generally a protective factor against later criminal involvement.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
