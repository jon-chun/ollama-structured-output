    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given information and assign a risk factor weight for each piece of data. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict the likelihood of rearrest recidivism within three years.\n\nStep 1: Analyze each piece of information and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) along with reasoning:\n\n1. Gender: Female\n   Weight: Low\n   Reasoning: Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n\n2. Marital status: Never married\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Lack of stable relationships may indicate instability or lack of support systems.\n\n3. Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Living alone can increase stress and reduce social support, potentially increasing risk.\n\n4. Employment history: Held 2 jobs\n   Weight: High\n   Reasoning: Frequent job changes may indicate instability or lack of commitment to employment.\n\n5. Household size: 4\n   Weight: Low\n   Reasoning: A larger household can provide more support and stability.\n\n6. Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Uncertainty about parental relationship may indicate family instability.\n\nStep 2: Collectively analyze the risk factors to predict rearrest recidivism within three years:\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing my analysis, I believe it's comprehensive and takes into account all provided information. However, I should consider that while we have various factors, none of them strongly indicate a high likelihood of recidivism based on the given data alone.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, the prediction seems to lean towards not predicting rearrest recidivism.\n\nStep 3: Determine the confidence level:\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering the mixed bag of risk factors and the lack of any strong indicators for recidivism, I should assign a moderate to high confidence level. This reflects that while we have some information, it's not overwhelmingly clear-cut in either direction.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's compile all this into the required JSON format:\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Female\", \"Low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"Medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships may indicate instability or lack of support systems.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress and reduce social support, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment history: Held 2 jobs\", \"High\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability or lack of commitment to employment.\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"Low\", \"A larger household can provide more support and stability.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown\", \"Medium\", \"Uncertainty about parental relationship may indicate family instability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n</output>",
