    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given information and assess various risk factors related to recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify relevant risk factors from the given information\n2. Evaluate each factor's impact on recidivism\n3. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor\n4. Consider how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism\n5. Make a prediction and assign confidence level\n\nLet's go through the analysis:\n\n1. Relevant risk factors:\n   - Gender (female)\n   - Marital status (married with spouse present)\n   - Employment history (held 1 job)\n   - Household size (3)\n   - Family background at age 12 (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Evaluating each factor's impact:\n\na) Gender: Being female typically reduces recidivism risk\nb) Marital status: Stable marriage often decreases recidivism risk\nc) Employment history: Limited job experience may increase instability and risk\nd) Household size: Moderate-sized household can be neutral or slightly positive\ne) Family background at 12: Unknown marital status of caregiver could indicate instability\n\n3. Assigning relative weights:\n\na) Gender: Low (favorable factor)\nb) Marital status: High (strong protective factor)\nc) Employment history: Medium (potential risk, but not strongly predictive on its own)\nd) Household size: Low (neutral to slightly positive factor)\ne) Family background at 12: Medium (potential risk due to unknown caregiver's marital status)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I should also consider the interaction between these factors and their overall impact. The stable marriage and female gender are strong protective factors against recidivism, which might outweigh the potential risks from limited job experience and unknown family dynamics at a young age.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Collective prediction:\nGiven the information, the overall picture suggests a low to moderate risk of recidivism.\n\n5. Prediction and confidence level:\nBased on this analysis, I predict that the individual is unlikely to be rearrested within 3 years (NO).\n\nConfidence level: 80% (this accounts for some uncertainty due to limited information)\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Being female typically reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \"Stable marriage often decreases recidivism risk significantly\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Limited job experience may increase instability and risk, but is not strongly predictive on its own\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Moderate-sized household can be neutral or slightly positive factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family background at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Unknown marital status of caregiver could indicate early life instability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
