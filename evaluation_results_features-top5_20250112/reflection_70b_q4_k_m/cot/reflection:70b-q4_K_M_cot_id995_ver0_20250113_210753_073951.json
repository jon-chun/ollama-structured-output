    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information, assign weights to each risk factor, and then make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Cohabiting\n   - Held 3 jobs\n   - Household size of 3\n   - Lived with biological dad at age 12\n   - Marital status unknown at age 12\n\n2. Assign weights to each factor based on their potential impact on recidivism:\n   a) Male gender: Medium risk (males are generally more likely to commit crimes)\n   b) Never married: High risk (lack of stable family structure)\n   c) Cohabiting: Low risk (some stability, but not as strong as marriage)\n   d) Held 3 jobs: Medium risk (job instability, but some employment history)\n   e) Household size of 3: Low risk (suggests some social support)\n   f) Lived with biological dad at age 12: Medium risk (stable family structure in childhood)\n   g) Marital status unknown at age 12: High risk (potential lack of parental stability)\n\n3. Analyze the overall risk profile:\n   - The subject has a mix of positive and negative factors.\n   - Negative factors seem to outweigh positive ones.\n\n4. Make a prediction based on the analysis:\n   Given the balance of high-risk factors, I predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n5. Determine confidence level:\n   Based on the mixed but predominantly negative profile, I'll assign a moderate confidence level: 60%\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. However, I should consider that never being married might be less of a risk factor in modern society where cohabitation is more common. Additionally, holding three jobs could indicate adaptability rather than instability. These factors might balance out some of the higher-risk elements.\n</reflection>\n\nGiven this reflection, I'll adjust my assessment slightly:\n\na) Never married: Medium risk (not as strongly correlated with recidivism in modern society)\nb) Held 3 jobs: Low risk (potential for adaptability and job seeking skills)\n\nThis adjustment doesn't change the overall prediction but might increase confidence.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"Generally associated with higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"Lack of traditional stable family structure, though less correlated in modern society\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting\", \"low\", \"Some level of relationship stability, though not as strong as marriage\"),\n    (\"Held 3 jobs\", \"low\", \"Indicates job seeking skills and adaptability, potentially positive for recidivism prevention\"),\n    (\"Household size of 3\", \"low\", \"Suggests some social support and stable living environment\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological dad at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Indicates stable family structure in childhood\"),\n    (\"Marital status unknown at age 12\", \"high\", \"Potential lack of parental stability or inconsistent family structure\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\n</output>",
