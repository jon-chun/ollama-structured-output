    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information and assign a risk factor for each piece of data. Then, I'll use these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each piece of information:\n   - Female gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held 3 jobs\n   - Household size of 2\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown\n\n2. Assign risk factors and reasoning for each:\n\n   a) Gender: Low risk (Generally, women have lower recidivism rates than men)\n   \n   b) Marital status: High risk (Never married individuals may lack stable family support)\n   \n   c) Cohabitation status: Medium risk (Not cohabiting could indicate unstable relationships or living situations)\n   \n   d) Job history: Low risk (Holding 3 jobs suggests some stability and employability)\n   \n   e) Household size: Low risk (Small household size might indicate fewer stressors)\n   \n   f) Childhood living situation: High risk (Living with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown, may indicate unstable childhood)\n\n3. Summarize the factors:\n   - 2 low-risk factors\n   - 1 medium-risk factor\n   - 3 high-risk factors\n\n4. Make a prediction based on these factors:\n   Given that there are more high-risk factors than low or medium risk ones, and considering the importance of marital status and childhood living situation in recidivism studies, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n\n5. Determine confidence level:\n   The presence of both positive (job history) and negative (marital status, cohabitation status, childhood living situation) factors means there's some uncertainty. However, the balance tips towards a higher risk scenario.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe my analysis is comprehensive. I've considered all provided information and assigned risk levels based on common criminological factors. The prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism seems justified given the preponderance of high-risk factors. However, I should emphasize that this is a relatively lower-confidence prediction due to the presence of contradictory factors.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates than male gender.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \"Being never married often correlates with a higher risk of recidivism due to lack of stable family support and potential social isolation.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"medium\", \"Not cohabiting could indicate unstable relationships or living situations, but its impact is less clear-cut than marital status.\"),\n    (\"Job history\", \"low\", \"Holding multiple jobs suggests employability and some stability in life, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"A smaller household size might indicate fewer stressors and more manageable living conditions, which could lower the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Childhood living situation\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother at age 12 with unknown marital status may indicate an unstable childhood environment, often associated with higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis assessment takes into account various factors related to the individual's background and living situation. While there are some positive indicators such as job history and gender, these are outweighed by several high-risk factors including marital status, cohabitation status, and childhood living situation.\n\nThe prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism within three years is based on the preponderance of high-risk factors over low-risk ones. However, it's important to note that this assessment has a moderate level of confidence (60%) due to the presence of contradictory factors in the individual's profile.\n\n</output>",
