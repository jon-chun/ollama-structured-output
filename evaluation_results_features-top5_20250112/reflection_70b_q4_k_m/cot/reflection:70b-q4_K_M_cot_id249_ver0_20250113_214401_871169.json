    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each risk factor, assign a relative weight (low, medium, high), and then use these factors to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each given factor:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held 3 jobs\n   - Household size of 4\n   - Lived with both biological parents at age 12\n\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its impact on recidivism risk:\n\n   a. Male gender: High (Males are generally at higher risk for criminal behavior)\n   b. Never married: Medium (Lack of stable relationships can increase risk)\n   c. Not cohabiting: Medium (Similar to never married, lack of stable partnership)\n   d. Held 3 jobs: Low (Job instability is a moderate risk factor)\n   e. Household size of 4: Low (Large households are generally less risky)\n   f. Lived with both biological parents at age 12: Low (Stable family environment decreases risk)\n\n3. Reason through each factor:\n   - Male gender: Males are consistently shown to have higher rates of criminal behavior and recidivism.\n   - Never married & Not cohabiting: Both indicate a lack of stable long-term relationships, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n   - Held 3 jobs: While job instability is generally a risk factor, holding multiple jobs might also indicate adaptability and employability.\n   - Household size of 4: Large households are often associated with more stability and less isolation.\n   - Lived with both biological parents at age 12: Stable family environments during childhood are known to reduce the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\n4. Collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n   Based on these factors, the individual appears to have a moderate risk profile. While there are some positive indicators (stable job history, large household), the male gender and lack of long-term relationships increase the risk. However, given that none of the factors strongly suggest high-risk behavior, I would predict \"NO\" for rearrest within three years.\n\n5. Estimate confidence level:\n   Given the moderate nature of this profile, I would estimate a confidence level around 70-80%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive and balanced. However, I should consider that multiple factors contribute to recidivism risk, including criminal history (not provided in the question) and other personal characteristics. The lack of information on previous convictions or specific types of crimes might lead to a slightly lower confidence level than initially estimated.\n\nLet's adjust the confidence level to 75% to account for this uncertainty.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"high\", \"Males are generally at higher risk for criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable long-term relationships can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Similar to never married, lack of stable partnership can contribute to increased risk.\"),\n    (\"Held 3 jobs\", \"low\", \"While job instability is generally a risk factor, holding multiple jobs might also indicate adaptability and employability.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"low\", \"Large households are often associated with more stability and less isolation, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Lived with both biological parents at age 12\", \"low\", \"Stable family environments during childhood are known to reduce the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\n</output>",
