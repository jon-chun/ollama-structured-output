    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information about the individual's background and determine the risk factors for 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors from the given information:\n   - Male gender\n   - Married with spouse present\n   - Held 2 jobs\n   - Household size of 2\n   - Lived with other adults (at age 12)\n   - Not in group quarters at age 12\n   - Unknown biological parent status\n\n2. Assign relative weights to each factor:\n   - Male gender: High risk (males have higher recidivism rates)\n   - Married with spouse present: Low risk (stable relationship can be protective)\n   - Held 2 jobs: Medium risk (employment history is generally positive, but two jobs might indicate instability)\n   - Household size of 2: Low risk (small household can be more stable)\n   - Lived with other adults at age 12: High risk (unusual living arrangement may indicate family issues)\n   - Not in group quarters at age 12: Medium risk (neutral factor, but absence from institutional care might be positive)\n   - Unknown biological parent status: High risk (uncertainty about parental involvement can be a negative indicator)\n\n3. Consider the overall picture:\n   The individual has some stabilizing factors (marriage, employment) but also several concerning ones (male gender, unusual childhood living arrangements, unknown parental status).\n\n4. Make a prediction and determine confidence level:\n   Based on the analysis, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism. However, given the mix of positive and negative factors, I would assign a moderate to low confidence level (around 60%).\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. I've considered all provided information and assigned weights based on general knowledge about risk factors for recidivism. The prediction and confidence level align with the overall assessment of both positive and negative indicators. This approach appears sound and consistent with expert judgment in criminal justice risk assessment.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"High\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"Married with spouse present\", \"Low\", \"Stable marriage can be a protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Held 2 jobs\", \"Medium\", \"Employment history is positive, but two jobs might indicate job instability\"),\n    (\"Household size of 2\", \"Low\", \"Small household typically indicates more stable living conditions\"),\n    (\"Lived with other adults at age 12\", \"High\", \"Unusual childhood living arrangements can be a risk factor for future criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Not in group quarters at age 12\", \"Medium\", \"Neutral factor, but absence from institutional care might be slightly positive\"),\n    (\"Unknown biological parent status\", \"High\", \"Uncertainty about parental involvement can be a negative indicator\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis assessment takes into account various factors related to the individual's background and living situation. While there are some stabilizing elements (marriage, employment history), several concerning factors stand out:\n\n1. The individual's male gender is associated with higher recidivism rates.\n2. Unusual childhood living arrangements (living with other adults at age 12) can be a risk factor for future criminal behavior.\n3. Uncertainty about biological parent status may indicate family instability or lack of support.\n\nThese factors, combined with the mixed employment history and unknown long-term stability of the household, lead to a prediction of recidivism within three years. However, due to the presence of some positive indicators (marriage, not being in group quarters at age 12), the confidence level is set at 60%, indicating that while there's a significant risk, it's not an absolute certainty.\n\n</output>",
