    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each factor provided and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) based on its potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these weights to make an overall prediction of rearrest recidivism within 3 years.\n\nLet's break down the plan:\n\n1. Analyze each risk factor:\n   - Gender\n   - Marital status\n   - Employment history\n   - Household size\n   - Family structure at age 12\n\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its potential impact on recidivism\n\n3. Use these weighted factors to make an overall prediction of rearrest recidivism within 3 years\n\n4. Determine the confidence level in the prediction\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Analyze each risk factor and assign weights:\n\na) Gender: Female\nWeight: Low (Women generally have lower recidivism rates than men)\n\nb) Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting\nWeight: Medium (Being unmarried or not in a stable partnership can increase social isolation and reduce support systems)\n\nc) Employment history: 3 jobs\nWeight: High (Job instability is often associated with higher recidivism risk)\n\nd) Household size: 4\nWeight: Low (A larger household may indicate more family support, which can be protective against recidivism)\n\ne) Family structure at age 12: Lived with both biological parents\nWeight: Low (Growing up in a stable two-parent household is generally considered positive for long-term outcomes)\n\n2. Overall assessment:\nThe factors with the highest risk are job instability and lack of stable partnership, which have medium to high weights. However, these negative factors are somewhat offset by being female and having a supportive family background.\n\n3. Prediction:\nBased on this analysis, I would predict that this individual is likely NOT to be rearrested within 3 years.\n\n4. Confidence level:\nGiven the balance of positive and negative factors, I would assign a moderate confidence level (60%) to this prediction.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive and considers all provided factors. The assignment of weights appears reasonable based on general criminological research. However, it's important to note that real-world risk assessment tools typically use more complex algorithms and incorporate many additional factors for accuracy. This simplified approach is based on the information given in the question.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"Generally associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable partnership may increase social isolation and reduce support systems\"),\n    (\"3 jobs held\", \"high\", \"Job instability is often linked to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"low\", \"May indicate more family support, which can be protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Lived with both biological parents at age 12\", \"low\", \"Generally associated with better long-term outcomes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n</output>",
