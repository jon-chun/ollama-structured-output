    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided and assign a risk factor weight (low, medium, high) along with reasoning. Then, I'll use these factors to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each given fact:\n   - Male\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held 2 jobs\n   - Household size: 4\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown\n\n2. Assign risk factors and weights for each piece of information:\n\n   a) Gender (Male): Medium to High\n      Reasoning: Males generally have a higher recidivism rate than females.\n\n   b) Marital Status (Never married): High\n      Reasoning: Unmarried individuals, especially men, are often associated with higher risk factors.\n\n   c) Cohabitation (Not cohabiting): High\n      Reasoning: Lack of stable relationships can indicate instability and potential for risky behavior.\n\n   d) Employment History (2 jobs): Medium to Low\n      Reasoning: Having held multiple jobs could indicate some stability, but it's not a strong positive factor.\n\n   e) Household Size (4): Neutral (not explicitly low or high)\n      Reasoning: This information alone doesn't provide clear evidence of risk or safety.\n\n   f) Living Situation at Age 12 (with biological mother, unknown marital status): High\n      Reasoning: Uncertainty about the family structure and potential lack of stable male role models could be a risk factor.\n\n3. Consider the collective picture:\n   - Most factors point to high risk.\n   - The only potentially mitigating factor is employment history.\n\n4. Make a prediction based on these factors:\n   Given the preponderance of high-risk factors, the likelihood of rearrest within three years seems elevated.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe my analysis covers all provided information and considers relevant aspects of each factor. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on limited data compared to a comprehensive risk assessment in real-world scenarios. The prediction should be considered preliminary and may not reflect the full complexity of actual criminal justice assessments.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"Medium to High\", \"Males generally have a higher recidivism rate than females\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"High\", \"Unmarried individuals, especially men, are often associated with higher risk factors\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation\", \"High\", \"Lack of stable relationships can indicate instability and potential for risky behavior\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"Medium to Low\", \"Having held multiple jobs could indicate some stability, but it's not a strong positive factor\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"Neutral\", \"This information alone doesn't provide clear evidence of risk or safety\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Age 12\", \"High\", \"Uncertainty about the family structure and potential lack of stable male role models could be a risk factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n</output>",
