    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information, assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their potential impact on recidivism, and then use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors from the given information\n2. Analyze each factor's potential impact on recidivism\n3. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor\n4. Consider the collective impact of these factors on recidivism risk\n5. Make an overall prediction and estimate confidence\n\nLet's work through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Relevant factors:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Cohabiting\n   - Held only 1 job\n   - Household size of 5\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n\n2. Analyzing and assigning weights to each factor:\n\n   a) Male gender: Medium risk - Males are generally more likely to reoffend than females.\n   \n   b) Never married: High risk - Unmarried individuals may have less social stability and support.\n   \n   c) Cohabiting: Low-Medium risk - This could be seen as positive (stable relationship) or negative (unofficial commitment).\n   \n   d) Held only 1 job: Medium-High risk - Limited employment history can indicate instability.\n   \n   e) Household size of 5: High risk - Large households may have more stress and less individual attention.\n   \n   f) Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): Low-Medium risk - This alone doesn't strongly indicate a high-risk situation.\n\n3. Considering the collective impact:\n   The majority of these factors suggest an increased risk of recidivism, particularly the lack of marital stability and limited employment history.\n\n4. Making an overall prediction:\n   Based on this analysis, it appears that the individual is at higher risk for rearrest within 3 years.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize I may have been too lenient in my initial assessment. The cumulative effect of these factors, especially the lack of marital stability and limited employment history, suggests a higher risk than initially considered. Additionally, while cohabiting might be seen as positive, it's not as stable as being married. Therefore, I should adjust the weights and prediction accordingly.\n</reflection>\n\nRevised analysis:\n\na) Male gender: Medium risk\nb) Never married: High risk\nc) Cohabiting: Low-Medium risk (revised to Low)\nd) Held only 1 job: Medium-High risk (revised to High)\ne) Household size of 5: High risk\nf) Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): Low risk\n\nPrediction: YES\nConfidence: 80%\n\n<reflection>\nAfter this revised analysis, the prediction and confidence level seem more appropriate given the cumulative effect of these factors. The high risk associated with never being married and having limited employment history, combined with other less favorable factors, strongly suggests an increased likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"Medium\", \"Males generally have a higher recidivism rate than females\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"High\", \"Unmarried individuals often lack the stability and support that comes with marriage\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting\", \"Low\", \"While not as stable as being married, cohabitation can provide some level of relationship stability\"),\n    (\"Held only 1 job\", \"High\", \"Limited employment history indicates potential instability and difficulty maintaining consistent work\"),\n    (\"Household size of 5\", \"High\", \"Large households often face more stress and may have less individual attention available for each member\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\", \"Low\", \"This factor alone doesn't strongly indicate a high-risk situation\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
