    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll develop a step-by-step plan to analyze the risk factors and make a prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n1. Identify all given information about the individual.\n2. Analyze each piece of information as potential risk factors.\n3. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each factor based on criminal risk assessment principles.\n4. Consider how these factors collectively influence recidivism risk.\n5. Make a prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism based on the analysis.\n6. Estimate confidence in the prediction.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Given information:\n   - Female\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held 3 jobs\n   - Household size of 4\n   - Lived with biological dad at age 12, marital status unknown\n\n2. Analyzing risk factors and assigning relative weights:\n\na) Gender: Female (low)\nFemales generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\n\nb) Marital Status: Never married (medium)\nBeing unmarried can be a risk factor for criminal behavior due to potential lack of stable social support.\n\nc) Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting (medium)\nLiving alone or in unstable relationships can increase criminal behavior risks.\n\nd) Employment history: Held 3 jobs (low-medium)\nThis suggests some job stability, which is generally positive for reducing recidivism risk.\n\ne) Household size: 4 (neutral/low)\nA moderate household size doesn't strongly influence criminal behavior one way or the other.\n\nf) Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown (medium-high)\nThis could indicate an unstable family environment in adolescence, which can increase recidivism risk.\n\n3. Considering collective factors:\nThe combination of relatively stable employment history and moderate demographic factors balances out some higher-risk elements like never being married and potentially unstable childhood living arrangements.\n\n4. Prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nBased on the balanced set of factors, I would predict \"NO\" for rearrest within 3 years.\n\n5. Confidence in prediction:\nI estimate a confidence level of about 70% based on the analysis of these specific risk factors and their relative weights.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. The assigned weights and final prediction appear to be consistent with criminal justice research principles. However, it's important to note that real-world recidivism predictions would require more information and potentially involve more complex statistical models.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Female\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status: Never married\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried can be a risk factor for criminal behavior due to potential lack of stable social support.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Living alone or in unstable relationships can increase criminal behavior risks.\"),\n    (\"Employment history: Held 3 jobs\", \"low-medium\", \"This suggests some job stability, which is generally positive for reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"neutral/low\", \"A moderate household size doesn't strongly influence criminal behavior one way or the other.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown\", \"medium-high\", \"This could indicate an unstable family environment in adolescence, which can increase recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
