    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided and assess its potential impact on criminal recidivism risk. Then, I'll use these assessments to make a prediction about the likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors from the given information\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its potential impact on recidivism risk\n3. Provide a textual explanation for each assessment\n4. Use these assessments to make an overall prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism\n5. Estimate confidence in the prediction\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n1. Identifying relevant factors:\n   - Gender: Male\n   - Marital status: Never married, not cohabiting\n   - Employment history: Held 2 jobs\n   - Household size: 4\n   - Family structure at age 12: Lived with biological mother (marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assigning weights and explanations:\n\n   a) Male gender:\n      Weight: Medium\n      Reasoning: Research shows that males are generally more likely to be involved in criminal activities than females, but this is not an extremely strong predictor on its own.\n\n   b) Never married, not cohabiting:\n      Weight: High\n      Reasoning: Unstable or non-existent family ties can increase the likelihood of recidivism. Single status may indicate less social support and more freedom to engage in risky behaviors.\n\n   c) Held 2 jobs:\n      Weight: Low\n      Reasoning: This suggests some level of employability but doesn't necessarily indicate stable employment history, which could be a protective factor against recidivism.\n\n   d) Household size of 4:\n      Weight: Medium\n      Reasoning: A larger household may indicate more family responsibilities and potentially less time for criminal activities, but it's not a strong predictor either way.\n\n   e) Lived with biological mother (marital status unknown) at age 12:\n      Weight: High\n      Reasoning: An unstable or non-traditional home environment during adolescence can increase the risk of future criminal behavior.\n\n3. Overall prediction and confidence:\n\nBased on these factors, particularly the high-risk indicators of never being married/not cohabiting and an uncertain family structure at a young age, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\nPrediction: YES\nConfidence: 70%\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our analysis:\n- We've considered all provided information.\n- The weights assigned seem reasonable based on criminological research.\n- The overall prediction is based on the cumulative effect of these factors, with particular emphasis on those indicating potential instability or lack of strong social bonds.\n\nOne thing to consider is that we don't have information about prior criminal history, which would typically be a significant predictor. However, given the information available and focusing strictly on the provided details, our analysis appears comprehensive.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"medium\", \"Research shows males are generally more likely to be involved in criminal activities than females, but this is not an extremely strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Never married, not cohabiting\", \"high\", \"Unstable or non-existent family ties can increase the likelihood of recidivism.
