    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to carefully analyze each piece of information provided and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict the likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n\nLet's break down the plan:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors from the given information\n2. Analyze each factor and assign its relative weight\n3. Consider how these factors interact with each other\n4. Make a prediction based on the cumulative effect of these factors\n5. Determine confidence level in the prediction\n\nNow, let's work through this plan:\n\n1. Relevant risk factors:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Unemployed\n   - Household size (4)\n   - Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Analyzing and weighting each factor:\n   a) Male gender: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Males are generally at higher risk for criminal activity than females, but this is not an extremely high-risk factor on its own.\n\n   b) Never married: Medium to High risk\n      Reasoning: Lack of stable marital relationships can indicate social isolation or difficulty in forming long-term commitments, which may correlate with increased criminal behavior.\n\n   c) Not cohabiting: Low to Medium risk\n      Reasoning: While this could be a factor indicating instability, it's not as strong as being never married. Cohabitation status alone isn't typically a major predictor of recidivism.\n\n   d) Unemployed: High risk\n      Reasoning: Lack of employment is strongly correlated with higher rates of criminal behavior and recidivism. It suggests potential financial struggles and lack of structure in daily life.\n\n   e) Household size (4): Low to Medium risk\n      Reasoning: A larger household can be stressful, but it also potentially provides more social support. The effect on recidivism is generally less significant than other factors.\n\n   f) Living situation at age 12: High risk\n      Reasoning: An unstable or unknown family environment at a young age (12) can indicate long-term social and emotional difficulties that may lead to increased criminal behavior.\n\n3. Interactions between factors:\n   - The combination of being never married, not cohabiting, and unemployed creates a picture of significant social isolation and potential financial strain.\n   - The early childhood living situation, combined with the person's current marital status, suggests a lifetime pattern of unstable relationships.\n\n4. Prediction based on cumulative effect:\n   Given the high-risk factors (unemployment, potentially unstable childhood environment) and medium to high-risk factors (never married), it seems likely that this individual would be at risk for rearrest within 3 years.\n\n5. Confidence level:\n   The combination of several significant risk factors suggests a strong likelihood of recidivism. However, the lack of information about criminal history or specific offenses limits our confidence slightly.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe my analysis covers all relevant factors and considers their interactions appropriately. The weightings seem balanced based on criminological research. However, it's worth noting that real-world risk assessment would typically involve more detailed and specific information (e.g., criminal history, mental health status). Given the limitations of this scenario, our prediction should be viewed with some caution.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"Males are generally at higher risk for criminal activity than females, but this is not an extremely high-risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable marital relationships can indicate social isolation or difficulty in forming long-term commitments, which may correlate with increased criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"While this could be a factor indicating instability, it's not as strong as being never married.

The person's unemployed status, never-married condition, and potentially unstable childhood environment stand out as particularly significant indicators of higher recidivism risk.\n\nThe male gender and living situation in a larger household (size 4) contribute additional, though less severe, risk factors. The lack of cohabitation is considered the least impactful factor among those listed but still contributes to an overall picture of instability.\n\nGiven these cumulative factors, especially the strong indicators of unemployment and potentially lifelong relationship difficulties, it's reasonable to predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within 3 years. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and real-world risk assessments would typically involve more detailed data such as criminal history and specific offense information.\n\nThe confidence level of 85% reflects the significant weight of these factors while acknowledging some uncertainty due to the limited scope of the provided information.\n</output>",
