    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze each factor mentioned in the scenario and assign a risk level for recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict rearrest within three years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each given factor:\n   - Female gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held 3 jobs\n   - Household size of 5\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assign a risk level to each factor based on general knowledge about recidivism:\n   - Female gender: Low\n   - Never married: Medium\n   - Not cohabiting: Medium\n   - Held 3 jobs: Medium\n   - Household size of 5: High\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): Medium\n\n3. Explain the reasoning behind each risk level:\n\n   a) Female gender: Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n\n   b) Never married: This can indicate instability or lack of social support, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\n\n   c) Not cohabiting: Similar to never being married, this could suggest lack of stable relationships.\n\n   d) Held 3 jobs: While job stability is important, frequent job changes might indicate difficulties in maintaining employment or impulsivity.\n\n   e) Household size of 5: Large household sizes can be associated with increased stress and potential instability.\n\n   f) Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown): This could indicate family instability early in life.\n\n4. Collectively assess the risk factors to predict rearrest within three years:\n   - There are more medium-risk factors than low or high-risk ones.\n   - No extremely high-risk factors were mentioned, but there's a mix of moderate risks and some potentially stable elements (female gender).\n\n5. Determine the prediction and confidence level:\n   Based on this analysis, I would predict YES for rearrest within three years due to the cumulative effect of medium-risk factors outweighing the low-risk factor.\n\n<reflection>\nLet me review my analysis:\n- The reasoning behind each risk level seems sound based on general knowledge about recidivism.\n- The prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest aligns with the overall assessment of more medium-risk than low or high-risk factors.\n- However, I should consider that there are no extremely high-risk factors, which might suggest a lower confidence level in this prediction.\n\nGiven this reflection, I believe my analysis is comprehensive and well-reasoned. The risk levels assigned and the final prediction appear to be appropriate based on the information provided.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"This can indicate instability or lack of social support, potentially increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Similar to never being married, this could suggest lack of stable relationships\"),\n    (\"Held 3 jobs\", \"medium\", \"While job stability is important, frequent job changes might indicate difficulties in maintaining employment or impulsivity\"),\n    (\"Household size of 5\", \"high\", \"Large household sizes can be associated with increased stress and potential instability\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\", \"medium\", \"This could indicate family instability early in life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThe analysis suggests that the individual is at risk of rearrest within three years due to a combination of factors, particularly the prevalence of medium-risk indicators such as never being married, not cohabiting, frequent job changes, and potential family instability in their past. While there are no extremely high-risk factors present, these moderate risks cumulatively outweigh the single low-risk factor (female gender).\n\nThe confidence level is set at 70% because while the prediction leans towards recidivism, there are no extremely high-risk factors that would make this prediction near certain. Additionally, some of these factors could be mitigated by positive influences or interventions in the individual's life.\n\nIt's important to note that criminal risk assessment is complex and should consider a wide range of factors beyond those provided in this scenario. This analysis serves as an example based on limited information and should not be used for actual legal or clinical decision-making.\n</output>",
