    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information about the individual's background and assign risk factors for rearrest recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors to predict whether the person will be rearrested within three years. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Identify potential risk factors from the given information\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its relevance to criminal recidivism\n3. Analyze and combine these factors to make a prediction\n4. Estimate confidence in the prediction\n\nLet's go through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Potential risk factors:\n   - Never married status\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Limited job stability (2 jobs)\n   - Household size of 4\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown\n\n2. Assigning relative weights and reasoning for each factor:\n\n   a) Never married: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: While not necessarily a direct cause of criminal behavior, being never married might indicate social instability or lack of family support.\n\n   b) Not cohabiting: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Similar to the previous point, this could suggest less stable living arrangements.\n\n   c) Limited job stability (2 jobs): High risk\n      Reasoning: Multiple short-term jobs may indicate difficulty maintaining employment, potentially leading to financial instability and increased likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\n   d) Household size of 4: Low risk\n      Reasoning: A larger household can sometimes provide more support and resources, potentially reducing the need for criminal activity.\n\n   e) Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: This could indicate an unstable family environment during childhood, which is a known risk factor for future criminal behavior.\n\n3. Combining these factors:\n   - We have one high-risk factor (job instability), three medium-risk factors (never married, not cohabiting, and potential childhood family issues), and one low-risk factor (household size).\n\n4. Making the prediction and estimating confidence:\n   Based on this analysis, I would predict that this person is likely to be rearrested within 3 years.\n   Confidence level: 80% (due to the presence of multiple risk factors)\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our analysis:\n- We've considered all given information as potential risk factors.\n- The weights assigned seem appropriate based on general knowledge of criminal recidivism predictors.\n- The combination of high and medium-risk factors outweighs the single low-risk factor, supporting a positive prediction for rearrest.\n- An 80% confidence level seems reasonable given the presence of multiple significant risk factors.\n\nThis analysis appears comprehensive and well-reasoned. We can proceed with confidence in our conclusion.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"While not necessarily a direct cause of criminal behavior, being never married might indicate social instability or lack of family support.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"This could suggest less stable living arrangements, potentially increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Limited job stability (2 jobs)\", \"high\", \"Multiple short-term jobs may indicate difficulty maintaining employment, potentially leading to financial instability and increased likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"low\", \"A larger household can sometimes provide more support and resources, potentially reducing the need for criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status unknown\", \"medium\", \"This could indicate an unstable family environment during childhood, which is a known risk factor for future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis analysis indicates that based on the given information, there is a high likelihood (80% confidence) that this individual will be rearrested within three years. The prediction is primarily driven by several significant risk factors:\n\n1. Limited job stability: Having held only two jobs suggests difficulty in maintaining employment, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\n2. Social instability indicators: Being never married and not cohabiting may indicate less stable living arrangements and potentially less family support, both of which are associated with higher rates of recidivism.\n\n3. Potential childhood family issues: Living with a biological mother at age 12 without known marital status could suggest an unstable family environment during childhood, which is often linked to increased risk of future criminal behavior.\n\nThese factors outweigh the single low-risk factor (household size of 4), leading to the overall positive prediction for rearrest within three years. However, it's important to note that while this analysis provides a strong indication based on statistical trends and known risk factors, individual outcomes can vary greatly due to numerous personal and circumstantial factors not accounted for in this assessment.\n\n</output>",
