    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information about the individual and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the risk factors from the given information:\n   - Male\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held 2 jobs\n   - Household size of 3\n   - Lived with adoptive parent(s) at age 12\n\n2. Assign a relative weight to each factor based on its potential impact on recidivism:\n   - Male: High (Males are generally more likely to be rearrested)\n   - Never married: Medium (Marital status can have mixed effects on criminal behavior)\n   - Not cohabiting: Medium (Similar to marital status, with mixed potential impacts)\n   - Held 2 jobs: Low (Stable employment tends to reduce recidivism risk)\n   - Household size of 3: Low (A moderate household size doesn't typically increase risk)\n   - Lived with adoptive parent(s) at age 12: Medium (Childhood living arrangements can have mixed effects)\n\n3. Analyze the overall pattern:\n   - We have one high-risk factor (male), three medium-risk factors, and two low-risk factors.\n   - The presence of some stable elements in his life (two jobs, moderate household size) suggests potential for rehabilitation.\n\n4. Make a collective prediction:\n   Based on this analysis, it seems more likely than not that the individual will be rearrested within 3 years. However, given the mixed nature of these factors and the positive aspects (stable employment), I'll assign a moderate confidence level to this prediction.\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our analysis:\n- We've considered all provided information.\n- The weight assignments seem reasonable based on common risk assessment criteria.\n- The overall pattern is balanced between higher-risk and lower-risk factors.\n- Our conclusion takes into account both the negative and positive aspects of his situation.\n\nThis approach appears comprehensive and well-reasoned. Let's proceed with creating the JSON object.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male\", \"high\", \"Males are generally more likely to be rearrested\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"Marital status can have mixed effects on criminal behavior, but may indicate lack of stability\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Similar to marital status, with mixed potential impacts on recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Held 2 jobs\", \"low\", \"Stable employment tends to reduce recidivism risk by providing structure and income\"),\n    (\"Household size of 3\", \"low\", \"A moderate household size doesn't typically increase risk factors for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Lived with adoptive parent(s) at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Childhood living arrangements can have mixed effects on adult criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n</output>",
