    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine its weight (low, medium, high) based on its potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these weighted factors to make a prediction about the likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n\nLet's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Demographics:\n   - Male\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n\n2. Employment history:\n   - Held only one job\n\n3. Household information:\n   - Household size: 3\n\n4. Family background:\n   - Lived with both biological parents at age 12\n\nNow, let's analyze each factor:\n\n1. Male gender: This is generally considered a high-risk factor for recidivism.\n\n2. Never married and not cohabiting: These factors are often associated with higher risk of criminal behavior.\n\n3. Held only one job: Job instability can be a moderate to high-risk factor.\n\n4. Household size: A household size of 3 is relatively small, which could potentially indicate a more stable environment, but this alone isn't strongly indicative either way.\n\n5. Lived with both biological parents at age 12: This generally suggests a more stable childhood and lower risk for criminal behavior.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive. However, I should consider that never being married might be less of a risk factor if we don't have information about the person's age or whether they've had long-term relationships. Additionally, living with both biological parents at 12 doesn't necessarily mean the entire childhood was stable.\n</reflection>\n\nAfter this reflection, let me adjust some assessments:\n\n1. Male gender: High\n2. Never married and not cohabiting: Medium (could be lower if we knew more about age or relationship history)\n3. Held only one job: Medium to High\n4. Household size: Low (neither strongly positive nor negative)\n5. Childhood family structure: Low\n\nNow, let's combine these factors:\n\nLow-risk factors: Childhood family structure, household size\nMedium-risk factors: Never married and not cohabiting, held only one job\nHigh-risk factor: Male gender\n\nThe overall assessment leans towards medium to high risk due to the presence of several moderate risk factors and one strong risk factor (male gender).\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering all factors collectively, I believe a 3-year rearrest prediction should lean towards \"YES\" with a moderate confidence level. The presence of multiple risk factors outweighs the single low-risk factor.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"high\", \"Generally associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Never married and not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Could indicate lack of social support or stability, but may be less relevant depending on age or relationship history\"),\n    (\"Held only one job\", \"medium to high\", \"Suggests potential employment instability which can contribute to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Household size of 3\", \"low\", \"Neither strongly indicative of increased nor decreased risk; a relatively small household could suggest some stability\"),\n    (\"Lived with both biological parents at age 12\", \"low\", \"Generally associated with lower recidivism risk, suggesting a more stable childhood environment\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis assessment is based on the combination of several moderate to high-risk factors that outweigh the single low-risk factor. The prediction leans towards \"YES\" for rearrest within 3 years, with a confidence level of 60%.\n\nThe male gender and job instability are significant risk factors, while never being married and not cohabiting could potentially contribute to higher risk if we consider this as an indicator of social support or stability issues.\n\nOn the other hand, living with both biological parents at age 12 is generally associated with lower recidivism risk, suggesting a more stable childhood environment. This factor somewhat mitigates the overall risk but isn't strong enough to outweigh the other factors combined.\n\nIt's important to note that this assessment has a moderate confidence level due to the limitations in the provided information. Factors such as age, education level, and type of offense (if any) are not included, which could significantly impact the accuracy of the prediction.\n</output>",
