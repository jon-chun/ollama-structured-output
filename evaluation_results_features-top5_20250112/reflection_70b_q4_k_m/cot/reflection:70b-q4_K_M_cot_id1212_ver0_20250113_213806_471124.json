    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information about the individual's background and assign risk factors for recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors to predict whether they will be rearrested within three years. Let's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify relevant risk factors from the given information\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its potential impact on recidivism\n3. Analyze and combine these factors to make an overall prediction of rearrest within 3 years\n4. Determine a confidence level for this prediction\n\nStep 1: Identifying relevant risk factors\n- Marital status (never married)\n- Cohabitation status (not cohabiting)\n- Employment status (currently unemployed)\n- Household size (6 people)\n- Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, unknown marital status)\n\nStep 2: Assigning relative weights to each factor\n\n1. Never married:\n   Weight: High\n   Reasoning: Lack of stable relationships and potentially less social support.\n\n2. Not cohabiting:\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: While not ideal, it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk if they have other forms of support.\n\n3. Currently unemployed:\n   Weight: High\n   Reasoning: Unemployment is often strongly associated with increased crime rates and recidivism.\n\n4. Household size (6 people):\n   Weight: Low\n   Reasoning: While potentially stressful, it doesn't directly correlate to a high risk of recidivism.\n\n5. Living situation at age 12:\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Unknown marital status may indicate instability but is less clear in its impact.\n\nStep 3: Combining factors for prediction\n\nThe individual has two high-risk factors (never married, currently unemployed) and two medium-risk factors (not cohabiting, living situation at age 12). The only low-risk factor is the household size. This suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism due to potential instability in personal life and employment.\n\nPrediction: YES\nConfidence: 70\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe my analysis covers all relevant information provided and assigns reasonable weights based on known risk factors for recidivism. The prediction of \"YES\" with 70% confidence seems appropriate given the combination of high-risk factors (marital status and employment) along with some additional stability issues. However, I should emphasize that this is a simplified model and real-world assessments would involve many more factors.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable relationships and potentially less social support can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"While not ideal, it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk if other forms of support are present\"),\n    (\"Currently unemployed\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is strongly associated with increased crime rates and recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size (6 people)\", \"low\", \"Potentially stressful but doesn't directly correlate to a high risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, unknown marital status)\", \"medium\", \"May indicate instability in early life which can be a moderate risk factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis assessment takes into account several key factors that influence recidivism rates. The individual's never-married status and current unemployment are significant risk factors, suggesting potential instability in personal life and economic struggles, which can contribute to higher likelihood of rearrest.\n\nWhile not cohabiting is a less ideal situation, it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk if other forms of support exist. Living with six people may be stressful but isn't typically considered a major factor for recidivism. The early living situation with the biological mother and unknown marital status could have caused some childhood instability, which can influence later behavior to some extent.\n\nBased on this analysis, it's predicted that the individual has a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years. However, due to the complexity of human factors involved in recidivism and without more comprehensive information about criminal history or personal circumstances, we assign a confidence level of 70%.\n\nThis assessment is based on general risk factors for recidivism but should be interpreted with caution as it lacks specific details about past offenses, treatment programs, or other potentially mitigating factors. In real-world scenarios, a much more detailed and comprehensive analysis would be conducted to make such predictions.\n</output>",
