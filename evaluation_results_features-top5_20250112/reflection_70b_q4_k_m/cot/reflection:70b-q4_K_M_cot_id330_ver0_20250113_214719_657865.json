    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each given factor and assign a risk weight based on its potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\nLet's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Female (gender)\n2. Never married\n3. Cohabiting\n4. Held 1 job\n5. Household size: 5\n6. Lived with both biological parents at age 12\n\nNow, let's analyze each factor and assign a risk weight:\n\n1. Gender (Female): Low risk - Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males.\n2. Never married: Medium risk - Lack of stable partnerships can be associated with higher crime rates.\n3. Cohabiting: Medium risk - While not married, cohabitation suggests some level of stability.\n4. Held 1 job: High risk - Limited employment history is often associated with higher recidivism.\n5. Household size: 5: Low risk - Larger households can provide more support and structure.\n6. Lived with both biological parents at age 12: Low risk - Stable family environment in adolescence is generally positive.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, these assessments seem reasonable based on general trends in criminology research. However, it's important to note that individual circumstances can vary greatly, and some factors might interact in complex ways. The \"held 1 job\" factor stands out as particularly concerning for recidivism risk.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's use these factors collectively to make a prediction:\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering all the factors:\n- There are three low-risk factors (gender, household size, family environment)\n- Two medium-risk factors (marital status, cohabitation)\n- One high-risk factor (employment history)\n\nThe presence of multiple low-risk factors suggests that while there are some positive aspects in this person's life, the significant employment risk and lack of marital stability could potentially outweigh these. The overall picture leans more towards a higher risk of recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, I would predict \"YES\" for rearrest within three years, with a moderate to high confidence level.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Female\", \"low\", \"Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable partnerships can be associated with higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"While not married, cohabitation suggests some level of stability.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job\", \"high\", \"Limited employment history is often associated with higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household size: 5\", \"low\", \"Larger households can provide more support and structure.\"),\n    (\"Lived with both biological parents at age 12\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment in adolescence is generally positive.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
