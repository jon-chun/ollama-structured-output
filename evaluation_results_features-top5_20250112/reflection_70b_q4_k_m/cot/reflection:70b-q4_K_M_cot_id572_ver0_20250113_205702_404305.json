    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each risk factor provided and assign a relative weight based on criminal justice research. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict the likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n\n1. Gender: Male\n2. Marital status: Never married\n3. Living arrangement: Not cohabiting\n4. Employment history: Held 3 jobs\n5. Household size: 4\n6. Family structure at age 12: Lived with both biological parents\n\nNow, I'll assign a relative weight to each factor and provide reasoning:\n\n1. Gender (Male): High risk - Research consistently shows males are more likely to recidivate than females.\n2. Never married: Medium risk - While not strongly correlated, unmarried individuals may have less social support.\n3. Not cohabiting: Medium risk - Similar to marital status, lack of a stable partner might contribute to higher risk.\n4. Held 3 jobs: High risk - Frequent job changes can indicate instability or poor work habits.\n5. Household size (4): Low risk - Larger households may provide more support and accountability.\n6. Family structure at age 12: Low risk - Living with both biological parents is generally associated with lower delinquency rates.\n\nNow, I'll use these factors to predict the likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, while there are several high-risk factors (gender, job instability), they are balanced by some low-risk factors (family structure, household size). The medium-risk factors (marital status, living arrangement) don't strongly contribute in either direction. Overall, this suggests a moderate to high risk of recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict the individual will likely be rearrested within 3 years.\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering the balanced nature of these factors, my confidence level should be moderate rather than very high or very low. I'll assign a confidence level of 70%.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males are consistently shown to have higher recidivism rates in criminal justice research\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"medium\", \"While not strongly correlated, unmarried individuals may have less social support and stability\"),\n    (\"Living arrangement: Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Similar to marital status, lack of a stable partner might contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"Employment history: Held 3 jobs\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes can indicate instability or poor work habits that may correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"low\", \"Larger households may provide more support and accountability, potentially reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12: Lived with both biological parents\", \"low\", \"Generally associated with lower delinquency rates in adolescents\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
