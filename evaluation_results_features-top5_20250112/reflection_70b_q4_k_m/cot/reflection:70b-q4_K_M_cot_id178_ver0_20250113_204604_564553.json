    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll develop a step-by-step plan to analyze the given risk factors and make a prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors from the provided information.\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on their potential impact on recidivism.\n3. Provide textual reasoning for each assigned weight.\n4. Combine these weighted factors to make an overall prediction of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n5. Determine the confidence level in the prediction.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Identifying risk factors:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married status\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Employment history (2 jobs)\n   - Household size (7)\n   - Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assigning weights and reasoning:\n\n   a) Male gender: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Males are generally known to have higher recidivism rates than females.\n\n   b) Never married status: Medium-high risk\n      Reasoning: Lack of stable family ties can increase the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior.\n\n   c) Not cohabiting: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Similar to never being married, lack of a stable partnership may contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\n   d) Employment history (2 jobs): Low-medium risk\n      Reasoning: While having held multiple jobs can indicate instability, it also shows some level of employment engagement and potential for rehabilitation.\n\n   e) Household size (7): High risk\n      Reasoning: A large household often correlates with higher stress levels, potentially increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\n\n   f) Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, marital status unknown): Medium-high risk\n      Reasoning: Uncertainty about parental relationship stability during formative years can indicate potential family dynamics issues that may contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\n3. Combining these factors for prediction:\n   The majority of factors lean towards a medium to high risk profile. However, the presence of some employment history suggests a possibility for rehabilitation and lower recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize I should emphasize the importance of gender as a significant factor more clearly in my reasoning. Additionally, while the household size is assigned as high risk, its specific impact on this individual's recidivism rate might be less clear-cut compared to other factors.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Prediction and confidence:\n   Based on these weighted factors, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with a moderate level of confidence (around 60%).\n\n<reflection>\nAfter final consideration, I believe the prediction should remain as \"YES,\" but the confidence level could be adjusted slightly higher due to the cumulative effect of multiple medium and high-risk factors. A confidence level of 70% seems more appropriate.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"Males generally have a higher recidivism rate compared to females, contributing to a moderate risk profile.\"),\n    (\"Never married status\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable family ties can increase the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior, indicating a higher risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"While not having a partner may contribute to higher recidivism rates, this is considered a lower risk factor compared to other listed factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment history (2 jobs)\", \"medium\", \"Multiple job holdings can indicate employment engagement but also potential instability in work life.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 7\", \"high\", \"A large household often correlates with higher stress levels and potentially increased likelihood of recidivism, although its direct impact on this individual is less clear-cut.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, marital status unknown)\", \"medium-high\", \"Uncertainty about parental relationship stability during formative years can indicate potential family dynamics issues contributing to higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
