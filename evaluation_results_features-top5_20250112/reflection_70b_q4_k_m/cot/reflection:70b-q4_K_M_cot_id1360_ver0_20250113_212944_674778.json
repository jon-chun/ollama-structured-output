    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each factor mentioned in the input and assess its impact on recidivism risk. Then, I'll use these assessments to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors:\n   - Gender: Female\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\n   - Employment status: Unemployed\n   - Household size: 2\n   - Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown\n\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor and provide reasoning:\n\n   a) Gender: Low risk\n      Reasoning: Female offenders generally have lower recidivism rates than male offenders.\n\n   b) Marital status (Never married): Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Stable relationships can be protective factors. Never being married may indicate instability or lack of support networks.\n\n   c) Cohabitation status (Not cohabiting): Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Similar to marital status, not living with a partner may suggest fewer stabilizing influences in life.\n\n   d) Employment status (Unemployed): High risk\n      Reasoning: Unemployment is strongly associated with increased recidivism. It can lead to financial instability and lack of structure.\n\n   e) Household size (2): Low risk\n      Reasoning: A smaller household may indicate fewer potential stressors or conflicts, potentially reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\n\n   f) Living situation at age 12: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: The unknown marital status of the mother could indicate instability in the home environment during childhood, which can be a risk factor for later criminal behavior. However, it's not as direct an indicator as current factors.\n\n3. Analyze the overall picture and make a prediction:\n   - There are two low-risk factors (Gender, Household size)\n   - Three medium-risk factors (Marital status, Cohabitation status, Living situation at age 12)\n   - One high-risk factor (Employment status)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while the overall picture leans towards a higher risk of recidivism due to the presence of several medium and one high-risk factor, the two low-risk factors should not be overlooked. The strong negative impact of unemployment on recidivism rates in combination with some potentially unstable life circumstances (never married, not cohabiting) suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\n4. Assign confidence level:\n   Based on the analysis, I'd assign a moderate to high confidence level, around 75%. The factors presented provide significant insight into potential risk areas, but there are always variables not captured in such assessments that could influence outcomes.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female offenders generally have lower recidivism rates than male offenders\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships may indicate instability or lack of support networks\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Not living with a partner may suggest fewer stabilizing influences in life\"),\n    (\"Employment status: Unemployed\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is strongly associated with increased recidivism due to financial instability and lack of structure\"),\n    (\"Household size: 2\", \"low\", \"Smaller household potentially reduces stressors or conflicts, lowering the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown\", \"medium\", \"Unknown marital status of the mother could indicate childhood instability, a potential risk factor for later criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\n</output>",
