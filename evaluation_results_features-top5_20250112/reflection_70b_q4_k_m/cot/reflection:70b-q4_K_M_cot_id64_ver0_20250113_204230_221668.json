    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each risk factor and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) based on its potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these weighted factors to make an overall prediction of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. Never married\n2. Not cohabiting\n3. Held only 1 job\n4. Household size of 4\n5. Lived with both biological parents at age 12\n\nNow, let's analyze each factor and assign weights:\n\n1. Never married: Medium risk (lack of stable relationship)\n2. Not cohabiting: High risk (no current partner support)\n3. Held only 1 job: Low risk (stable employment history)\n4. Household size of 4: Low risk (supportive family structure)\n5. Lived with both biological parents at age 12: Low risk (stable childhood)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the factors seem to balance each other out. The negative factors (never married, not cohabiting) are offset by positive ones (stable job, supportive household). However, it's important to consider that overall stability in life is often a strong predictor of lower recidivism rates.\n</reflection>\n\nGiven this analysis, I'll proceed with the JSON output based on these weighted risk factors.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationship may increase stress and instability\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\", \"high\", \"Absence of partner support can lead to increased isolation and vulnerability\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held: 1 job\", \"low\", \"Stable employment history indicates responsibility and reliability\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4 members\", \"low\", \"Supportive family structure provides a stable environment\"),\n    (\"Family situation at age 12: Lived with both biological parents\", \"low\", \"Stable childhood often correlates with better adult outcomes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis prediction suggests that the individual is less likely to be rearrested within three years. The confidence level of 70% indicates a moderate degree of certainty in this assessment. While there are some risk factors present, such as never having been married and not currently cohabiting, these are largely offset by positive indicators like stable employment and a supportive family structure. The overall balance of these factors suggests that the individual's likelihood of recidivism is lower than average.\n\n</output>",
