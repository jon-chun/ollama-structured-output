    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information and assign risk factors for recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify relevant risk factors based on the given information:\n   - Male gender\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Cohabitation status (not cohabiting)\n   - Employment history (held 1 job)\n   - Household size (5)\n\n2. Research known recidivism risk factors and compare with our case\n\n3. Assign relative weights to each factor:\n   - Male gender: Medium risk\n   - Never married: High risk\n   - Not cohabiting: High risk\n   - Held 1 job: Low risk\n   - Household size of 5: Medium risk\n\n4. Consider any potential interactions or mitigating factors\n\n5. Make a prediction based on the overall assessment:\n   Given the higher risks associated with marital status and cohabitation, along with a medium risk for gender and household size, I would predict recidivism.\n\n6. Estimate confidence level in the prediction:\n   The combination of several high-risk factors makes me fairly confident in this prediction, but not extremely so due to some mitigating factors.\n\nNow, let's compile all this information into the required JSON format:\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"Males are generally at higher risk for recidivism than females.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Individuals who have never been married tend to have a higher risk of recidivism compared to those in stable relationships or with family ties.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"high\", \"Lack of a stable living situation can contribute to increased recidivism risk, as it often correlates with instability and lack of support networks.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job\", \"low\", \"Having held a job indicates some level of employment stability, which is generally associated with lower recidivism risk. However, holding only one job may suggest limited work experience or unstable employment history.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 5\", \"medium\", \"Large household sizes can be both protective and risky factors. While it suggests a potentially supportive family environment, it also indicates a complex living situation that could contribute to stress.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
