    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each factor and its potential impact on recidivism risk. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all the factors mentioned:\n   - Gender (male)\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Cohabitation status (cohabiting)\n   - Employment history (3 jobs held)\n   - Household size (4 people)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Analyze each factor and assign a relative weight:\n   - Gender: Typically considered low risk\n   - Marital status: Never married could be medium-high risk due to lack of stable family ties\n   - Cohabitation status: Cohabiting is generally seen as lower risk than single or never married, so let's say medium\n   - Employment history: Holding multiple jobs can indicate instability, so high risk\n   - Household size: Larger household could be associated with higher stress and potentially higher risk, so medium-high\n   - Family structure at age 12: Unknown marital status of mother could imply instability or unconventional family setup, which might be associated with higher risk\n\n3. Assess the overall picture:\n   We have a mix of low to high-risk factors. The presence of multiple jobs held (high risk) and potentially unstable family background are concerning.\n\n4. Make a prediction based on these factors:\n   Given the combination of factors, especially the high-risk ones related to employment stability and potential early life instability, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n5. Assign confidence level:\n   Based on the mixed bag of risk factors, but leaning towards higher risk overall, let's assign a moderate-high confidence level of 75%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. However, it might be worth considering that being male alone is not necessarily low risk, as males generally have higher recidivism rates than females. Additionally, while having multiple jobs can indicate instability, it could also show adaptability or a strong work ethic in some cases.\n\nLet's adjust our analysis slightly:\n- Male gender: Medium risk\n- Employment history: High risk (but with the caveat that job changes can sometimes be positive)\n\nThese adjustments don't change our overall prediction but provide a more nuanced view of each factor.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is generally associated with higher recidivism rates than female, so it's considered medium risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \"Being never married can indicate a lack of stable family ties and support, which may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"medium\", \"While cohabiting is generally seen as more stable than being single, it still lacks the legal commitment of marriage, so it's considered medium risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"high\", \"Having held multiple jobs can indicate employment instability or difficulty maintaining long-term positions, which may be associated with higher recidivism risk.
