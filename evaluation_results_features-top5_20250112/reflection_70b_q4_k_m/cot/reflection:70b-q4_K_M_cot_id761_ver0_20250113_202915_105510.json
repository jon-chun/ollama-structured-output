    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided and assess its relevance to criminal risk. Then, I'll combine these factors to make a prediction about rearrest recidivism within three years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify the given information:\n   - Gender: Male\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Living arrangement: Not cohabiting\n   - Employment history: Held 1 job\n   - Household size: 4\n   - Family structure at age 12: Lived with both biological parents\n\n2. Analyze each factor and assign a relative weight:\n   a) Gender: Male (High)\n      Reasoning: Males are generally more likely to be rearrested than females.\n\n   b) Marital status: Never married (Medium)\n      Reasoning: Being unmarried can increase risk, but it's not as strongly correlated as other factors.\n\n   c) Living arrangement: Not cohabiting (Low)\n      Reasoning: This factor is relatively neutral and less predictive of recidivism.\n\n   d) Employment history: Held 1 job (High)\n      Reasoning: Limited job stability is a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\n   e) Household size: 4 (Medium)\n      Reasoning: A medium-sized household might indicate some social support, but also potential stressors.\n\n   f) Family structure at age 12: Lived with both biological parents (Low)\n      Reasoning: This indicates stable family dynamics during adolescence, which is generally protective against recidivism.\n\n3. Combine these factors to make a prediction:\n   <reflection>\n   Upon reflection, the high-risk factors (gender and employment history) seem to outweigh the lower-risk factors. The medium-risk factors don't significantly tip the balance towards low risk. This suggests that the person might be at higher risk for rearrest recidivism.\n   </reflection>\n\n4. Assign a prediction and confidence level:\n   Prediction: YES\n   Confidence: 70%\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review our analysis:\n- We've considered all provided factors\n- The weightings seem reasonable based on criminological research\n- The combination of high-risk factors (male, limited job stability) outweighs the lower-risk factors\n- Our prediction and confidence level reflect this balance\n\nThe reasoning appears sound, so we can proceed with the output.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"High\", \"Males are generally more likely to be rearrested than females\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"Medium\", \"Being unmarried can increase risk, but it's not as strongly correlated with recidivism as other factors\"),\n    (\"Living arrangement: Not cohabiting\", \"Low\", \"This factor is relatively neutral and less predictive of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment history: Held 1 job\", \"High\", \"Limited job stability is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"Medium\", \"A medium-sized household might indicate some social support, but also potential stressors\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12: Lived with both biological parents\", \"Low\", \"This indicates stable family dynamics during adolescence, which is generally protective against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
