    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information and determine the risk factors for rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify potential risk factors from the given information:\n   - Female gender\n   - Never married status\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held only 1 job\n   - Large household size (10 people)\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12, but marital status unknown\n\n2. Assess each factor's potential impact on rearrest recidivism:\n   a) Female gender: Typically lower risk than male, so low.\n   b) Never married and not cohabiting: May indicate instability or lack of support, medium.\n   c) Held only 1 job: Could indicate employment issues or instability, medium.\n   d) Large household size: Potential stress factor and less individual attention, high.\n   e) Living situation at age 12: Unknown marital status could indicate unstable home life, high.\n\n3. Consider the overall picture:\n   Despite some positive factors (female gender), there are several concerning indicators of potential instability or lack of support in this person's life.\n\n4. Make a prediction based on these risk factors:\n   Given the combination of medium and high-risk factors, it's likely that this individual has a higher chance of rearrest recidivism within 3 years.\n\n5. Estimate confidence level:\n   While there are clear indicators of potential risk, we don't have information about criminal history or specific behavioral issues. Therefore, the confidence shouldn't be extremely high but still significant due to the multiple risk factors present.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. We've considered all given information and assessed its impact on rearrest recidivism risk. The prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest within 3 years aligns with the identified risk factors. However, we should note that in real-world scenarios, more information would be ideal for making a highly accurate prediction.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"Typically associated with lower recidivism rates than male offenders.\"),\n    (\"Never married and not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Indicates potential lack of stable support structure or family ties.\"),\n    (\"Held only 1 job\", \"medium\", \"May suggest employment instability or difficulty maintaining consistent work history.\"),\n    (\"Large household size (10 people)\", \"high\", \"Could contribute to stress, less individual attention, and potentially unstable home environment.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12 with biological mother of unknown marital status\", \"high\", \"Indicates potential childhood instability or lack of a two-parent household.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\n</output>",
