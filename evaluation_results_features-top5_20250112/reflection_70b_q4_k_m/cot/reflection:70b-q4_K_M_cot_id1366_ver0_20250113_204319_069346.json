    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information, assign a relative weight to each risk factor, and then use these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors from the provided information.\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each identified risk factor.\n3. Explain the reasoning behind each assigned weight.\n4. Collectively consider these weighted risk factors to make a prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n5. Estimate confidence in the prediction.\n\nLet's go through this process:\n\n1. Identified risk factors:\n   - Gender (female)\n   - Marital status (never married, not cohabiting)\n   - Employment history (held 4 jobs)\n   - Household size (4)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assigning weights and explanations:\n\n   a) Gender: low\n      Reasoning: While gender can be a factor in criminal justice outcomes, it is generally considered less influential than other factors in predicting recidivism.\n\n   b) Marital status: medium\n      Reasoning: Being never married or not cohabiting may indicate some level of social isolation or lack of strong family ties, which could contribute to higher recidivism risk. However, this factor alone is not as strongly correlated with recidivism as other factors might be.\n\n   c) Employment history: high\n      Reasoning: Having held four jobs suggests instability in employment, which can indicate difficulties with commitment, impulse control, or coping skills. This is a strong predictor of potential recidivism risk.\n\n   d) Household size: low\n      Reasoning: A household size of 4 is relatively average and not indicative of unusual stressors that might increase recidivism risk.\n\n   e) Family structure at age 12: medium\n      Reasoning: Living with only a biological mother whose marital status was unknown could indicate some level of family instability. This can have long-term effects on a person's stability and decision-making, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\n\n3. Collectively considering these weighted factors:\n   - We have one low-risk factor (gender)\n   - Two medium-risk factors (marital status and family structure at age 12)\n   - One high-risk factor (employment history)\n   - One neutral factor (household size)\n\n4. Prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, I would predict that this individual is likely to be rearrested within three years.\n\n5. Confidence:\n   Given the mixed risk factors and lack of information about criminal history or specific behaviors leading to arrest, confidence should be moderate.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. However, it's important to note that this prediction is based on limited information and should be considered alongside other assessments for a more accurate picture. The high-risk employment factor stands out as particularly concerning in terms of potential recidivism risk.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"While gender can be a factor in criminal justice outcomes, it is generally considered less influential than other factors in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (never married, not cohabiting)\", \"medium\", \"This may indicate some level of social isolation or lack of strong family ties, which could contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment history (held 4 jobs)\", \"high\", \"This suggests instability in employment, which can indicate difficulties with commitment, impulse control, or coping skills.\"),\n    (\"Household size (4)\", \"low\", \"A household size of 4 is relatively average and not indicative of unusual stressors that might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12 (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\", \"medium\", \"This could indicate some level of family instability, which can have long-term effects on a person's stability and decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\n</output>",
