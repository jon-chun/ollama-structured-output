    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided about the individual and assess its potential impact on recidivism risk. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Gender: Female\n2. Marital status: Married with spouse present\n3. Employment status: Currently unemployed\n4. Household size: 4 people\n5. Family history: Lived with biological mother at age 12, marital status of parents unknown\n\nNow, let's evaluate each factor and assign a relative weight:\n\n1. Gender (Female):\n   - Risk factor: Low\n   - Reasoning: Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n\n2. Marital status (Married with spouse present):\n   - Risk factor: Low\n   - Reasoning: Stable marital relationships can provide support and reduce criminal behavior.\n\n3. Employment status (Currently unemployed):\n   - Risk factor: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Unemployment can increase stress and economic instability, potentially leading to criminal activity. However, it's not always a strong predictor on its own.\n\n4. Household size (4 people):\n   - Risk factor: Low\n   - Reasoning: A medium-sized household suggests some level of stability and support network.\n\n5. Family history:\n   - Risk factor: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Living with only the biological mother at age 12, with unknown parental marital status, might indicate a less stable childhood environment. This can be a risk factor for future criminal behavior.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, these assessments seem reasonable based on general criminological research. However, it's important to note that individual circumstances can vary greatly, and some factors may interact in complex ways. The weights assigned should be considered as part of a holistic assessment rather than standalone predictors.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's consider the overall prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\nBased on these factors, the overall risk appears to be relatively low. However, the presence of medium-risk factors (unemployment and family history) means we can't rule out the possibility entirely.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter reviewing the analysis, I believe the final prediction should be \"NO\" for rearrest recidivism within 3 years. This is because the majority of factors lean towards a lower risk profile. However, given the presence of some medium-risk elements, our confidence shouldn't be too high.\n</reflection>\n\nFinal assessment:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (Female)\", \"low\", \"Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (Married with spouse present)\", \"low\", \"Stable marital relationships can provide support and reduce criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment status (Currently unemployed)\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can increase stress and economic instability, potentially leading to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Household size (4 people)\", \"low\", \"A medium-sized household suggests some level of stability and support network.\"),\n    (\"Family history\", \"medium\", \"Living with only the biological mother at age 12, with unknown parental marital status, might indicate a less stable childhood environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis prediction indicates that based on these factors, it's unlikely this person will be rearrested within 3 years. The confidence level of 70% reflects the presence of some medium-risk factors, which prevents us from being overly confident in our assessment.\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (Female)\", \"low\", \"Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (Married with spouse present)\", \"low\", \"Stable marital relationships can provide support and reduce criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment status (Currently unemployed)\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can increase stress and economic instability, potentially leading to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Household size (4 people)\", \"low\", \"A medium-sized household suggests some level of stability and support network.\"),\n    (\"Family history\", \"medium\", \"Living with only the biological mother at age 12, with unknown parental marital status, might indicate a less stable childhood environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
