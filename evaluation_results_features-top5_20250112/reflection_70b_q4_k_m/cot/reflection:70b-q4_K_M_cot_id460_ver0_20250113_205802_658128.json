    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each factor mentioned in the prompt and assign a risk level (low, medium, high) based on their potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's break down the given information:\n1. Male\n2. Never married\n3. Cohabiting\n4. Held 4 jobs\n5. Household size of 6\n6. Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Gender: Male\n   - Risk level: Medium to High\n   - Reasoning: Males are generally considered a higher risk for recidivism than females.\n\n2. Marital Status: Never married\n   - Risk level: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Being never married can indicate less stability and fewer social ties, which are protective factors against criminal behavior.\n\n3. Cohabiting:\n   - Risk level: Low to Medium\n   - Reasoning: While cohabiting doesn't offer the same stability as marriage, it does provide some form of partnership and potentially more stable living conditions.\n\n4. Job History: Held 4 jobs\n   - Risk level: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Multiple job changes can indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism.\n\n5. Household Size: 6\n   - Risk level: Low to Medium\n   - Reasoning: A larger household size can provide more social support but also potentially increase stress and financial strain.\n\n6. Family Background: Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n   - Risk level: High\n   - Reasoning: An unstable or potentially single-parent household in childhood is associated with higher risk for criminal behavior later in life.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter analyzing each factor, I believe the assessment is comprehensive. However, to ensure accuracy and consistency, let's double-check if we've considered all aspects:\n\n1. We have addressed all given factors.\n2. The reasoning behind each factor aligns with general criminological research findings.\n3. No major factors seem to be overlooked.\n\nThe analysis appears thorough and well-reasoned based on common risk assessment principles in criminal justice.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\nPrediction: YES\nConfidence: 70%\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level of 70% seems appropriate. The combination of factors such as male gender, never married status, unstable job history, and potentially unstable childhood environment outweighs the relatively stable current living situation (cohabiting, larger household). While no single factor is extremely high-risk on its own, the cumulative effect suggests an increased likelihood of recidivism.\n\nThe 70% confidence level reflects that while there are significant risk factors present, there's still some uncertainty due to factors like cohabitation and a relatively large household size that might provide some protective effects.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"Medium to High\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"Medium\", \"Lack of marital stability can be associated with less social support and potentially more risk for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting\", \"Low to Medium\", \"While not as stable as marriage, cohabitation provides some level of partnership and household stability.\"),\n    (\"Held 4 jobs\", \"Medium\", \"Multiple job changes may indicate employment instability or difficulty maintaining work relationships.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 6\", \"Low to Medium\", \"A larger household can provide more social support but also potentially increase stress and financial strain.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\", \"High\", \"Unstable family environments in childhood are associated with higher risk for later criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis assessment takes into account various factors from the individual's background and current situation. The combination of these factors suggests an increased likelihood of recidivism over a three-year period.\n\nThe key risk factors include male gender, never having been married, job instability (having held four different jobs), and a potentially unstable childhood environment. While cohabiting and living in a larger household might provide some stability and social support, they don't outweigh the cumulative effect of the higher-risk factors.\n\nThe confidence level of 70% reflects that while there are significant risk factors present, the prediction isn't without uncertainty. The presence of some stable elements in their current life situation (cohabitation and a large household) suggests that the individual might have some protective factors against recidivism, but these are outweighed by the more concerning historical and demographic factors.\n\nThis assessment should be used as one component of a comprehensive risk evaluation, considering other aspects such as criminal history, education level, substance abuse issues, and any recent behavioral changes.\n</output>",
