    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each risk factor provided and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) based on their potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism and provide a confidence level. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyze each risk factor:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held only 1 job\n   - Household size of 4\n   - Lived with other adults at age 12\n   - Unknown biological parent status\n\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each factor based on their potential impact on recidivism:\n\n   a) Male gender: Medium (Males have higher recidivism rates than females)\n   b) Never married: High (Stable relationships can be protective factors against crime)\n   c) Not cohabiting: High (Similar to never married, stable partnerships often reduce criminal behavior)\n   d) Held only 1 job: Medium (Employment history is a significant factor in recidivism risk; holding few jobs may indicate instability)\n   e) Household size of 4: Low (This seems relatively normal and doesn't stand out as an increased risk factor)\n   f) Lived with other adults at age 12: Low (While potentially indicating some family instability, it's not a strong predictor by itself)\n   g) Unknown biological parent status: Medium (Lack of information about parental involvement could be concerning)\n\n3. Collectively assess these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the individual has several high-risk factors (never married, not cohabiting, held only 1 job) and some medium-risk factors (male gender, unknown biological parent status). The low-risk factors (household size of 4, living with other adults at age 12) don't seem to outweigh these. This suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n4. Determine the confidence level:\n\nGiven the combination of high-risk factors and limited protective factors, I would assign a moderate to high confidence level, around 70%.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Stable relationships often act as protective factors against criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"high\", \"Similar to never married, stable partnerships can reduce criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"Held only 1 job\", \"medium\", \"Employment history is significant in recidivism risk; few jobs may indicate instability\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"low\", \"This household size appears relatively normal and doesn't stand out as a risk factor\"),\n    (\"Lived with other adults at age 12\", \"low\", \"While potentially indicating some family instability, it's not a strong predictor by itself\"),\n    (\"Unknown biological parent status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of information about parental involvement could be concerning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
