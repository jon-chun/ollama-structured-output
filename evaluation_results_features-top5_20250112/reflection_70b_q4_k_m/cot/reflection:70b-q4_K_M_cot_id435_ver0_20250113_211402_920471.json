    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to carefully analyze each factor and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) along with reasoning. Then, I'll use these weighted factors to make an overall prediction about the likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Male gender\n2. Never married\n3. Not cohabiting\n4. Currently unemployed\n5. Household size: 14\n6. Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown)\n\nNow, let's analyze each factor and assign a weight:\n\n1. Male gender:\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: While males are generally more likely to be involved in criminal activity than females, this alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\n2. Never married:\n   Weight: High\n   Reasoning: Studies have shown that marital status can be a significant factor in reducing recidivism rates. Being never married may indicate a lack of stable relationships and social support.\n\n3. Not cohabiting:\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: Similar to marital status, living with a partner (cohabiting) is often associated with lower recidivism rates. However, this factor alone might not be as strong as the marital status factor.\n\n4. Currently unemployed:\n   Weight: High\n   Reasoning: Unemployment has consistently been shown to increase the risk of recidivism. Lack of employment can lead to financial instability and increased stress levels.\n\n5. Household size: 14\n   Weight: Low\n   Reasoning: While large household sizes might indicate some level of social support, this factor alone is not strongly correlated with recidivism rates compared to other factors mentioned.\n\n6. Lived with biological mother at age 12 (marital status unknown):\n   Weight: Medium\n   Reasoning: This could indicate a stable family environment in childhood. However, the lack of information about the father's presence or marital status reduces its predictive power.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive and balanced. I've considered each factor's potential impact on recidivism based on general knowledge of risk factors. The weights assigned seem appropriate given the context provided. However, it's important to note that a more precise prediction would require additional information about the individual's past criminal history, current circumstances, and any interventions or support systems in place.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's combine these weighted factors to make an overall prediction:\n\nPrediction: YES\nConfidence: 85%\n\nThe high weights assigned to never married status and unemployment are significant predictors of recidivism. The medium weights for male gender, not cohabiting, and family situation at age 12 also contribute to the risk profile. While the large household size is less predictive, it doesn't counteract the other risk factors.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"medium\", \"While males are generally more likely to be involved in criminal activity than females, this alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Studies have shown that marital status can be a significant factor in reducing recidivism rates.
