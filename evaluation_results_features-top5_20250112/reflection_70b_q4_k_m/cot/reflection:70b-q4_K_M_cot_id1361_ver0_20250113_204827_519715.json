    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze each piece of information provided and assess its impact on recidivism risk. Then, I'll use these factors to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each factor:\n   - Male gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Currently unemployed\n   - Household size of 7 at the time of assessment\n   - Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12\n\n2. Assign a relative weight to each factor (low, medium, high) based on criminological research and risk assessment principles.\n\n3. Provide textual reasoning for each factor's assigned weight.\n\n4. Use these weighted factors to make a collective prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n5. Determine the confidence level of this prediction.\n\nLet's go through each factor:\n\n1. Male gender: High - Men are generally at higher risk of recidivism than women.\n2. Never married: Medium - While not being married doesn't directly increase criminal behavior, it can be associated with less stable family support.\n3. Not cohabiting: Low - This factor alone doesn't significantly impact recidivism risk.\n4. Currently unemployed: High - Unemployment is strongly linked to increased crime rates and recidivism.\n5. Household size of 7: Medium - Larger households can sometimes lead to more complex dynamics, but the effect on recidivism is less clear-cut.\n6. Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12: Medium - This indicates potential family instability in childhood, which can be a risk factor for future criminal behavior.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, these assessments seem reasonable based on criminological research. However, I should consider the cumulative effect of multiple factors and how they might interact. For example, being unemployed and having a large household size could compound each other's negative effects.\n</reflection>\n\nAfter considering all factors collectively:\n\nPrediction: YES (the person is likely to be rearrested within 3 years)\nConfidence: 70%\n\n<reflection>\nThe prediction of \"YES\" seems appropriate given the presence of several high-risk factors (male gender, unemployment) and multiple medium-risk factors. The confidence level of 70% reflects the moderate to high risk profile but also acknowledges that recidivism is never certain.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male gender\", \"high\", \"Men are generally at higher risk of recidivism than women, as they tend to engage in more criminal behavior and have higher rates of substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"While not being married doesn't directly increase criminal behavior, it can be associated with less stable family support, which is an important factor in rehabilitation and maintaining law-abiding behavior.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"This factor alone doesn't significantly impact recidivism risk.
