    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given factors and their potential impact on recidivism risk. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors:\n   - Female gender\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Employment history (held 1 job)\n   - Household size (4 people)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (lived with biological dad, unknown marital status)\n\n2. Evaluate each factor's potential impact on recidivism:\n   a) Female gender: Generally considered lower risk\n   b) Never married: Could indicate instability or lack of support system\n   c) Not cohabiting: Similar to never married, could suggest lack of stable relationships\n   d) Employment history (1 job): Limited work experience might be seen as higher risk\n   e) Household size (4 people): Large household can be stressful and potentially destabilizing\n   f) Family structure at age 12: Living with a single parent or unstable home environment\n\n3. Assign relative weights based on the evaluation:\n   a) Female gender: Low risk\n   b) Never married: Medium risk\n   c) Not cohabiting: Medium risk\n   d) Employment history (1 job): High risk\n   e) Household size (4 people): Medium risk\n   f) Family structure at age 12: High risk\n\n4. Consider the collective impact:\n   - There are more medium and high-risk factors than low ones.\n   - The combination of limited work experience, lack of stable relationships, and potentially unstable childhood environment could significantly increase recidivism risk.\n\n5. Make a prediction based on the analysis:\n   Given the preponderance of medium to high-risk factors, it's likely that this person would be at higher risk for recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I believe my analysis is comprehensive and well-reasoned. However, I should note that while female gender is generally considered a lower risk factor, the other elements in this individual's profile may mitigate its positive impact. Additionally, it's important to remember that these factors don't guarantee recidivism, but rather increase the likelihood.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's formulate the JSON response:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"Generally considered lower risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"May indicate instability or lack of support system\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Similar to never married, could suggest lack of stable relationships\"),\n    (\"Employment history (1 job)\", \"high\", \"Limited work experience may be seen as higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size (4 people)\", \"medium\", \"Large household can be stressful and potentially destabilizing\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12\", \"high\", \"Living with a single parent or unstable home environment\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n<reflection>\nAfter final review, I believe this response accurately reflects the analysis. The risk factors are properly weighted and explained, the prediction is aligned with the overall assessment, and the confidence level of 80% indicates a strong likelihood of recidivism while acknowledging some uncertainty in these predictions.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Female gender\", \"low\", \"Generally considered lower risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"May indicate instability or lack of support system\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Similar to never married, could suggest lack of stable relationships\"),\n    (\"Employment history (1 job)\", \"high\", \"Limited work experience may be seen as higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size (4 people)\", \"medium\", \"Large household can be stressful and potentially destabilizing\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12\", \"high\", \"Living with a single parent or unstable home environment\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
