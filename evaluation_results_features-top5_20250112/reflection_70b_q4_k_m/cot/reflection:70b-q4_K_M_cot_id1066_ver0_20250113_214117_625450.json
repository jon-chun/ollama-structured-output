    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information about the individual and assess various risk factors that could influence recidivism. Then, I'll use these assessments to predict whether the person is likely to be rearrested within three years. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify potential risk factors from the given information:\n   - Gender (male)\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Cohabitation status (not cohabiting)\n   - Employment status (unemployed)\n   - Household size (3)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Evaluate each risk factor:\n   a) Gender: Male\n      Risk level: Medium\n      Reasoning: Males have higher recidivism rates than females\n\n   b) Marital status: Never married\n      Risk level: High\n      Reasoning: Unmarried individuals often lack stability and social support\n\n   c) Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\n      Risk level: High\n      Reasoning: Lack of a stable partner may indicate instability or antisocial behavior\n\n   d) Employment status: Unemployed\n      Risk level: High\n      Reasoning: Joblessness can lead to financial strain and increased likelihood of criminal activity\n\n   e) Household size: 3\n      Risk level: Low\n      Reasoning: Moderate household size doesn't strongly indicate higher risk\n\n   f) Family structure at age 12: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown\n      Risk level: Medium\n      Reasoning: Uncertainty about parental relationships could indicate some family instability\n\n3. Summarize the risk factors:\n   - High-risk factors: Marital status (never married), cohabitation status, employment status\n   - Medium-risk factors: Gender, family structure at age 12\n   - Low-risk factor: Household size\n\n4. Predict recidivism based on these factors:\n   Given multiple high-risk factors and the overall profile, it's likely that this person will be rearrested within three years.\n\n5. Assign confidence level:\n   Based on the combination of risk factors, especially the prevalence of high-risk indicators, I would assign a confidence level of 80%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive and balanced. The identified risk factors align with established criminological theories and research findings. However, it's worth noting that no information about past criminal history or specific circumstances leading to current arrest was provided. In real-world assessments, this information would be crucial in making more accurate predictions.\n\nGiven the constraints of the task, our analysis should stand as a reasonable assessment based on the available data.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \"Unmarried individuals often lack stability and social support\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"high\", \"Lack of a stable partner may indicate instability or antisocial behavior\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Joblessness can lead to financial strain and increased likelihood of criminal activity\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Moderate household size doesn't strongly indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Uncertainty about parental relationships could indicate some family instability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n</output>",
