    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze the given information about the individual and assign a risk factor weight for each piece of data. Then, I'll use these factors to predict whether she will be rearrested within 3 years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant information:\n   - Female\n   - Never married\n   - Not cohabiting\n   - Held only 1 job\n   - Household size of 7\n   - Lived with biological mother at age 12\n   - Mother's marital status unknown\n\n2. Assign a risk factor weight (low, medium, high) to each piece of information:\n\na) Gender: Female (Low risk)\nb) Marital status: Never married (Medium risk)\nc) Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting (High risk)\nd) Employment history: Held only 1 job (Medium risk)\ne) Household size: 7 (High risk)\nf) Family structure at age 12: Lived with biological mother, unknown marital status (High risk)\n\n3. Analyze the overall picture:\n   - Several factors indicate higher risk\n   - No strong protective factors mentioned\n\n4. Predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n   Based on these factors, it appears more likely than not that she will be rearrested within 3 years.\n\n5. Determine confidence level:\n   Given multiple high-risk factors and no clearly mitigating circumstances, I'll assign a moderate to high confidence level.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive and considers all provided information. The risk factor assignments are based on general criminological knowledge:\n\n- Females tend to have lower recidivism rates than males\n- Never being married is often associated with higher recidivism\n- Lack of cohabitation can indicate instability\n- Limited employment history suggests potential for instability or lack of skills\n- Large household size can be a stress factor and potentially increase risk\n- Unstable family structure in childhood is often linked to increased adult criminality\n\nThe prediction and confidence level seem appropriate based on these factors. However, it's important to note that this is a simplified assessment and real-world evaluations would require much more information.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender tends to be associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married can indicate lack of social support and potentially higher stress levels, which may increase criminal risk\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"high\", \"Not cohabiting may suggest unstable relationships or a lack of stable living arrangements, both of which are associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job suggests limited work experience and potentially unstable employment situations, which can contribute to increased criminal risk\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"high\", \"A household size of 7 indicates a potentially stressful home environment, which may increase the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12\", \"high\", \"Living with only a biological mother whose marital status is unknown suggests potential instability in early life, which can be linked to higher adult recidivism rates\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis risk assessment considers multiple factors that contribute to the individual's likelihood of rearrest within 3 years. The prediction is based on a combination of high-risk indicators such as unstable relationships, limited employment history, large household size, and potentially unstable childhood environment.\n\nThe confidence level of 80% reflects the presence of several strong risk factors, with no clearly mitigating circumstances mentioned in the provided information. However, it's important to note that real-world assessments would require a much more comprehensive set of data to provide an accurate prediction.\n</output>",
