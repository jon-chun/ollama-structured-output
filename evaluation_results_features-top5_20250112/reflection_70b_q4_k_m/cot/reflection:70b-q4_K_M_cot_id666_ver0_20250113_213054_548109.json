    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information about the individual's background and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for predicting 3-year rearrest recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to make a prediction about whether the person will be rearrested within three years.\n\nLet's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors from the given information.\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its potential impact on recidivism.\n3. Provide textual reasoning for each factor.\n4. Collectively analyze these factors to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n5. Determine the confidence level of this prediction.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Relevant risk factors:\n   - Gender (male)\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Cohabitation status (not cohabiting)\n   - Employment status (unemployed)\n   - Household size (4 people)\n   - Family structure at age 12 (lived with both biological parents)\n\n2. Assigning weights and reasoning:\n\n   a) Gender: male\n      Weight: Medium\n      Reasoning: Research suggests that males are generally more likely to be rearrested than females, but this factor alone is not strongly predictive.\n\n   b) Marital status: never married\n      Weight: High\n      Reasoning: Studies have shown that unmarried individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates compared to those who are married. This lack of stable partnership may contribute to instability in life.\n\n   c) Cohabitation status: not cohabiting\n      Weight: Medium\n      Reasoning: Not living with a partner can indicate less social support and stability, potentially increasing the risk for recidivism.\n\n   d) Employment status: unemployed\n      Weight: High\n      Reasoning: Unemployment is strongly linked to increased recidivism rates. Lack of employment often leads to financial instability and reduced opportunities for positive engagement in society.\n\n   e) Household size: 4 people\n      Weight: Low\n      Reasoning: While a larger household can sometimes be associated with less individual attention, the moderate size of this household doesn't strongly indicate increased risk or support for recidivism.\n\n   f) Family structure at age 12: lived with both biological parents\n      Weight: Low\n      Reasoning: Having both biological parents present during adolescence is generally considered a positive factor in personal development and social stability, potentially reducing the risk of recidivism.\n\n3. Prediction based on collective analysis:\nThe high-risk factors (never married, unemployed) outweigh the medium- and low-risk factors. However, the presence of some stable family history (lived with both biological parents at age 12) suggests there may be some resilience present.\n\nPrediction: YES (the person is likely to be rearrested within three years)\n\nConfidence level: 70%\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. The weights assigned to each factor align with general research findings in criminal justice risk assessment. The prediction of \"YES\" for recidivism is based on the significant impact of being unmarried and unemployed, which are known strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nThe confidence level of 70% reflects that while there are substantial risk factors present, there's still some uncertainty due to the presence of a stable family background in adolescence. This moderate-high confidence acknowledges both the clear indicators of increased risk and the potential for individual variations.\n\nThis analysis appears to provide a balanced and well-supported prediction based on the given information.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: male\", \"Medium\", \"Research suggests that males are generally more likely to be rearrested than females, but this factor alone is not strongly predictive.\"),\n    (\"Marital status: never married\", \"High\", \"Studies have shown that unmarried individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates compared to those who are married.

The most significant contributors to this prediction are being never married and currently unemployed, both of which are strongly associated with increased recidivism rates in criminal justice research.\n\nThe presence of a stable family structure during adolescence (living with both biological parents at age 12) is seen as a positive factor that might help mitigate some risk. However, this alone does not outweigh the substantial risks presented by marital status and employment status.\n\nIt's important to note that while these factors indicate an increased likelihood of recidivism, there are always individual variations and other unmeasured factors at play in real-world scenarios. The confidence level is set at 70%, reflecting both the clear indicators of risk present and the potential for unique circumstances or interventions that could alter this predicted outcome.\n\n</output>",
