    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided and determine its relevance to criminal risk assessment. Then, I'll assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on their potential impact on recidivism rates. Finally, I'll use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. Male\n2. Never married\n3. Cohabiting\n4. Held 1 job\n5. Household size of 4\n6. Lived with biological mother at age 12, other parent present\n\nNow, I'll analyze each factor and assign a weight along with a brief explanation:\n\n1. Gender (Male): Medium risk - Studies show males have higher recidivism rates than females.\n2. Marital status (Never married): High risk - Lack of stable relationships often correlates with higher criminal behavior.\n3. Cohabitation: Low risk - Stable living arrangements can be protective against recidivism.\n4. Employment history (1 job): Medium risk - Limited work experience may indicate instability or difficulties in maintaining employment.\n5. Household size (4): Medium risk - Larger household sizes can lead to increased stress and instability.\n6. Family structure at age 12: Low risk - Presence of both biological parents is generally considered a positive factor.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, my analysis seems comprehensive. However, I should consider the combination of factors rather than just individual elements. For instance, while never being married might be high risk on its own, the fact that this person is currently cohabiting could mitigate some of that risk.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's collectively use these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering all factors together:\n- Positive factors: Cohabitation and presence of both parents at age 12\n- Negative factors: Never married, limited employment history\n- Neutral/mixed factors: Male gender, household size\n\nThe overall risk appears to be medium. While there are some positive indicators, the lack of stable relationships and limited work experience raise concerns about long-term stability.\n\nPrediction: NO (meaning no rearrest is predicted)\nConfidence: 70%\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender (Male)\", \"medium\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates than females, but this alone doesn't strongly predict rearrest\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable long-term relationships often correlates with increased criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Stable living arrangements can be protective against recidivism and may indicate some level of responsibility\"),\n    (\"Employment history (1 job)\", \"medium\", \"Limited work experience may indicate instability or difficulties in maintaining employment, which could contribute to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Household size (4)\", \"medium\", \"Larger household sizes can lead to increased stress and instability, potentially affecting behavior and decision-making\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12\", \"low\", \"Presence of both biological parents is generally considered a positive factor in reducing criminal risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
