    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each risk factor for a 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction based on the given information. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors from the given information.\n2. Evaluate each factor and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high).\n3. Use these weights collectively to make a prediction.\n\nLet's go through the factors:\n\n1. Gender: Male\n2. Marital status: Never married\n3. Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\n4. Employment history: Held 1 job\n5. Household size: 5 people\n6. Family structure at age 12: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown\n\nNow, let's evaluate each factor:\n\n1. Gender: Male - High risk (Research shows higher recidivism rates in males)\n2. Marital status: Never married - Medium risk (Unmarried individuals may have less social stability)\n3. Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting - Medium risk (Similar to marital status, lack of cohabitation may indicate instability)\n4. Employment history: Held 1 job - Low risk (Having held a job indicates some level of responsibility and employability)\n5. Household size: 5 people - High risk (Large household sizes can be associated with more chaotic environments)\n6. Family structure at age 12: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown - Medium risk (Unknown parental marital status may indicate instability in the home)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive and considers all provided factors. However, I should also consider the cumulative effect of these factors when making the final prediction.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's use these weights collectively to make a prediction:\n\nThe majority of factors point towards higher risk (4 out of 6 are medium or high). The presence of multiple medium and high-risk factors outweighs the single low-risk factor. This suggests that there is likely an increased risk for rearrest recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nThis conclusion seems logical based on the analysis. However, I should quantify this in a prediction with confidence level.\n</reflection>\n\nPrediction: YES (the individual is likely to be rearrested within 3 years)\nConfidence: 70%\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Research shows higher recidivism rates in males\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried individuals may have less social stability\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of cohabitation may indicate instability and lack of support system\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Having held a job indicates some level of responsibility and employability\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"high\", \"Large household sizes can be associated with more chaotic environments potentially leading to increased stress and conflict\"),\n    (\"Family structure at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Unknown parental marital status may indicate instability in the home, potentially affecting childhood development\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
