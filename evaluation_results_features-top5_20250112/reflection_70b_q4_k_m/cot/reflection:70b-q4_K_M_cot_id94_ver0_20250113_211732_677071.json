    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information given about the individual and assess its potential impact on criminal risk. Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant factors from the given information.\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its potential contribution to recidivism risk.\n3. Provide textual reasoning for each assignment.\n4. Collectively consider all factors to make a 3-year rearrest prediction.\n5. Determine the confidence level of this prediction.\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n1. Relevant factors:\n   - Gender (male)\n   - Marital status (never married, not cohabiting)\n   - Employment status (unemployed)\n   - Household size (3)\n   - Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assigning weights and reasoning:\n\na) Gender: Male\nWeight: Medium\nReasoning: Research suggests males are more likely to be involved in criminal activity than females, but this is a broad demographic factor.\n\nb) Marital Status: Never married, not cohabiting\nWeight: Medium\nReasoning: Lack of stable relationships can indicate social isolation or instability, which may increase risk factors for recidivism.\n\nc) Employment Status: Unemployed\nWeight: High\nReasoning: Unemployment is strongly associated with increased likelihood of criminal behavior and recidivism due to lack of financial stability and purpose.\n\nd) Household Size: 3\nWeight: Low\nReasoning: This factor alone doesn't provide strong evidence for or against increased risk. It could indicate a supportive environment but also potential stressors.\n\ne) Living Situation at Age 12: With biological mother, marital status unknown\nWeight: Medium\nReasoning: An uncertain family structure during adolescence can be associated with higher risk factors due to potentially less stable upbringing.\n\n3. Collectively considering all factors:\nThe combination of being unemployed (high risk), male (medium risk), never married/not cohabiting (medium risk), and an uncertain living situation in adolescence (medium risk) suggests a higher overall risk for recidivism.\n\n4. Prediction:\nBased on these factors, I would predict YES to the likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n\n5. Confidence level:\nGiven the combination of medium and high-risk factors, especially with unemployment being such a strong predictor, I would place my confidence at about 75%.\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing this analysis, it appears comprehensive and well-reasoned. The weights assigned to each factor are based on established criminological research principles. The prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest within 3 years aligns with the overall risk profile presented by these factors. However, I should double-check if there's any information that might mitigate this risk or if I've overlooked any potential protective factors.\n</reflection>\n\nAfter reflection, I believe the analysis is robust and accurately represents the information provided. There are no obvious mitigating factors in the given data that would significantly alter the assessment.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"medium\", \"Research suggests males are more likely to be involved in criminal activity than females, but this is a broad demographic factor.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status: Never married, not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable relationships can indicate social isolation or instability, which may increase risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status: Unemployed\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is strongly associated with increased likelihood of criminal behavior and recidivism due to lack of financial stability and purpose.\"),\n    (\"Household Size: 3\", \"low\", \"This factor alone doesn't provide strong evidence for or against increased risk.

The unemployed status stands out as a particularly strong predictor for recidivism, which significantly influences the overall prediction.\n\n</output>",
