    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze the given information, assign weights to each risk factor, and then use these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors from the given information:\n   - Gender: Male\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\n   - Employment status: Unemployed\n   - Household size: 5\n   - Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown\n\n2. Assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their potential impact on recidivism:\n   a) Male gender: Medium risk (males are generally more likely to be involved in criminal activity)\n   b) Never married: High risk (lack of stable family ties)\n   c) Not cohabiting: Medium risk (reduced social support and accountability)\n   d) Unemployed: High risk (financial stress, lack of structure)\n   e) Household size 5: Low risk (larger household may indicate more support)\n   f) Living with biological mother at age 12: Medium risk (potential instability or single-parent household)\n\n3. Analyze the cumulative effect of these factors on recidivism risk:\n   - High-risk factors: Never married, unemployed\n   - Medium-risk factors: Male gender, not cohabiting, living situation at age 12\n   - Low-risk factor: Household size\n\n4. Make a prediction based on the analysis:\n   Given the presence of multiple high and medium-risk factors, the overall risk seems elevated.\n\n5. Assign a confidence level to the prediction:\n   Based on the clear pattern of risk factors, I would assign a moderate to high confidence level (around 80%).\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this plan and analysis seem comprehensive. The identification of risk factors is thorough, and the assignment of weights appears reasonable based on general knowledge of criminal justice and social sciences. However, it's important to note that without specific statistical models or empirical data provided in the question, these assessments are based on general principles rather than exact probabilities.\n\nThe prediction leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest due to several significant risk factors (never married, unemployed) despite some potentially mitigating factors (larger household). The confidence level is set at 80% to reflect that while there's a clear pattern of elevated risk, individual outcomes can vary widely in criminal justice contexts.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender: Male\", \"medium\", \"Males are generally more likely to be involved in criminal activity and recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status: Never married\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable family ties often correlates with higher risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Reduced social support and accountability can contribute to elevated risk\"),\n    (\"Employment status: Unemployed\", \"high\", \"Financial stress and lack of structure are strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size: 5\", \"low\", \"Larger household may indicate more support, potentially mitigating some risks\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown\", \"medium\", \"Potential instability or single-parent household could influence long-term outcomes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n</output>",
