    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll develop a step-by-step plan to analyze each risk factor and then combine them for the prediction:\n\n1. Identify all relevant risk factors from the given information.\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on its impact on recidivism.\n3. Provide textual reasoning for each assigned weight.\n4. Combine the weighted risk factors to make an overall prediction of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n5. Calculate confidence in the prediction.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Identified risk factors:\n   - Gender (female)\n   - Marital status (never married)\n   - Cohabitation status (not cohabiting)\n   - Employment status (unemployed)\n   - Household size (6)\n   - Living situation at age 12 (with biological mother, marital status unknown)\n\n2. Assigning weights and providing reasoning:\n\n   a) Gender: low\n   Reasoning: While gender can be a factor in some crimes, it's generally considered less influential than other factors.\n\n   b) Marital status: medium\n   Reasoning: Being never married can sometimes indicate instability or lack of social support, but its impact varies widely among individuals.\n\n   c) Cohabitation status: low\n   Reasoning: Not cohabiting is often associated with marital status and doesn't significantly increase recidivism risk on its own.\n\n   d) Employment status: high\n   Reasoning: Unemployment is consistently shown to be a strong predictor of criminal behavior due to lack of structure, financial instability, and potential desperation.\n\n   e) Household size: medium\n   Reasoning: A large household can sometimes indicate stress or instability, but it's not typically a strong standalone risk factor for recidivism.\n\n   f) Living situation at age 12: high\n   Reasoning: An unstable living situation in childhood (unknown marital status of mother) is often associated with increased criminal behavior later in life due to lack of stability and potential adverse childhood experiences.\n\n3. Combining the weighted risk factors:\nThe strongest predictors here are unemployment and the unstable childhood living situation, both assigned as high-risk factors. These outweigh the lower risk factors.\n\n4. Overall prediction: YES\nBased on the presence of two significant risk factors (unemployment and unstable childhood) and several moderate risk factors, there is a higher likelihood of recidivism within 3 years.\n\n5. Confidence calculation:\nGiven the combination of high and medium-risk factors, I would estimate a confidence level of 75%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. The assignment of weights and the overall prediction align with established research in criminal justice risk assessment. However, it's important to note that real-world assessments would typically involve more specific data about past crimes, behavior patterns, and other factors not provided here. The confidence level might be slightly higher (80%) due to the clear presence of high-risk factors.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"While gender can influence some types of crime, it is generally considered less impactful than other factors in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Being never married may indicate instability or lack of social support, but its impact varies widely among individuals and is not typically a strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting often correlates with marital status and doesn't significantly increase recidivism risk independently.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is consistently shown to be a strong predictor of criminal behavior due to factors such as lack of structure, financial instability, and potential desperation.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium\", \"A large household can sometimes indicate stress or instability but isn't typically considered a strong standalone risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living situation at age 12\", \"high\", \"An unstable living situation in childhood (unknown marital status of mother) is often associated with increased criminal behavior later in life due to factors such as lack of stability and potential adverse childhood experiences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n</output>",
