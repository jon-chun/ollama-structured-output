    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n<reflection>\nLet me reflect on this analysis to ensure it's comprehensive and accurate.\n\nThe given risk factors include:\n1. Male gender: Generally associated with higher crime rates\n2. Never married, not cohabiting: Lack of stable relationships can be a risk factor\n3. Currently unemployed: Unemployment is often linked to increased criminal activity\n4. Household size of 4: Large family sizes can indicate economic stress or instability\n5. Lived with biological mother at age 12: Potential lack of male role model or parental stability\n\nThese factors collectively suggest a higher likelihood of risk, particularly for males in unstable or unsupported environments. The confidence level of 80% seems appropriate given the accumulation of these risk indicators.\n\nOne potential oversight could be the absence of information about education level, previous criminal history, and current living situation. However, based on the provided information alone, the prediction of \"YES\" for high risk with an 80% confidence appears to be a reasonable assessment.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\nBased on the analysis of the given risk factors, the prediction is that this individual indicates a high risk.\n\nThe confidence level in this assessment is 80%.\n\nThis conclusion is based on several key indicators:\n\n1. The individual is male, which statistically correlates with higher crime rates compared to females.\n2. Their marital status as never married and not cohabiting suggests a lack of stable relationships or support systems.\n3. Current unemployment is often associated with increased criminal activity due to financial stress or idleness.\n4. A household size of 4 may indicate economic strain or instability, which can contribute to risky behaviors.\n5. The individual's living situation at age 12, being with their biological mother whose marital status was unknown, suggests potential family instability or lack of a male role model.\n\nIt's important to note that while these factors collectively point towards a higher risk profile, they don't definitively determine an individual's behavior. Other factors not mentioned here, such as education level, previous criminal history, and current living situation, could also play significant roles in assessing overall risk.\n\nGiven the combination of these risk indicators, the assessment leans strongly towards indicating high risk, but with a slightly reduced confidence due to the absence of potentially mitigating or exacerbating factors.\n</output>",
