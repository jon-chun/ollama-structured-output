The individual is a never-married male, not cohabiting, which suggests potential social instability or lack of commitment. Holding only one job may indicate limited employment stability or opportunities. A larger household size (4 people) could suggest more strain on resources and potentially higher stress levels within the home environment. Living with both biological parents at age 12 could imply a lack of parental guidance or instability in the family unit. However, it's important to note that these factors alone do not definitively predict criminal behavior; they merely suggest an elevated risk profile. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 65.",
