However, the confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information available for assessment. Typically, being male does not inherently indicate high risk. Having held only one job could be a concern but without additional context like employment history or reasons for job change, it's hard to determine its significance. Living with both biological parents at age 12 might suggest stability, and a small household size could imply less strain on resources. The lack of marital or cohabitation status doesn't provide substantial risk indicators in this context.",
