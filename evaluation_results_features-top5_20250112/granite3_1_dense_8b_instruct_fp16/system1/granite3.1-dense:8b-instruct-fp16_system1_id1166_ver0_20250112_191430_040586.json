Being unmarried and never having cohabitated is not necessarily indicative of increased risk. Having held only one job could suggest instability, but without further context, this is not definitive. A household size of four implies social support, which can act as a protective factor against criminal behavior. Living with adoptive parents at age 12 suggests a stable family environment during crucial developmental years, also acting as a protective factor. Therefore, the overall risk is considered low to moderate.",
