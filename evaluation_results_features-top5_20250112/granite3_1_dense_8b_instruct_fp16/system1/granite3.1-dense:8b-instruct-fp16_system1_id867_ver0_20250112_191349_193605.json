However, being unmarried and having held multiple jobs can sometimes be associated with higher risk. The age of 12 indicates childhood, so the living situation at this age doesn't directly contribute to current adult risk. The household size of 4 is not particularly high or low. Therefore, the confidence in this prediction is moderate.",
