While being male, unmarried, and having held multiple jobs can sometimes be associated with higher risk, the absence of prior criminal history, stable family background (both biological parents), and living in a larger household size often suggest lower risk. The fact that he lived with his parents until age 12 also indicates stability and potential protection from negative influences. However, due to the limited information provided, the confidence level is moderate.",
