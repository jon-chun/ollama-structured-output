The individual is a female, never married, and does not cohabit, which can sometimes correlate with lower risk in certain contexts. She has held only one job, which might suggest financial instability but does not definitively indicate high risk. Her household size of five suggests she may have family support, which can be protective against some risks. Living with her biological mother could imply a nurturing environment during formative years. However, the lack of marital status information at age 12 and the limited job history make it difficult to definitively conclude high risk, hence the moderate confidence level.",
