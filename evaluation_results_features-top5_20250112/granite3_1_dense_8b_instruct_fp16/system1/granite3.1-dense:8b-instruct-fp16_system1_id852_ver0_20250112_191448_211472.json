Firstly, the individual is female and has never been married, which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males or those who have been divorced or separated. Secondly, she has held only 3 jobs, suggesting stability rather than frequent job changes that could indicate instability or unreliability. Lastly, living with her biological mother and having another parent present at age 12 suggests a stable family environment during crucial developmental years. However, it's important to note that while these factors suggest low risk, they do not guarantee it, hence the moderate confidence level.",
