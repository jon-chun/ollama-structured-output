Factors such as being married, having a spouse present, and living with family members (biological mother) generally indicate stability. However, the instability suggested by holding two jobs might offset these positive indicators to some extent. The age at which she lived with her biological mother (12 years old) is also not conclusive in determining current risk factors. Therefore, a \"NO\" prediction is made with a confidence level of 60%.",
