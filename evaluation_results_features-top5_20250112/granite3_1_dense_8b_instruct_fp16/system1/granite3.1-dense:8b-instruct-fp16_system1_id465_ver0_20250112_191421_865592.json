Firstly, the person's gender (female) and marital status (never married, not cohabiting) do not inherently suggest high risk. Secondly, having held only two jobs might imply stability rather than instability. The household size of three suggests a level of social support, which can be a protective factor against certain risks. Living with other adults could also indicate a level of supervision and support. However, the biological parent status is unknown and not having lived in group quarters at age 12 does not provide significant risk indicators. The confidence level is set to 60 due to the limited information provided.",
