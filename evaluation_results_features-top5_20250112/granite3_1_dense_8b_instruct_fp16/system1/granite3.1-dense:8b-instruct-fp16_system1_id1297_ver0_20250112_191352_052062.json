While unemployment can be a potential factor in some cases, the presence of a supportive spouse and a stable family environment (household size of 4) are generally associated with lower risk. The fact that she lived with her family at age 12 further suggests stability and social support, which typically correlate with lower risk. However, without additional context or specific crime types, the confidence in this prediction is moderate.",
