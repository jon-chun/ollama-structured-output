Being unmarried and having held multiple jobs could suggest instability, but without further context such as criminal history or substance abuse issues, it's difficult to definitively label this individual as high-risk. The fact that the person lived with their biological mother until age 12 might suggest some level of stability and familial support, which could lower the risk. However, the confidence in this prediction is relatively low due to the limited information provided.",
