The individual is a male, which some studies suggest may be associated with higher crime rates, but this factor alone does not guarantee high risk. He has never been married or cohabiting, which could imply stability rather than instability. Having held only one job might indicate limited work experience and potentially economic strain, but it is not definitively indicative of high risk. The household size of four suggests a family context, which often provides support and structure. Living with both biological parents at age 12 could imply a stable upbringing, although this information alone cannot rule out all potential risks. Overall, based on these factors, the prediction is that this individual does not present a high risk for criminal behavior, with a confidence level of approximately 65%.",
