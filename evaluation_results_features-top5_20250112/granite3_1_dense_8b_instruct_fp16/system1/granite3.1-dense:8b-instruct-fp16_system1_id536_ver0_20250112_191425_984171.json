While being female, never married, and not cohabiting could potentially suggest a higher risk in certain contexts (e.g., criminal behavior), the individual's employment history (3 jobs) is not indicative of high-risk behavior. Living with both biological parents at age 12 suggests a stable upbringing. The household size of 4 indicates social support, which can be protective against risk factors. Therefore, based on these factors alone, the prediction is \"NO\", with a confidence level of 60%.",
