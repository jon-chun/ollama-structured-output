However, the confidence level is relatively low due to limited information about past offenses or risky behaviors. Factors such as gender (male), marital status (never married, not cohabiting), number of jobs held, household size (3), and having lived with adoptive parents at age 12 do not directly correlate with a high risk for criminal behavior without additional context.",
