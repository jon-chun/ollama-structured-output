Being never married, not cohabiting, and holding only one job in the past are not typically associated with increased crime rates. Having both biological parents at age 12 could potentially suggest a stable upbringing, which may decrease risk. However, without additional factors such as criminal history, substance abuse, or association with deviant peers, it is difficult to definitively classify this individual as high-risk. The confidence level is set at 60 due to the lack of clear high-risk indicators in the provided information.",
