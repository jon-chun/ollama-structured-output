While being unmarried and having held multiple jobs can sometimes be associated with higher risk, the lack of other known risk factors such as a history of substance abuse, criminal record, or association with deviant peers, along with a stable upbringing in a household of four with biological family support, suggests a relatively low to moderate risk. The confidence level is set at 60 due to the limited information provided and the general nature of the factors mentioned.",
