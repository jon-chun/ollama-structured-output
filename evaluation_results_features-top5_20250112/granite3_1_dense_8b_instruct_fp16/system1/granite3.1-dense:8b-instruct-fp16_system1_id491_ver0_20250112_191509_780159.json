While being male and having held only one job could potentially be associated with higher risk, the individual's current living situation (cohabiting), stable household size (4 members), and familial relationship with his biological dad suggest a more stable environment. The unknown marital status at age 12 does not provide significant insight into current risk factors. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 60.",
