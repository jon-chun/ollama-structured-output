The individual's gender (female), marital status (never married, not cohabiting), employment history (3 jobs), household size (4), and family background (lived with biological dad) are all factors that do not typically correlate with high levels of criminal activity or recidivism. The fact that her marital status was unknown at age 12 does not provide significant insight into her risk level. However, the confidence in this prediction is moderate due to the limited information provided and the potential for other unmentioned factors influencing an individual's risk level.",
