Weight: high.\n2. **Held 1 job**: A limited work history may indicate employment difficulties or lack of motivation, both of which are relevant factors for recidivism. Weight: medium.\n3. **Household size of 5 and lived with their biological mother**: Growing up in a large household with a single parent might lead to increased exposure to stressors, potential lack of structure, and fewer resources for the individual. Weight: high.\n4. **Marital status unknown at age 12**: Limited information about family dynamics during childhood may indicate instability or neglect, which can be risk factors for recidivism. Weight: medium.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest recidivism within the next 3 years:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"never married, not cohabiting\", \"high\", \"Lack of social support and potential instability in life\"),\n    (\"held 1 job\", \"medium\", \"Limited work history may indicate employment difficulties or lack of motivation\"),\n    (\"household size of 5 and lived with their biological mother\", \"high\", \"Increased exposure to stressors, potential lack of structure, and fewer resources for the individual\"),\n    (\"marital status unknown at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Limited information about family dynamics during childhood may indicate instability or neglect\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 82\n}",
