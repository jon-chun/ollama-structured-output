    "raw_message_text": "Based on the provided information, I will assign relative weights to each risk factor as follows:\n\n1. **Marital Status**: Never married and not cohabiting is a significant risk factor for recidivism. This demographic characteristic has been consistently linked with higher rates of criminal behavior in research studies.\n\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Being unmarried and without a stable partner can lead to increased stress, financial instability, and social isolation, all of which are associated with higher crime rates.\n\n2. **Employment Status**: Unemployment is a well-documented risk factor for recidivism. Individuals who are not employed may lack the structure and stability that employment provides, increasing their likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Without a stable source of income or the social integration that often comes with employment, individuals may be more likely to engage in illegal activities to meet their financial needs or alleviate stress.\n\n3. **Household Size**: A large household size can indicate a variety of factors including poverty, overcrowding, and possibly increased exposure to criminal influences within the family or neighborhood.\n\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: While not as directly linked to recidivism as marital status or employment, a very large household size could suggest underlying issues such as financial strain or social isolation that may indirectly increase the risk of rearrest.\n\nGiven these assessments, the collective prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism would lean towards \"YES\", with a moderate level of confidence due to the presence of high-risk factors (unemployment and marital status) combined with a potentially stressful household situation.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"high\", \"Being unmarried and without a stable partner can lead to increased stress, financial instability, and social isolation.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment lacks the structure and stability that employment provides, increasing likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"medium\", \"Large household size indicates poverty, overcrowding, or exposure to criminal influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
