    "raw_message_text": "Based on the provided information, I will carefully consider each risk factor to assign a relative weight before making a prediction.\n\n1. **Marital Status**: The individual is never married, not cohabiting. This suggests a lack of social support and stability in personal relationships. However, it's essential to note that being single doesn't inherently increase recidivism rates. I'll assess this as a \"medium\" risk factor because while it might contribute to instability, other factors need consideration.\n\n2. **Employment History**: The person has held 2 jobs. Stable employment is generally seen as a positive factor in reducing criminal behavior due to increased stability and access to resources that can aid rehabilitation. I'll assign this a \"low\" risk since stable employment typically reduces the likelihood of recidivism.\n\n3. **Household Size**: A household size of 5 could indicate a busy home environment, possibly leading to less individual attention or supervision, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in delinquent behavior. However, large family sizes are not inherently linked to higher rates of crime. I'll consider this as \"medium\" risk.\n\n4. **Family Background at Age 12**: The fact that the person lived with both biological parents at age 12 suggests a relatively stable and supportive home environment during their formative years. This is generally seen as a positive factor for future life outcomes, including reduced criminal behavior. I'll rate this as \"low\" risk.\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall prediction leans towards a lower likelihood of rearrest recidivism due to a combination of stable employment and a relatively supportive family background during formative years.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support and stability in personal relationships might contribute to instability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Stable employment typically reduces the likelihood of recidivism due to increased stability and resources for rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"medium\", \"A busy home environment might lead to less individual attention or supervision, potentially increasing delinquent behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Background at Age 12\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents at age 12 indicates a stable and supportive home environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
