    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of rearrest recidivism, I'll consider various factors. Here's my analysis:\n\n1. **Demographic factor: Female**\n   - Typically associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n   - However, in this case, her marital and cohabitation status may indicate instability or a lack of social support.\n\nWeight: medium\nReasoning: While being female generally indicates lower risk, the person's unmarried and non-cohabiting status might offset some of these benefits.\n\n2. **Marital Status**\n   - Never married and not cohabiting might suggest instability in personal relationships.\n   - This could be a factor in increased recidivism due to lack of support or a stable environment.\n\nWeight: high\nReasoning: The absence of a stable relationship can contribute to a higher risk of rearrest.\n\n3. **Employment History**\n   - Held 4 jobs, which might indicate instability and difficulty maintaining employment.\n   - This could be a sign of underlying issues that increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nWeight: high\nReasoning: Frequent job changes often reflect deeper problems, such as substance abuse or personal issues, which can lead to rearrest.\n\n4. **Household Size**\n   - With 4 individuals in the household, there might be a lack of resources and support.\n   - Large households with multiple dependents can sometimes indicate financial stress or instability.\n\nWeight: medium\nReasoning: While not necessarily predictive of recidivism on its own, a large household size could contribute to an unstable environment that increases risk.\n\n5. **Age and Background Information**\n   - There is no information about age, criminal history, or other relevant background factors.\n   - Without this context, it's challenging to accurately assess the overall risk.\n\nWeight: N/A\nReasoning: Lack of specific demographic data makes a precise assessment difficult.\n\nCollectively considering these factors, I predict:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Demographic Factor\", \"medium\", \"Female with unmarried and non-cohabiting status might offset some benefits\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"high\", \"Absence of stable relationship increases risk\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Instability in employment can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"medium\", \"Large household size contributes to potential instability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}",
