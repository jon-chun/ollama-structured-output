While some factors such as being male and having multiple jobs can suggest higher risk, other factors like never being married or cohabiting, living with both biological parents at age 12, and having a larger household size (4) may indicate stability and lower risk. The context provided is not extensive enough to make a definitive high-risk assessment. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence of 60%.",
