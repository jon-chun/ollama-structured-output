    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation: The provided risk factors indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons. First, the individual's marital status (never married) and living arrangement (not cohabiting) are not inherently indicative of high-risk behavior. Second, having held two jobs suggests employability and stability, which are generally associated with lower risk levels. Lastly, growing up with both biological parents until age 12 could indicate a stable family environment, another factor linked to lower risk. However, the household size is relatively large (5), which might introduce some complexity or instability in living arrangements, but without further context, this factor alone does not justify a high-risk prediction. Overall, given these factors, a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence seems appropriate.",
