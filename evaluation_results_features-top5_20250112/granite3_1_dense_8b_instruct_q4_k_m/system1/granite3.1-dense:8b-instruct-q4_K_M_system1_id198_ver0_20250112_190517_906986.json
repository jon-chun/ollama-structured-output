Being a male, never married, and not cohabiting does not inherently suggest high risk. Having held only one job could potentially indicate instability but is not definitive. A household size of 4 suggests some social support, which may lower risk. Living with both biological parents at age 12 could indicate a stable upbringing. Therefore, the overall prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.",
