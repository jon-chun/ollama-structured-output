While having a large household size and job instability can sometimes be associated with higher risk, the lack of specific information about criminal history or substance abuse, as well as the supportive living situation with her biological mother, suggest a lower risk profile. The marital status at age 12 and never being married do not provide significant predictive value for criminal behavior in adulthood.",
