Being unmarried, not cohabiting, and currently unemployed can indicate financial strain or instability, which is associated with increased criminal behavior. A larger household size may also be linked to higher crime rates due to the increased likelihood of conflicts within the household. Living with a biological mother at age 12, without knowledge of her marital status, could indicate a lack of positive male role models or family structure, which is sometimes associated with higher crime risk. However, these factors alone do not guarantee high risk and are considered in conjunction with other variables for a comprehensive assessment.",
