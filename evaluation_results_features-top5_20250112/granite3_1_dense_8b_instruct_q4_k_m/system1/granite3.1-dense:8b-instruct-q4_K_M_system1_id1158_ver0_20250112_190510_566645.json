Being male is generally associated with higher crime rates in many studies, although not universally. Never married status can also be linked to increased risk, particularly if the individual has children outside of marriage. Cohabiting could suggest instability or transitional lifestyle, which might increase risk. The person having held only one job could indicate employment instability, a factor associated with recidivism. A household size of four suggests a larger social network that may be affected by the individual's actions, potentially increasing the impact of any offense. Living with their biological mother at age 12 might suggest some level of dependency or lack of paternal guidance. The unknown marital status at age 12 could imply instability in family dynamics during formative years. Collectively, these factors lean towards a higher risk assessment. However, it's important to note that risk assessments should ideally consider many more variables and contextual information for greater accuracy.",
