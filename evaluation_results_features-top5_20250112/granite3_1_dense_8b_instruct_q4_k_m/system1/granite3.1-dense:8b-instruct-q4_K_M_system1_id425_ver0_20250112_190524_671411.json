Being male, never married, and having held two jobs are not necessarily indicative of high risk. Living with both biological parents at age 12 is often associated with lower risk, as is a larger household size (5 people). The lack of cohabitation does not significantly increase risk. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence of 60%.",
