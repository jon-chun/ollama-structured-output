    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe risk factors provided suggest a higher likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior due to several reasons:\n\n1. Gender: Males are generally statistically more likely to be involved in crime, although this is not a definitive factor.\n2. Marital Status and Cohabitation: Being unmarried and not cohabiting can indicate social isolation or lack of commitment, which may contribute to riskier behavior.\n3. Employment Status: Unemployment increases the risk of criminal involvement as it can lead to financial stress, idleness, and reduced opportunities for prosocial activities.\n4. Household Size: A larger household size (in this case, 6 people) can sometimes indicate overcrowding or strained resources, which might contribute to increased conflict and risk-taking behavior.\n5. Parental History: Living with both biological parents at age 12 generally suggests a stable upbringing. However, in this context, the fact that these details are provided could imply that the individual's family life was not as straightforward as it seems, potentially indicating other risk factors such as dysfunctional relationships or lack of positive role models.\n\nWhile each factor on its own does not definitively predict criminal behavior, their combination suggests a moderate to high level of risk. Therefore, the \"prediction\" is set to \"YES\", and the \"confidence\" level is estimated at 75%.",
