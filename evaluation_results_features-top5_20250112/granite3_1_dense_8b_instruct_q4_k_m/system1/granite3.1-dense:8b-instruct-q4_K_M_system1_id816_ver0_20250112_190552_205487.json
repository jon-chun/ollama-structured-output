The individual's gender, marital status (never married), and household size are not typically significant indicators of recidivism or future criminal behavior. Having held only one job could potentially suggest economic instability, but without additional context about the nature of this job or employment history, it is difficult to assess as a high-risk factor. The fact that she lived with both biological parents at age 12 and cohabits now suggests a stable family environment, which generally correlates with lower risk. However, the confidence in this prediction is moderate due to the limited information provided.",
