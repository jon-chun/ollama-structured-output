    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation:\nAs a risk assessment expert, I would consider the provided factors in the context of established risk assessment models used in criminal justice. These models often include variables such as age, marital status, employment history, family structure, and parental presence during formative years.\n\n1. Gender (Male): While some studies show that males may be overrepresented in crime statistics, gender alone is not a reliable predictor of criminal behavior.\n2. Marital Status (Never married, not cohabiting): Being unmarried or not cohabiting does not necessarily indicate a higher risk for criminal behavior.\n3. Employment History (Held 2 jobs): Having held multiple jobs could suggest instability, but without further context on the nature of these jobs and the reasons for leaving them, it is difficult to draw conclusions about potential criminal behavior.\n4. Household Size (Size of 4): A larger household size does not inherently indicate a higher risk for criminal behavior.\n5. Family Structure (Lived with biological mother and other parent present at age 12): Growing up in a two-parent household, especially one where both parents were present until the individual was 12 years old, is generally associated with lower crime rates due to factors like increased supervision, stability, and positive role models.\n\nConsidering these factors together, without additional information pointing towards criminal behavior, I would predict a low to moderate risk for this individual. However, it's important to note that risk assessment is complex and context-dependent, and these predictions should be used as part of a comprehensive evaluation process.",
