While being male, having held multiple jobs, and living in a larger household size could potentially indicate higher risk, these factors are not definitive indicators of recidivism or criminal behavior. The fact that the person lived with their biological mother and had a household size of 5 might suggest some level of family support, which could mitigate against higher risk. However, without more context or additional risk factors (such as history of criminal behavior, substance abuse, etc.), it is difficult to definitively classify this individual as high-risk. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 60%.",
