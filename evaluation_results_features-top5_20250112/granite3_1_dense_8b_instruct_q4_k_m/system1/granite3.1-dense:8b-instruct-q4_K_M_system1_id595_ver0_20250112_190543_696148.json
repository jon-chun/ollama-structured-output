The person's gender (male) and marital status (never married, not cohabiting) do not inherently indicate high risk. Having held two jobs could suggest stability or employment history, which is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior. A household size of four might imply a strong family support system, which can also be a protective factor. Living with the biological mother at age 12 suggests a stable home environment during formative years. However, without more context or specific risk assessment tools, it's challenging to make a definitive \"high-risk\" prediction. The confidence level is set at 60 due to the relatively low risk indicated by these factors.",
