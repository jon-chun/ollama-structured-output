    "raw_message_text": "First, we need to understand the risk factors mentioned:\n\n1. Female: This could be a protective factor as female offenders generally have lower recidivism rates.\n2. Never married: This may suggest a lack of strong family ties which can potentially increase the risk of rearrest.\n3. Not cohabiting: Lack of stable housing might also indicate instability that could lead to increased risk.\n4. Held 3 jobs with a household size of 5: Frequent job changes and large household sizes are often associated with higher recidivism rates.\n5. Lived with biological mother at age 12: This suggests early life stability which is generally protective against future criminal behavior.\n\nBased on these considerations, let's assign relative weights:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female offenders have lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Married individuals typically exhibit less criminality than singles\"),\n    (\"housing_stability\", \"high\", \"Lack of stable housing is associated with higher rearrest rates\"),\n    (\"employment_frequency\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes increase the risk of rearrest\"),\n    (\"family_environment_childhood\", \"low\", \"Stable early life environment is generally protective against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nThis analysis suggests that there are medium-high risks in this case. The female's low recidivism rate due to her gender slightly offsets the higher risk factors, leading us to predict a likelihood of rearrest with a moderate level of confidence (75%).",
