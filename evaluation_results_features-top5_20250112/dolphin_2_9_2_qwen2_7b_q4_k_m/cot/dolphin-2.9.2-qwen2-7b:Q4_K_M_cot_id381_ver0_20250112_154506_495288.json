    "raw_message_text": "Based on the information provided, let's assess each risk factor:\n\n1. Gender: Male - This is a medium risk factor as studies have indicated that men are more likely to be involved in criminal activities than women.\n2. Marital Status: Never married - This is a high risk factor as single individuals tend to have less social support and may engage in risky behavior.\n3. Cohabitation status: Not cohabiting - A medium risk factor because living alone can lead to isolation, which might increase the likelihood of criminal activities.\n4. Job History: 1 job - A low risk factor as it implies a stable work history, which is often associated with lower recidivism rates.\n5. Household size: 5 - This is a low risk factor as larger households generally provide more social support and supervision.\n6. Living situation at age 12: With both biological parents - This is a low risk factor because growing up in an intact family has been shown to reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nBased on this analysis, my prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism would be:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Men are more likely to engage in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Single individuals tend to have less social support and may engage in risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"cohabitation_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation, which might increase the likelihood of criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Stable work history is often associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Larger households generally provide more social support and supervision.\"),\n    (\"living_situation_at_age_12\", \"low\", \"Growing up in an intact family has been shown to reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
