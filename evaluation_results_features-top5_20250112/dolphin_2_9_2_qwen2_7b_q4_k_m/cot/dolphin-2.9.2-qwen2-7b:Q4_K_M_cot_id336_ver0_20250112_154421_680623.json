Here's how I would analyze this case step by step:\n\nStep 1: Gather relevant information.\nThe individual in question is a male who has never been married or cohabiting; he holds two jobs and lives with his household size of five which includes his biological mother (marital status unknown at age 12).\n\nStep 2: Identify potential risk factors.\nPossible factors could include:\n- Never Married/ Cohabitating - This might indicate a lack of stable social relationships, possibly increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities for survival or excitement.\n- Holding two jobs and living with household size five - This may suggest financial strain which can lead to desperation that could potentially drive individuals into criminal activities for financial gain. Also, larger households often provide more cover for criminal activities due to the presence of multiple people.\n- Marital Status Unknown at age 12 - The individual's early life circumstances might have had a significant impact on their present behavior and choices.\n\nStep 3: Assign relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never Married/ Cohabitating\", \"medium\", \"Could indicate lack of stable social relationships.\"),\n    (\"Holding two jobs and living with household size five\", \"high\", \"Possible signs of financial strain or desperation which can lead to criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status Unknown at age 12\", \"low\", \"Early life circumstances might have a significant impact on present behavior.\")\n  ]\n}\n\nStep 4: Use these factors to collectively predict rearrest recidivism. \nBased on the weight assigned, I would predict:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
