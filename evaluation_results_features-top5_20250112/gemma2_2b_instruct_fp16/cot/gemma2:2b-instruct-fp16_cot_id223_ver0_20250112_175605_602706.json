This is assigned a high weight.\n2. **Never Married:**  Being unmarried generally indicates fewer social support networks and possibly more difficulty developing stable living arrangements. High weight.\n3. **Not Cohabiting:** While not necessarily indicative of criminal behavior, this indicates an individual may lack shared responsibilities and potential for community support within the home. Medium weight. \n4. **Household Size 3:** This suggests a limited social network and a smaller circle to provide support during challenging times. Low weight.\n5. **Two Jobs Held:**  This may indicate stability, but it also depends on individual circumstances. No significant risk factor associated with this.\n\n**Confidence Level:** The high weight given to factors related to family dynamics and relationship status (marital status unknown at age 12) creates a strong likelihood of recidivism. While other factors might be present, the combination of these indicates a heightened risk for rearrest within three years.  \n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Contextual Factors:** This analysis is simplified. A full assessment would require a detailed understanding of each individual's specific circumstances and prior criminal history (if any).\n* **Statistical Models:** More complex statistical models can refine this prediction by incorporating more variables, but a basic risk assessment using these factors provides a preliminary indication. \n",
