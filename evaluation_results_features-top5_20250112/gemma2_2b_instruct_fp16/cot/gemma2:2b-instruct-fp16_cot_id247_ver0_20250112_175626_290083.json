Therefore, this factor is weighted higher.\n* **Household Size**: While larger households often come with greater financial burden, they can also offer social networks that may act as deterrents. This factor is considered medium due to the potential benefits and drawbacks. \n* **Parental Background**:  This factor's weight is low because it does not provide strong predictive power for future behavior. A stable childhood isn't a foolproof predictor of adult criminality. \n* **Employment History**:  A history of consistent employment can lead to financial stability and a sense of purpose, reducing the likelihood of criminal activity. However, job instability or unemployment could be associated with increased risk. This factor is rated medium because it carries some potential negative factors.\n\n**Note:** The prediction \"NO\" indicates that based on this individual's information, there is not enough evidence to predict high recidivism in three years. \n\n\nLet me emphasize again, this is a simplified example and real-world risk assessment involves much more complex analysis and consideration of many other factors. This is for illustrative purposes only.  For any actual application, professional judgment and expertise are essential. \n",
