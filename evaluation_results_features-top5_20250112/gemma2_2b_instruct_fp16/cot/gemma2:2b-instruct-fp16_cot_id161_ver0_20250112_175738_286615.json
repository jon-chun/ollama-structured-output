The individual's employment stability is also high due to multiple jobs, which is often associated with increased recidivism. However, living in a larger household may indicate a lack of independent responsibility. Group quarters residence at age 12 could potentially be considered a risk factor but requires context to make a more accurate assessment.  \n",
