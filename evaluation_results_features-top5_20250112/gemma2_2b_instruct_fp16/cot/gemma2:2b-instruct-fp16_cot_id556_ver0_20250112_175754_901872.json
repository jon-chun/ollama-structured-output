It's assigned a medium weight due to its potential impact on social support.\n* **Never Married:** High weight because it indicates a lack of long-term committed relationships, suggesting possible challenges in maintaining stable living arrangements and personal support systems. \n* **Single Person:** Medium weight as being single does not inherently suggest high recidivism risk; however, the lack of strong interpersonal connections can increase vulnerability to peer pressure or other social issues that might influence criminal behavior.\n* **Household Size 4:** Low weight because a larger household size doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism risk. It could indicate potential support structures but isn't a significant predictor in this case.\n\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes. \n* Real-world recidivism prediction is complex, involving numerous social, psychological, and environmental factors beyond what is captured by these basic variables.\n* The \"confidence\" value reflects the strength of the evidence based on the provided information. It's subjective and influenced by expert judgment.\n\n\n",
