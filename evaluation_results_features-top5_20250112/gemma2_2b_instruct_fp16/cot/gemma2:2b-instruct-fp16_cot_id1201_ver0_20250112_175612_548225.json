It could be a lack of information or a family dynamic that hasn't fully manifested.  \n* **Cohabiting (Low):** Cohabitation can indicate a stable relationship and shared support system, which reduces recidivism in some cases. \n* **Never Married (High):** Single status is generally associated with increased risk factors for crime, particularly violent offenses. \n* **Household Size of 3 (Low):**  A larger household may provide more social capital and a greater safety net, potentially reducing the risk. \n* **Held 3 Jobs (Medium):**  This indicates some level of employment stability, which is generally good for long-term reintegration.  However, it could also be indicative of instability. \n* **Biological Mother Lived With (Low):** Family structure plays a role in many factors affecting recidivism, but this individual's upbringing may not significantly predict their future behavior.\n\n**Confidence:**\n\nThe confidence score is 80% because the absence of strong indicators in several risk factors makes it difficult to definitively assign an extremely high or low prediction.  However, given the higher weight assigned to never married status, we lean towards a less likely prediction for recidivism in the next three years.\n\n\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis should not be considered definitive or a substitute for professional legal and forensic evaluation. \n",
