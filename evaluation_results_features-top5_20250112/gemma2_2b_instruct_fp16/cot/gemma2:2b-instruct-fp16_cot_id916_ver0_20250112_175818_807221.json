However, it could contribute to social isolation and financial instability compared to married individuals, making this a moderate risk factor.\n* **Cohabiting (Low):** Cohabitation may indicate a more stable living arrangement and support system than a single individual. \n* **Number of jobs held (Low):** A couple of jobs can be a sign of commitment and stability but not necessarily a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\n* **Household size (Medium):** Larger households, potentially involving multiple individuals in the same residence, may suggest a more complex family network or support system, which could either increase or decrease risk depending on individual circumstances.\n* **Age at time of family breakdown (High):** Individuals who experienced significant family disruption as children (especially during early adolescence) might be at higher risk of future criminal activity and recidivism due to factors like instability, trauma, and limited support systems. \n\n\nWhile the provided information is helpful for understanding potential risk factors, it's crucial to remember that a comprehensive assessment includes many other factors beyond those listed above. Additionally, predicting recidivism is complex and requires a holistic approach, taking into account the individual's specific circumstances, criminal history, psychological profile, and access to resources. \n",
