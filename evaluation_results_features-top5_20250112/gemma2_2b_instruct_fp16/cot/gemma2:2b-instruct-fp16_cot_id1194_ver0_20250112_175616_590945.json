The unknown marital status suggests a potentially less stable family structure, which might increase risk. However, the lack of data limits our ability to make a precise assessment.\n\n* **Never Married**: This factor is classified as \"high\" due to strong evidence linking marital status to recidivism reduction. Marriage provides support systems and accountability that can reduce crime rates. \n\n* **Not Cohabiting**:  This factor is rated \"low\". While not ideal, cohabitation doesn't inherently signify increased risk for most individuals in the population.\n* **Household Size 4**: This factor is rated \"low\". A larger household size may indicate more support and potential for community ties that could decrease recidivism.\n\n* **Jobs Held 2**: This factor is ranked \"medium\". While having two jobs shows some level of employment stability, it doesn't necessarily correlate with a reduced risk of reoffending on its own.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  This assessment provides a general framework. A thorough criminal risk assessment requires careful consideration of the specific individual's history and current circumstances along with additional data points that are not included here. \n",
