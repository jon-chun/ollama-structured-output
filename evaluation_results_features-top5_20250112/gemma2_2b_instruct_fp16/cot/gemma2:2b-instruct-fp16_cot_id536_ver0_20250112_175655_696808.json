This factor is assigned low as it might not necessarily be linked to criminal activity.\n* **Household Size:**  Larger households could indicate a higher support network. However, this doesn't necessarily imply increased criminal involvement, leading to a medium weight. \n* **Previous Family Structure:** Living with both parents at age 12 suggests a stable family background and may mitigate risk. Low weight assigned. \n* **Employment History:**  Three jobs could indicate some level of stability and financial independence which could impact recidivism. Medium weight given as it can be both positive and negative depending on the circumstances.\n\n**Important Considerations:** This is a highly simplified analysis based on limited information. A comprehensive risk assessment would involve many more factors, including: \n* **Offense Characteristics:** Type of crime, severity, specific offender history.\n* **Social Network:** Support system, peer groups, involvement in criminal activity.\n* **Personal Circumstances:**  Health, education, finances, mental health.\n* **Legal History:** Past convictions, probation or parole status.\n\n**Further Research:** \nTo improve the accuracy of this assessment, additional information and a more sophisticated risk assessment model would be needed.  \n\n\n",
