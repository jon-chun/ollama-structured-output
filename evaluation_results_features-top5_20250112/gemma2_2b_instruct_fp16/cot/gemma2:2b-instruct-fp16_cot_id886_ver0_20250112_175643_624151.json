This factor should be treated as high risk, however, it needs to be seen alongside other factors like employment status.\n* **Cohabitation status is low**: This suggests the individual may have a stronger support system and may not be isolated from potential criminal influences. \n* **Household size is high**: A large household size might suggest a limited personal space and difficulty maintaining self-discipline.  This could increase the risk of engaging in risky behavior, especially if they are not fully integrated into their home environment.\n* **Parental presence at age 12** was present but doesn't strongly affect recidivism.\n\n\n**Important Note:** This is a simplified example for demonstration purposes only. Real-world criminal justice risk assessment involves much more complex data and considerations, including detailed background information on the individual, specific crime history, substance abuse, mental health status, etc.  The use of this model alone cannot make accurate predictions about recidivism. \n\n\n",
