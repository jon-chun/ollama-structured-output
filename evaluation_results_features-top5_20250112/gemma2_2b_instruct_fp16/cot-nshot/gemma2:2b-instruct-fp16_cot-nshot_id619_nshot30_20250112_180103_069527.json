The absence of marital ties suggests a greater likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors and social isolation, both of which can contribute to recidivism.\n* **Not cohabiting:** Similar to the \"never married\" factor, this indicates potential limitations on social support and a higher probability of being isolated, which can increase the risk of criminal activity and hinder successful reintegration into society. \n* **Unemployed:**  Unemployment is a significant predictor of recidivism as financial strain and social isolation are often associated with it. This can lead to desperation, making individuals more prone to engaging in criminal activities to meet basic needs. \n* **Household size 4:** While a large household size might suggest greater support systems, the fact that this factor is classified as \"medium\" suggests its impact on recidivism risk is not as strong compared to other factors like marital status and unemployment.\n\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is based solely on the provided n-shot examples. Real-world criminal justice contexts require a more nuanced understanding of individual situations, history, and social environment. \n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
