It suggests potential lack of support systems or stability, leading to higher risk.\n* **Not Cohabiting:** This factor suggests a lack of social support and structure, further increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity for financial or emotional reasons. \n* **Unemployed:**  This factor is highly associated with recidivism as individuals without stable employment may experience greater desperation and vulnerability to negative choices.   \n\n\n**Important Note**:  It's essential to remember that this analysis is based on a limited dataset (26 examples). More data, particularly from diverse populations, would be needed for accurate prediction. Additionally, it is crucial to consider other factors like age, mental health status, prior criminal history, and community resources. \n",
