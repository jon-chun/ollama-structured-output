The \"never married\" factor stands out as a significant factor due to the high correlation with recidivism in the dataset, which influences our prediction. \n* **Prediction:**  The combination of these factors leads us to predict NO for this individual.\n* **Confidence:** While we can make educated guesses based on this limited data set, there is always uncertainty with predictions. We've assigned a confidence score of 80% to reflect that.\n\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis relies heavily on the provided examples and should be seen as an initial assessment, not definitive.\n* A real-world risk assessment would require far more data and nuanced consideration.  It is also crucial to consider factors like age, prior criminal history, community ties, and available support systems. \n",
