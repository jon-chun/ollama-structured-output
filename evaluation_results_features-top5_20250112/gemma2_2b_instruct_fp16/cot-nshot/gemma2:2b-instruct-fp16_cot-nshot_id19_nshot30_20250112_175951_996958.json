Lack of cohabitation can indicate instability and independent living choices, which are linked to increased risk. \n* **5 Jobs Held:** Medium weight due to its potential connection to employment stability and income issues. This doesn't necessarily indicate high risk but needs further investigation.  \n* **Household Size:** Medium weight. The size of the household isn't a strong indicator compared to other factors, particularly when considering individual circumstances.\n* **Lived with Both Biological Parents at Age 12:** Low weight because age is not a significant predictor in this context and doesn't consistently correlate to recidivism.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited data and general trends. It should not be interpreted as definitive or exhaustive.  \n* A more comprehensive risk assessment would need to consider additional factors such as age, criminal history, educational attainment, and support network. \n\n\n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 6 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not
