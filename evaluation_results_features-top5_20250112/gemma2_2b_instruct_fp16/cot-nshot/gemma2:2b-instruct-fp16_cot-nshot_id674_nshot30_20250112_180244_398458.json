Predicting recidivism is complex, with many factors beyond the provided examples influencing individual risk.  This JSON response provides a preliminary assessment, and a more comprehensive analysis would require additional data and expert judgement. \n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 6 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not
