The number of jobs doesn't appear to be a significant predictor in this dataset.\n* **Household Size 4:** This is given low weight because household size isn't as strongly correlated with recidivism as other factors like marital status or employment history.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Limited Dataset:** A small sample size (n-shot) makes it hard to generalize findings beyond the cases provided. \n* **Context and Nuance:** Recidivism is a complex issue, influenced by many personal and social factors.  A single assessment based on these factors alone may not be accurate or comprehensive.\n* **Confidence Level:** The confidence level reflects my analysis of the provided data, but it's important to recognize that this prediction relies on limited information. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other case studies! \n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 6 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not

their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
