Household size is also seen as medium due to its potential impact on support systems.\n* **Low Weighting Factor:** The mother's marital status at age 12 is assigned a low weight due to insufficient data to assess its relevance to recidivism.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* This analysis is based solely on the provided examples and may not fully capture the complexity of predicting recidivism.\n*  This model needs further refinement and expansion with more diverse real-world examples for accurate prediction. \n* Additional factors like age, criminal history, socioeconomic status, and specific offenses should be factored in for a more robust risk assessment.\n\n\n",
