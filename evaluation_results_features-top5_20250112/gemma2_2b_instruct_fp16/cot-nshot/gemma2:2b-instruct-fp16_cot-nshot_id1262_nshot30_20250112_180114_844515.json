This factor holds significant weight in predicting future crime.\n* **Limited employment history**: A low or medium-level weight here reflects that while it might be an indicator, the case lacks sufficient detail to assign a strong prediction. \n* **The influence of family structure**: The case's focus on a \"biological dad\" suggests potential risk factors. This is because parental relationships are often intertwined with individual development and behavior.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThis analysis should not be considered definitive. It provides a starting point for further investigation and decision-making based on a more comprehensive picture of the situation. \n",

their biological dad, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
