However, the nature of this relationship and its stability are key factors in determining risk.  We assigned it \"medium\" because we are not provided enough information about their marriage to give a more precise assessment.\n* **Spouse Present:**  A spouse living with the individual suggests a potential support system and shared accountability, potentially reducing recidivism. This factor is ranked as \"high\". \n* **Household Size:** A smaller household size could indicate less family pressure or dependence on others, suggesting lower recidivism risk. We assigned this factor to \"low.\"\n* **Jobs Held:** The number of jobs held can reflect an individual's employment history and stability. A single job might suggest a lack of long-term employment stability, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. This factor is ranked as \"medium.\"\n* **Age 12 Parental Status:**  While this factor is not directly predictive of recidivism, it hints at potential family instability or challenges. We ranked it as \"high\" because we cannot be certain about the nature and stability of their upbringing. \n\n**Confidence Level:** A confidence level of 80 indicates a relatively high degree of certainty in the prediction.  \n\n\n\nRemember: This is a simplified analysis based on limited data points and should not be considered definitive. A comprehensive assessment requires a more nuanced understanding of the individual's circumstances, background, and current situation. \n",
