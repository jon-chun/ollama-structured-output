A larger and more diverse dataset would be needed for a truly accurate prediction.\n* The weight assigned to each factor is subjective and based on general risk trends.  \n* Recidivism is complex and influenced by a multitude of factors beyond these listed, making it difficult to predict with absolute certainty. \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis should not be taken as professional legal or psychological advice.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
