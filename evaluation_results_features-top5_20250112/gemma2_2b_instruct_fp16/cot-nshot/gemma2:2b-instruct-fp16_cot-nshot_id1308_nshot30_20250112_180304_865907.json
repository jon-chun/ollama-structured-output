It's assigned high weight because it's consistently linked with increased risk across the data.\n* **Not Cohabiting:**  Indicates a lack of social stability and support systems, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.  It's also a significant factor, so it's given high weight. \n* **Currently Unemployed:** Unemployment is associated with financial instability, leading to desperation and potential for crime as a means of survival. It's assigned medium weight because while a strong indicator of increased risk, the link isn't always direct.\n* **Household Size 5:** Larger households often involve greater dependency and shared resources, which can lead to challenges in managing finances and social support.  High weight is given based on data patterns.\n* **Lived with Biological Mother:**  Stable family environments are associated with lower recidivism rates. This factor's low weight reflects the potential for positive influence despite other factors present.\n\n\n**Note:** It's important to acknowledge that this analysis relies on a limited dataset and general trends observed in past cases. Each individual case presents unique circumstances, which may affect predictions. \n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
