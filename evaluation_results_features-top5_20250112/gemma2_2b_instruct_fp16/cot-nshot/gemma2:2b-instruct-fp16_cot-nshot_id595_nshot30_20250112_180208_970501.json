This risk factor is considered 'medium' as it could signify a lack of traditional support systems, which could be a contributing factor to recidivism.\n* **Not Cohabiting**:  Lack of a stable living arrangement suggests a potential lack of structure and community support, a key factor in recidivism. It's also categorized as 'medium' risk. \n* **Held 2 Jobs**: This is considered 'low' as it doesn't directly indicate significant criminal activity or instability. The focus is on the other factors. \n* **Household Size 4**:  This is categorized as 'low' because a larger household size isn't generally associated with high recidivism risk.\n* **Lived with Biological Mother**: This factor, while potentially suggesting a strong family unit, doesn't carry a high weight in predicting future behavior. It's considered 'medium' due to the lack of direct correlation with recidivism.\n\n**Important Considerations:** \n\nThe prediction is based on a limited sample and should not be taken as definitive. The model relies on statistical relationships, but human actions are far more complex.  Factors like employment status, criminal history, substance abuse, mental health issues, and community support systems play critical roles in recidivism risk.\n",
