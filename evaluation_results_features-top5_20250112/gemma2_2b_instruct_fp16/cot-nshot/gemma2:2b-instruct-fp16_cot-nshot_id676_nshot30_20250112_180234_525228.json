A more robust prediction would require a significantly larger dataset with diverse risk factors and individual circumstances. Additionally, this is a simplified approach. In real-world applications, sophisticated algorithms consider various socioeconomic, psychological, and behavioral factors in addition to these few examples. \n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
