This reflects the probability we have based on the data and our understanding of these factors. \n\n\n**Important Notes:** This analysis is simplified. A more comprehensive prediction would likely involve additional variables (age, prior criminal record, etc.)\n\n\n\nLet me know if you'd like to explore how other risk factors might be weighed or investigate the model further! \n",
