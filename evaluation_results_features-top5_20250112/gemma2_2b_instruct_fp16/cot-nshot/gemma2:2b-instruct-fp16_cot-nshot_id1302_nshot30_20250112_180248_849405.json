However, the dataset does not provide strong evidence that this is directly related to higher recidivism. \n* **Held 2 Jobs:** A low-weight factor as it's less impactful than other factors in predicting recidivism.\n* **Household Size 4:** This is a medium-weighted factor because while having larger households can be a risk factor, the dataset doesn't show a strong correlation with recidivism. \n* **Biological Mother:**  This factor carries high weight due to potential familial connections and possible support networks but does not have much predictive power for recidivism in this data set.\n* **Marital Status Unknown:** This is a significant indicator of potential instability, which may increase the risk of recidivism.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* The model's prediction relies on a limited dataset.\n* Additional factors like age, criminal history, and educational attainment are not included in this analysis. \n*  It's essential to consider context and individual circumstances when making predictions about someone's future actions. \n\n\n\n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 6 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not
