Married individuals are statistically less likely to re-offend compared to single individuals. \n* **Jobs Held:**  While holding a job indicates stability, it's not as strong a predictor as other factors in this case. \n* **Household Size:** The individual living with others does not strongly suggest increased risk of recidivism.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\nThis analysis is based on limited data points and should be interpreted cautiously. A more comprehensive predictive model would require further information, considering other relevant social determinants, criminal history, community support, etc., for a precise prediction. \n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 6 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not

using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a male who is married, spouse present and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 4.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format,
