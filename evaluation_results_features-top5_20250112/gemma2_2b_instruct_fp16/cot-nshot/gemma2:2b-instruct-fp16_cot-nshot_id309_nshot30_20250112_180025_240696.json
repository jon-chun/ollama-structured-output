High weighting due to its direct impact on individuals' lives.  \n* **Biological Mother:** This factor carries a lower weight than the first two as other familial relationships might have stronger connections to recidivism. \n\n**Important Notes**:\n\n* This analysis reflects the provided data. Further research and real-world validation are necessary for accurate prediction.\n* The \"confidence\" score indicates the level of certainty in the predicted outcome, which is based on the current dataset's limited scope.  It should be considered a probabilistic estimate rather than absolute certainty. \n",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting

using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a male who is never married, not cohabiting and is currently unemployed with a household size of 2 and lived with their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\",
