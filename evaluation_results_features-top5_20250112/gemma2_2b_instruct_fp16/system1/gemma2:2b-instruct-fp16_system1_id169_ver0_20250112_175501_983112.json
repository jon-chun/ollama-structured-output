    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n``` \n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile these risk factors could be indicators of potential issues, they are not strong enough to suggest high risk in a general assessment. Here's why:\n\n* **Sex and Marital Status:** Not being married or having no partner is common, and it doesn't inherently indicate criminal tendencies.\n* **Household size:**  A household size of 4 does not automatically correlate with violent behavior. It could reflect family structure, cultural norms, etc.\n* **Previous Living Situation:**  Living with both parents at age 12 doesn't necessarily have predictive power for future behavior.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\nThis analysis is based on limited information and assumes a general statistical approach. A more comprehensive assessment would require:\n\n* **Detailed Criminal History**:  A thorough review of past offenses, convictions, and court records is crucial.\n* **Social Context:**  Understanding the person's social environment (community ties, support systems, etc.) provides crucial context. \n* **Specific Risk Factors**: Identifying specific risk factors related to the individual's circumstances is vital.\n* **Professional Judgement:** A trained risk assessment expert, using judicial knowledge and experience, must interpret these factors alongside other data points.\n\n**Disclaimer:**  This response is for informational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional legal or psychological advice. \n",
