    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n``` \n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nWhile some of the factors provided (unemployment, single status) can indicate higher risk in a general context, it's crucial to understand:\n\n* **Correlation vs. Causation:** A statistical analysis cannot conclude that these factors directly *cause* criminal behavior.  Many factors contribute to crime, and these alone are not definitive predictors.\n* **Lack of Context:** We need more information to make an accurate assessment.  Factors like:\n    * **Age:** Is the person young or older? Age is a significant factor in risk assessment. \n    * **Prior Criminal History:** Does the individual have any prior convictions or involvement with law enforcement?\n    * **Mental Health:** Are there signs of mental health issues, substance abuse, or other factors that might contribute to criminal behavior? \n    * **Social Support:** Does this person have a network of friends, family, or community resources that could help them avoid negative situations?\n\n**Important Considerations for Risk Assessment:**\n\n* **Holistic Approach:** Risk assessment should consider the individual's entire life history, not just isolated factors. \n* **Re-evaluation over Time:**  Risk levels change over time as a person's circumstances evolve.\n* **Ethical Concerns:** It is crucial to avoid profiling and ensure that risk assessments are used fairly and ethically.\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This analysis provides general insights based on the provided information. A proper risk assessment would require much more data and involve consultation with professionals. \n",
