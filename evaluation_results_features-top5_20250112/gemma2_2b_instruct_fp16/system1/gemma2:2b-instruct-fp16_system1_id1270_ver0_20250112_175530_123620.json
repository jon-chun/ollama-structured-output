Their age at this point in their life might be a significant factor.\n* **Other Factors:**  Many other factors influence risk assessment. This profile alone shouldn't determine a person's criminal responsibility or future behavior. \n* **Data Limitations:** Without additional data points about the individual, their history of involvement with law enforcement, and specific circumstances, it is difficult to quantify the level of risk precisely.\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide legal advice or replace professional risk assessment by qualified experts. \n",
