The reasoning behind each assigned risk factor weight and the final prediction considers both the individual's personal circumstances (such as being married, unemployed, having a large household, and growing up in a stable environment) and their demographic characteristics (being male). The prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 75%, suggesting that, given the described factors, the individual has a relatively low risk of rearrest within three years.",
