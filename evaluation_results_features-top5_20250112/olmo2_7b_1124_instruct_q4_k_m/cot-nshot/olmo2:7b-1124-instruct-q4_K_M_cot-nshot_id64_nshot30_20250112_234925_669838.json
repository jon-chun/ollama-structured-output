The fact that she has never been married carries a high weight due to previous examples indicating a higher probability of rearrest for never married individuals. Not cohabiting also contributes moderately to the risk assessment due to social support usually provided by living with a partner. Employment, indicated by having held one job, slightly lowers the risk compared to cases with no employment history or multiple jobs, as it can provide structure and regular income. However, given the high weight of marital status and cohabitation, this case is predicted to have a 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome of \"YES\" with a confidence level of 75%.",
