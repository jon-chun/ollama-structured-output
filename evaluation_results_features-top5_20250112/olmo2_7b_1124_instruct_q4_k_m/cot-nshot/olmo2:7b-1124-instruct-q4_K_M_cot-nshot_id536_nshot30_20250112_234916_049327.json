However, without information on the current job stability, it's challenging to assign a definitive weight.\n\nGiven these weights and the information provided in examples, I predict this individual has a **75% confidence** level of being at risk for 3-year rearrest recidivism. This prediction is based on the significant weight given to being never married, which appears to be a strong indicator of higher risk in these cases.",
