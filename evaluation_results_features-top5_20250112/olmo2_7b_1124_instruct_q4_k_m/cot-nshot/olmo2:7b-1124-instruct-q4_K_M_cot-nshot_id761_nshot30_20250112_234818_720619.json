While employment generally reduces recidivism, the specific details about the job (e.g., quality of the job, working conditions) are not provided and could influence the prediction.\n4. **Household size of 4:** This factor is assigned a \"low\" weight because larger households might offer more social support, which typically lowers the risk.\n5. **Lived with both biological parents at age 12:** As stable family upbringing generally reduces recidivism, this factor is given a \"medium\" weight.\n\nThe overall prediction is \"YES\", reflecting the combined effect of these risk factors, with a confidence level of 75%. This suggests a moderate to high confidence in the prediction.",
