The reasoning behind each risk factor score is as follows:\n\n1. **Married**: Scored \"low\" because being married often correlates with lower recidivism rates due to the stability and support it typically provides.\n2. **Spouse Present**: Scored \"medium\" because a spouse adds an additional layer of social support and can act as a deterrent against criminal behavior.\n3. **Held 2 Jobs**: Scored \"low\" because holding two jobs indicates some level of employment stability, which has been linked to lower recidivism rates.\n4. **Household Size**: Scored \"medium\" because a larger household can provide a more supportive environment and potentially more accountability, factors that may reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest a low risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual.",
