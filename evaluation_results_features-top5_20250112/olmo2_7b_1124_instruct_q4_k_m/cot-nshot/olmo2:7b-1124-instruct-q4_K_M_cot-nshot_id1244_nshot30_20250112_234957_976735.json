The main contributors to this prediction include never being married (high weight) and living in a potentially unstable environment due to an unknown marital status of the biological mother at age 12, combined with a larger household size suggesting complex living situations. Holding two jobs could mitigate this somewhat by indicating adaptability. However, without cohabitation, which typically provides social support, the risk remains elevated. The confidence in this prediction is rated at 75% due to the moderately high weight assigned to these factors.",
