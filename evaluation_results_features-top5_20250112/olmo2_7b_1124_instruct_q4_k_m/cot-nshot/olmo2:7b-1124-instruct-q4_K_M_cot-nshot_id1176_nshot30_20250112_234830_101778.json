The reasoning for each factor is detailed as follows:\n\n- **Never married**: Previous examples suggest a higher risk for recidivism among never-married individuals.\n- **Not cohabiting**: Living arrangements outside of marriage or cohabitation typically imply less stable living conditions, which can influence behavior.\n- **Held 1 job**: Holding at least one job indicates some level of stability and responsibility, which generally lowers the risk of recidivism.\n- **Household size of 6**: While a larger household could introduce more complexity into an individual's social environment, it is not strongly predictive on its own.\n- **Lived with biological mother**: Living with a parent can suggest a stable environment. However, without additional details on parental involvement or supervision, this factor is deemed medium risk.\n\nGiven these considerations, the overall prediction leans towards recidivism (\"YES\") with a confidence level of 75%.",

their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
