Given that three out of five identified risk factors are classified as either 'high' or 'medium', the overall risk assessment suggests a higher likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n- The confidence score (65%) reflects the degree of certainty in this prediction, accounting for both the strength of each risk factor and the statistical patterns observed across similar cases.",

using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a male who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 4 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n
