The individual's never having married suggests a lack of this potential protective factor.\n  \n- **Not cohabiting** (\"low\"): Living alone might increase the likelihood of isolation and less social control, potentially leading to increased risk unless balanced by other mitigating factors.\n\n- **Currently unemployed** (\"medium\"): Unemployment can be a risk factor for recidivism due to reduced financial stability and lack of legal employment opportunities. However, it's crucial to consider it in conjunction with other factors.\n\n- **Household size of 5** (\"low\"): A larger household size generally means more support and supervision, which can lower recidivism risk. The key is that the household environment should be stable and supportive.\n\n- **Lived with both biological parents at age 12** (\"medium\"): Parental presence is often associated with a lower risk of reoffending, but this factor's weight is medium because the quality of the parent-child relationship and overall family dynamics can greatly impact its protective effect.\n\nGiven these assessments, the overall prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 75%. This means there is a moderate to high chance that this individual will be re-arrested within three years, based on the provided risk factors and the analysis provided.",
