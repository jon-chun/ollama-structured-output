However, in this analysis, it appears less impactful compared to the marital status.\n\n3. **One Job**: This gets a \"medium\" rating. While job stability is important, the example provided lacks details on employment duration or type, making it challenging to assess its direct impact here.\n\n4. **Household Size 4**: With a \"low\" weight, larger households might typically provide social support which could mitigate risk. However, this specific detail doesn't strongly lean towards either increased or decreased risk in this analysis.\n\n5. **Lived with Biological Mother**: This gets a \"medium\" rating. Living with a single parent, especially when the marital status is unknown, could indicate a potentially less structured environment, which might influence risk of rearrest. \n\nOverall confidence in the prediction is 80%. The prediction is YES, suggesting this individual has a higher likelihood of rearrest within 3 years due to their never-married status and living arrangements, despite some mitigating factors like household size and employment history.",
