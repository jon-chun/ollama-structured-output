These factors, combined with living with the biological mother and an unspecified marital status at age 12, contribute to a higher risk classification according to the analysis of previous examples and their associated weights. The confidence level is set at 80%, reflecting the strength of the predictive model based on these factors.",

lived with their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\",
