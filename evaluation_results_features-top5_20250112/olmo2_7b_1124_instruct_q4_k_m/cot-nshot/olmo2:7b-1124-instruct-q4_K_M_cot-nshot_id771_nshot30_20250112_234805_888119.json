The reasoning behind the risk factor weights is as follows:\n\n- **Never married**: This factor has been associated with a higher risk of recidivism in previous examples. It suggests potential issues with relationship stability and social support.\n- **Cohabiting**: While cohabitation can indicate a committed relationship, it may also highlight challenges within a relationship that could affect behavior.\n- **Held 1 job**: Limited employment opportunities or difficulties maintaining employment can be indicative of underlying challenges that might increase the risk of reoffending.\n- **Household size of 2**: Smaller households may imply less social support, which could potentially influence behavior negatively.\n- **Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12**: The lack of information on parental relationship stability makes it a medium-risk factor. It signifies an absence of data on family structure and cohesion.\n\nCombining these factors, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for a three-year rearrest recidivism, with a moderate level of confidence due to the moderate to high weight assigned to each relevant risk factor based on the patterns observed in the examples provided.",
