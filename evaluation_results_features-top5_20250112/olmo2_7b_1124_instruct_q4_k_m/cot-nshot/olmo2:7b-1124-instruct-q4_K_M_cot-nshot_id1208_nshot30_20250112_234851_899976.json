The reasoning behind the weight assignments are as follows:\n\n- **Marital_status_unknown**: High weight - The individual's marital status is unknown, which could indicate they lack stable relationships that might otherwise reduce the risk of reoffending.\n- **Household_size_4**: Medium weight - Living in a household of 4 suggests potentially less individual attention and possibly more stressors without further context to suggest a high-risk environment.\n- **Jobs_held_2**: Medium weight - Having held two jobs may point to a history of job instability, which can correlate with higher risk for recidivism.\n\nThese factors, when collectively considered, lean towards predicting a higher likelihood of reoffending within three years. The confidence level is set at 75 to indicate a strong belief in this prediction based on the available information.",

their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
