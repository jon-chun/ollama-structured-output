The reasoning behind the risk factor assignments is as follows:\n\n- **Never married**: High risk - Studies often associate marriage or cohabitation with reduced criminal behavior due to increased social ties and support.\n- **Not cohabiting**: Medium risk - Cohabitation can provide a stable living arrangement which might reduce the likelihood of recidivism; however, being not cohabiting could imply less stability and support.\n- **Held 3 jobs**: Low risk - Demonstrating adaptability by holding multiple jobs may indicate resilience to stress and a reduced likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n- **Household size of 6**: Low risk - A larger household provides a built-in support network, which is generally associated with lower rates of reoffending.\n- **Lived with both biological parents at age 12**: High risk - An upbringing within a stable, two-parent home is often linked to reduced recidivism due to the structure and values typically provided by such environments.\n\nThese factors collectively point to a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years for this individual.",
