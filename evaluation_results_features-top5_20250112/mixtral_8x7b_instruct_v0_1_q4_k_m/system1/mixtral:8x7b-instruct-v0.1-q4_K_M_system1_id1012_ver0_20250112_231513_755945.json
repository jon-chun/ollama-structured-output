However, given the presence of more mitigating than aggravating factors, I would lean towards predicting a lower risk of involvement in criminal activity, with a confidence level of 60%. It's important to note that any risk assessment based on limited information like this should be considered preliminary and subject to revision as additional information becomes available.",
