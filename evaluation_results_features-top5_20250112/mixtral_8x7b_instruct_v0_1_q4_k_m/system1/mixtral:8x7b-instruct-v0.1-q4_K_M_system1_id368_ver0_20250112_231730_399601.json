Being male, never married, and not cohabiting are not strong indicators of criminality on their own. Having held only one job could suggest instability, but it is just one data point and may not be indicative of a pattern. A household size of 5 and living with both biological parents at age 12 are generally considered positive factors. However, without additional context or risk factors, it is difficult to make a definitive assessment. The confidence level reflects the limited information provided for analysis.",
