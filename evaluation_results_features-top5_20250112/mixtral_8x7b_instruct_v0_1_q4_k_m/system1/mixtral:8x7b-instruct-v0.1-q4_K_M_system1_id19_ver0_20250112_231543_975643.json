Factors such as criminal history, type of crime committed, mental health, and substance abuse should also be considered for a more accurate prediction. The current factors suggest a slightly lower risk due to having a stable household size and upbringing, but being male and never married can contribute to increased risk in certain contexts. However, without additional information, the confidence level is relatively low.",
