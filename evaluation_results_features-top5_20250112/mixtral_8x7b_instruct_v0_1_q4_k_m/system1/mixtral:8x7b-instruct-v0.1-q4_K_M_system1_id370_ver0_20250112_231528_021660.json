Being male, never married, and not cohabiting are neutral or low-risk factors. Having held two jobs suggests stability, and a household size of four could imply a supportive family environment. Living with both biological parents at age 12 is generally a positive factor. However, it's essential to consider additional risk factors, such as criminal history, substance abuse, or antisocial behavior, which would significantly impact the overall risk assessment.",
