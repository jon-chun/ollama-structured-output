This may be indicative of potential disruption in the home environment during formative years, which could contribute to increased risk in later life.\n\nOverall, while there are several potential risk factors present, none of them are definitive by themselves. Therefore, I would assess the overall risk as moderate rather than high, with a confidence level of 60%. However, this assessment should be considered in conjunction with other relevant information and risk factors to form a more complete picture of the individual's potential for criminal behavior.",
