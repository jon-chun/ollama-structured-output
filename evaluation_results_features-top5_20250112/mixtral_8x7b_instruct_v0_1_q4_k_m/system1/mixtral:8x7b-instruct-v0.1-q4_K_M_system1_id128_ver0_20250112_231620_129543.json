It's important to note that risk assessments should be conducted with comprehensive data and an understanding of the individual's history, mental health, and criminal behavior patterns.\n\nBased on this limited information:\n\n1. Male gender might indicate a slightly higher risk compared to females due to crime statistics; however, it is not a strong indicator of high risk in itself.\n2. Never married and not cohabiting may suggest less stability but does not necessarily mean the person poses a high risk.\n3. Holding 2 jobs could indicate some level of instability or difficulties in maintaining employment, which might contribute to stress and frustration leading to criminal behavior, but it is still a weak indicator of high risk.\n4. Household size of 4 may suggest a stable family environment, potentially reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. However, this depends on various factors such as relationships within the household, socioeconomic status, etc.\n5. Living with their biological mother at age 12 with unknown marital status might imply some level of family support and stability; however, it does not provide sufficient information to determine if this is an indicator of high or low risk.\n\nOverall, these factors do not seem to suggest a high-risk individual. However, without more comprehensive data, a definitive assessment cannot be made.",
