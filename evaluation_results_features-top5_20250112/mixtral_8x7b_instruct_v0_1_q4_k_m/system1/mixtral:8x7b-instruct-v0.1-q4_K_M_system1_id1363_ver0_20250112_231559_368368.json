However, based on the provided factors, it does not seem like there are any red flags that would indicate a high risk. Being male, never married, and currently unemployed could potentially increase the risk, but without additional context, these factors alone are not enough to make a definitive assessment. The household size of 4 and living with other adults could suggest some stability, which slightly decreases the risk. Since the biological parent status is unknown, it's impossible to determine if this factor could have any impact on the risk level. Not living in group quarters at age 12 also suggests some stability in the person's background.\n\nOverall, based on the provided information, I would lean towards a low-moderate risk assessment with a confidence level of 60. However, additional factors and context are needed to make a more accurate and confident prediction.",
