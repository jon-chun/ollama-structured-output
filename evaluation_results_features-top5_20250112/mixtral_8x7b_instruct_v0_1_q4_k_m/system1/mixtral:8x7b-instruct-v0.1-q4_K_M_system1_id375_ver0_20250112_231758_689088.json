The unknown marital status at age 12 is also unlikely to have a significant impact on current risk assessment. Therefore, based on these factors alone, I would assess the person as a moderate to low risk. However, it's important to note that a comprehensive risk assessment should take into account many other factors and be conducted by a qualified professional.",
