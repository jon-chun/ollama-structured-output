Being female, married, and living with both biological parents at age 12 are typically associated with lower risk levels. However, unemployment could be a potential concern if it's related to criminal behavior or substance abuse. Nonetheless, without further information about the individual's past criminal history, mental health, or other relevant factors, it is difficult to classify her as high-risk with high confidence.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 60 because while these risk factors generally indicate lower risk levels, some uncertainty remains due to the lack of complete information about the individual's circumstances and behavior.",
