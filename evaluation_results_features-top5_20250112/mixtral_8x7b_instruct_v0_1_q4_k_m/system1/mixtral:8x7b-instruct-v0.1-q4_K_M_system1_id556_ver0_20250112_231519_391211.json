The fact that marital status is unknown at age 12 does not seem to be particularly relevant in assessing current risk. However, it's important to note that risk assessment is a complex process that requires considering many different factors and cannot be reduced to a simple yes or no answer. Therefore, my confidence level is only moderate.",
