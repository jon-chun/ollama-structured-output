The person's marital status at age 12, which is unknown, could potentially have an impact on their risk assessment if there were any known issues or incidents during that time. However, based solely on the information provided, I would rate the confidence of this prediction as moderate.\n\nIt is important to note that a comprehensive risk assessment should consider many other factors beyond what was mentioned here, including criminal history, drug use, mental health, and other social and environmental factors.",
