(Confidence: 30)\n- Lack of marital status and cohabitation may suggest instability or lack of support, increasing the risk level slightly. (Confidence: 20)\n- Unemployment can contribute to financial stress, which is sometimes linked to criminal behavior. However, unemployment alone does not necessarily indicate high risk. (Confidence: 15)\n- A larger household size could potentially increase the likelihood of conflict and tension, but this depends on various factors such as family dynamics and relationships. (Confidence: 10)\n- Living with a biological mother at age 12 with unknown marital status might suggest some level of familial instability or disruption, which could be a risk factor. However, more information is needed to make a conclusive assessment. (Confidence: 35)\n\nOverall, while these factors do indicate some level of risk, the confidence in this prediction is relatively low due to the lack of clear evidence for criminal intent or behavior.",
