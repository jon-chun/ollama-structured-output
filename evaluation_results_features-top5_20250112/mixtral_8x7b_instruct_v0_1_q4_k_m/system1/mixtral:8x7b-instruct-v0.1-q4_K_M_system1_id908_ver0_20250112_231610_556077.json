The fact that this individual has maintained employment and lived with their biological mother in a stable household size of four is actually indicative of a more stable upbringing, which can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. Additionally, there is no information regarding any involvement in criminal activity or other concerning behaviors. However, it is important to note that risk assessment is complex and cannot be determined by a few factors alone. Therefore, my confidence level is only 60%.",
