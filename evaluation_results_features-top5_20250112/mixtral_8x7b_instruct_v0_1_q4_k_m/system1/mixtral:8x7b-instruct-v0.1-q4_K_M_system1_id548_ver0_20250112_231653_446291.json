The individual has lived with a biological family member, indicating a possible support system, and has a moderate household size. Additionally, the person's marital status at age 12 is unknown, which could suggest a variety of different upbringings and experiences.\n\nOverall, while further information would be helpful in making a more accurate assessment, based on the available risk factors I would predict a low to moderate level of risk with a confidence level of 60.",
