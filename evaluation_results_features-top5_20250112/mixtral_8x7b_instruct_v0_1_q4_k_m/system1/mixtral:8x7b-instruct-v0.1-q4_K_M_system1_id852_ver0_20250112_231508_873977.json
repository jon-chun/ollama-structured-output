The presence of a stable family environment, including living with a biological parent at age 12 and having a household size of 3, may actually be protective factors that reduce the likelihood of criminal involvement. However, it is important to note that risk assessment is a complex process that involves considering many different factors, and no single factor can provide a definitive answer. Therefore, while my confidence in this prediction is relatively high (60 out of 100), there is still some uncertainty involved.",
