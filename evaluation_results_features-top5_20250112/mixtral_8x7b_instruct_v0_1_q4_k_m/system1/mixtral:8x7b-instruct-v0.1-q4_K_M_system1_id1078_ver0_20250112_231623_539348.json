The fact that this individual lived with their biological mother at age 12, has a household size of 3, and is not cohabiting may actually be protective factors. Additionally, the absence of information about the person's marital status at age 12 means that we cannot make any assumptions about the stability of their childhood home environment.\n\nTherefore, based on this limited set of risk factors, I would assess the individual as having a moderate to low risk of involvement in criminal activity, with a confidence level of 70%. However, it's important to note that risk assessment is a complex and multifaceted process, and should always take into account a wide range of factors beyond just those listed here.",
