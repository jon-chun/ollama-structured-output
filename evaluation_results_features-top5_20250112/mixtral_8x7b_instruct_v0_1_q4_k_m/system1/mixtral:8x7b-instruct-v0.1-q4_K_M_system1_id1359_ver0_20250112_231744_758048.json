The marital status of the mother is unknown, which could potentially impact the overall risk assessment if the mother's status is also a factor in the analysis. However, based on the information provided, my confidence level for a \"NO\" prediction (meaning low risk) is 70 out of 100. It is important to note that risk assessments should always be conducted with a comprehensive and individualized approach, taking into account all relevant factors and contexts.",
