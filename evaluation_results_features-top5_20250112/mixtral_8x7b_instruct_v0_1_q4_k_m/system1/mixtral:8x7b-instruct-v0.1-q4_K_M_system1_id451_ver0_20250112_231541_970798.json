The presence of a stable household size and a known caregiver at age 12 are positive indicators. However, the marital status being unknown at age 12 could be a potential red flag, but without additional information it is difficult to determine its significance. Therefore, I would rate the overall risk as moderate, hence a confidence level of 60%.",
