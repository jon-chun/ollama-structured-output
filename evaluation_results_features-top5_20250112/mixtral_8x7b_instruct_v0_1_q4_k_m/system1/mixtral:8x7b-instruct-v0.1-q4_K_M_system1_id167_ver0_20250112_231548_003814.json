These include having a relatively small household size, living with a biological family member, and not cohabiting with a partner. Additionally, the fact that their marital status at age 12 is unknown does not provide enough information to make a definitive assessment of risk. Overall, while further investigation may be warranted, I would rate this individual's risk as moderate to low, with a confidence level of 70.",
