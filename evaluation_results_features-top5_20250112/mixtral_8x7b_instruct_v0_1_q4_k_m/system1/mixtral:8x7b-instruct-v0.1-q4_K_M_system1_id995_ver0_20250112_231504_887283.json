The fact that they lived with their biological father and had a stable family structure during childhood is a positive sign. Additionally, the person's cohabiting status and never being married are not necessarily risk factors on their own. Overall, while it's impossible to predict criminal behavior with absolute certainty, I would rate this individual as a moderate-low risk based on these factors alone. However, it's important to note that a comprehensive risk assessment should take into account many other factors beyond just demographics and family background.",
