The fact that this individual has held two jobs, lives with their biological father (whose marital status is unknown), and has a household size of three are all positive indicators that may suggest stability in their life. Additionally, the fact that they lived with their biological father at age 12 suggests some degree of family continuity.\n\nOverall, while it's important to consider these risk factors when assessing an individual's potential for criminal behavior, there is not enough information provided here to make a definitive assessment. As such, I would rate the confidence in this prediction as moderate rather than high.",
