However, given that there is no prior history of criminal activity or other concerning risk factors, I believe this person has a low-to-moderate risk of engaging in criminal behavior. My confidence level is at 70% because individual circumstances and life events can still impact an individual's likelihood to engage in criminal behavior. It's important to reassess these factors over time for a more accurate prediction.",
