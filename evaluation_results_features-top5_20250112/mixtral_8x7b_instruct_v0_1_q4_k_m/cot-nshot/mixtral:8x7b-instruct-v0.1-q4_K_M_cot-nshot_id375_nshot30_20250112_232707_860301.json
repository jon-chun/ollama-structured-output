Based on these factors, my prediction is that this individual has a low-to-medium risk of recidivism and is therefore unlikely to be rearrested within the next three years. However, I must emphasize that this is only an estimate, as each case is unique and there are always exceptions to general trends. My confidence in this prediction is 60 out of 100.",
