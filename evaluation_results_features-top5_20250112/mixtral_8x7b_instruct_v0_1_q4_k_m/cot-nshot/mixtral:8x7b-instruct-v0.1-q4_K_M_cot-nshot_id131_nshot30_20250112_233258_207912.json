Here is my analysis:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Male gender has been associated with slightly higher rates of recidivism, but it is not a strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Being never married has been linked to higher rates of recidivism, as it may indicate a lack of social support and stability.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting is not a strong predictor of recidivism on its own, but can be combined with other factors to assess risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"medium\", \"Being currently unemployed has been linked to higher rates of recidivism, as it may indicate a lack of structure and purpose in daily life.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"A household size of 4 is not a strong predictor of recidivism on its own, but can be combined with other factors to assess risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\nBased on the above analysis, I would predict that this person has a moderately elevated risk of rearrest within the next 3 years.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
