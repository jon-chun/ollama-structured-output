The third factor is assigned a medium weight because it may indicate some level of instability or lack of opportunities, but it is still not a strong indicator of recidivism on its own.\n\nBased on these risk factors and their weights, I predict that the person will not be rearrested within three years. However, I must acknowledge that there are many factors at play in determining whether someone will reoffend, and this prediction is based only on the limited information provided here. My confidence level for this prediction is 70 out of 100, indicating that while I believe that a non-recidivism outcome is more likely than not, there is still some uncertainty involved.",

the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
