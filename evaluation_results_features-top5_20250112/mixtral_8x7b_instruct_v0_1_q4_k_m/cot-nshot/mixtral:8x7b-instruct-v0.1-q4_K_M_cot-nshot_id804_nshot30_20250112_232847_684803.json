My confidence level is 70 out of 100, as being divorced does slightly increase the risk, but overall the other factors are low risk.\n\nHere is the JSON object:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Slightly lower rates of recidivism for females\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"May indicate past legal issues or instability\"),\n    (\"Living arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Larger households can provide support and stability\"),\n    (\"Childhood living situation\", \"low\", \"Does not indicate any negative factors\"),\n    (\"Parental marital status at age 12\", \"low\", \"Not a relevant factor for recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
