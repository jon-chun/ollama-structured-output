Overall, I predict that this person will not be rearrested within the next 3 years with 70% confidence, based on the given examples and the assigned weights to each risk factor. However, it is essential to note that the actual outcome may differ due to various unpredictable factors.",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting

using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 3 jobs with a household size of 6.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
