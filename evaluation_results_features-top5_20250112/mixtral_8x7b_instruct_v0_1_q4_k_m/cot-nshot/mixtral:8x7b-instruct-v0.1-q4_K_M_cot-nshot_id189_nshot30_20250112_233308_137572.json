    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll do my best to assign a relative weight to each risk factor based on the given examples and provide a prediction for the new case. Here are the weighted risk factors for the new case:\n```json\n{\n    \"risk_factors\": [\n        (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender has a higher recidivism rate than female in general\"),\n        (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being married may reduce the risk of recidivism, but not always\"),\n        (\"spouse_present\", \"low\", \"Having a spouse present may provide some support and stability\"),\n        (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can increase the risk of recidivism due to financial stressors\"),\n        (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Larger household size may indicate more social support, but also potential stressors\"),\n        (\"lived_with_both_biological_parents\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents is not a strong predictor of recidivism\")\n    ],\n    \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n    \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* Gender (medium): Based on the given examples, males have a higher recidivism rate than females. Therefore, I assign medium risk to this factor.\n* Marital status (low): While being married may reduce the risk of recidivism, it is not always the case. Therefore, I assign low risk to this factor.\n* Spouse present (low): Having a spouse present may provide some support and stability, but it does not necessarily mean that the individual will not reoffend. Therefore, I assign low risk to this factor.\n* Unemployment (medium): Unemployment can increase the risk of recidivism due to financial stressors. Based on the given examples, unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Therefore, I assign medium risk to this factor.\n* Household size (low): Larger household size may indicate more social support, but it also means more potential stressors. However, based on the given examples, household size is not a strong predictor of recidivism. Therefore, I assign low risk to this factor.\n* Lived with both biological parents (low): Growing up with both biological parents is not a strong predictor of recidivism based on the given examples. Therefore, I assign low risk to this factor.\n\nPrediction: Based on the weighted risk factors, I predict that there is a 60% chance that the individual will be rearrested within three years.",
