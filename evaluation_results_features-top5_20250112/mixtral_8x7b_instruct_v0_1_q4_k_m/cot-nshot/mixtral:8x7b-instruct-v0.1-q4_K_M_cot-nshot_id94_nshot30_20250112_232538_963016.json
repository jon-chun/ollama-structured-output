    "raw_message_text": "Here's my analysis of the risk factors and prediction for the given case:\n\nFactors that are similar to the case in question:\n\n* Being male (in many examples, males have a higher rate of recidivism)\n* Never married\n* Not cohabiting\n* Currently unemployed\n* Household size of 3\n* Lived with their biological mother at age 12\n\nUsing the above factors that are similar to the case in question, I would assign relative weights as follows:\n\n* Gender (male): medium risk - research suggests that males have a higher recidivism rate than females\n* Marital status (never married): low risk - there's no clear pattern related to marital status and recidivism in the examples\n* Cohabitation status (not cohabiting): low risk - there's no clear pattern related to cohabitation status and recidivism in the examples\n* Employment status (unemployed): high risk - unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism based on the examples\n* Household size (3): medium risk - household size of 3 is associated with both positive and negative outcomes, but it leans more towards being a risk factor based on the examples\n* Living arrangement at age 12 (lived with their biological mother): low risk - there's no clear pattern related to living arrangements at age 12 and recidivism in the examples\n\nNow, using these weighted factors, here is my prediction for the case:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have a higher recidivism rate compared to females\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern related to marital status and recidivism in the examples\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern related to cohabitation status and recidivism in the examples\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism based on the examples\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium\", \"Household size of 3 leans more towards being a risk factor based on the examples\"),\n    (\"Living arrangement at age 12\", \"low\", \"No clear pattern related to living arrangements at age 12 and recidivism in the examples\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\nMy prediction is that there is a 70% chance of recidivism within 3 years for this case, based on the weighted risk factors.",
