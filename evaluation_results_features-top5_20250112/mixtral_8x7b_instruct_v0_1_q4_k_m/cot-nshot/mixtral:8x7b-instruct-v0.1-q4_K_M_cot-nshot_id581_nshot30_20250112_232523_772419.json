    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll do my best to analyze the risk factors and predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Here is my assessment:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"being never married\", \"low\", \"This factor alone is not strongly indicative of recidivism, as many people who have never been married do not have criminal records.\"),\n    (\"cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Cohabiting could suggest a lack of stability or community ties, which may be linked to higher rates of recidivism in some cases. However, it is important to consider other factors as well.\"),\n    (\"holding 4 jobs\", \"low\", \"Having held multiple jobs is not necessarily indicative of recidivism, and could reflect a variety of circumstances such as seeking better employment opportunities or experiencing job instability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* \"Being never married\" is a low-risk factor for recidivism, as it does not have a strong correlation with criminal behavior on its own.\n* \"Cohabiting\" is a medium-risk factor because it could suggest a lack of stability or community ties, but it is important to consider other factors in combination with this one.\n* \"Holding 4 jobs\" is a low-risk factor for recidivism, as it does not have a clear connection to criminal behavior and could reflect various non-criminal circumstances.\n\nBased on these risk factors and the overall pattern of the examples provided, I predict that this person will not be rearrested within 3 years, with a confidence level of 70%. However, it is important to note that individual outcomes can vary widely and that this prediction should not be used as definitive evidence of future behavior.",
