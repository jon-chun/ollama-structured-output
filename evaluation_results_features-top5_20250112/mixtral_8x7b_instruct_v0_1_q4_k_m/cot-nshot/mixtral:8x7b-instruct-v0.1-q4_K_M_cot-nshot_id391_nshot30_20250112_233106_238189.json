However, there are other factors that may also contribute to their likelihood of reoffending, such as criminal history and substance abuse issues, which were not provided in the question. Therefore, my confidence level is 70%.",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
