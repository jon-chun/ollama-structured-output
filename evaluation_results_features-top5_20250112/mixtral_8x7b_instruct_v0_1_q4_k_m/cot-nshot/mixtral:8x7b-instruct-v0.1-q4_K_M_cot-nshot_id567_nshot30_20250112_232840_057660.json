    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the risk factors and my prediction for the outcome:\n\nFactors that I am considering as potential risk factors are:\n\n* Gender (male)\n* Marital status (married, spouse present)\n* Number of jobs\n* Household size\n* Living situation at age 12\n\nBased on the examples provided, it seems like gender may have some influence on recidivism risk, with males being more likely to reoffend. However, many other factors are also at play. Marital status may be a protective factor, as having a spouse present could potentially provide additional support and stability in an individual's life. The number of jobs held is not consistently associated with recidivism risk, but it may indicate some level of employment instability. Household size seems to have little effect on recidivism risk, except in cases where it is very high or very low. Living situation at age 12 also appears to be a relatively weak factor.\n\nBased on these considerations, I would assign the following weights to each risk factor for this case:\n\n* Gender (male): medium risk\n* Marital status (married, spouse present): low risk\n* Number of jobs (2): low risk\n* Household size (3): low risk\n* Living situation at age 12 (lived with biological mother, marital status unknown): low risk\n\nOverall, I would assess the individual in this case as having a relatively low recidivism risk. My prediction is that they will not be rearrested within the next three years. Based on the information provided and my analysis of the risk factors, I am assigning a confidence level of 70% to this prediction.\n\nHere is the JSON object with my prediction:\n```\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender has been associated with a higher risk of recidivism in some cases.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and having a spouse present may be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"number of jobs\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs does not seem to significantly affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 3 does not seem to affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation at age 12\", \"low\", \"Living with the biological mother at age 12 does not seem to be a strong predictor of recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
