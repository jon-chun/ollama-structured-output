However, the specific distribution of ages and relationships within this large household is not provided.\n* Living with their biological mother (low) - In general, living with a relative might be considered a positive factor, but without further context, it is difficult to assign much weight to this risk factor.\n* Marital status unknown for age 12 (low) - The marital status of the individual's caregiver at age 12 does not seem to have a significant impact on recidivism based on the examples provided.\n\nNext, I will provide the collective assessment and prediction in the requested JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Holding one job\", \"medium\", \"Multiple instances of recidivism among individuals with only one job\"),\n    (\"Being never married\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation between marriage and reduced recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation between cohabitation and reduced recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"Household size of 9\", \"medium\", \"Larger households might have more complex dynamics, potentially increasing stress levels\"),\n    (\"Living with biological mother at age 12\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation between living arrangements at age 12 and recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"Marital status unknown for caregiver at age 12\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation between caregiver's marital status at age 12 and recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n\nThis assessment is based on the given examples, which might not be representative of the general population.

outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
