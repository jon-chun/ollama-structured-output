    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis:\n\n* Being female is a protective factor, as females generally have lower rates of recidivism than males. I would assign this a low negative weight.\n* Never being married is not a strong predictor of recidivism, but it might indicate a lack of social support. I would assign this a low positive weight.\n* Not cohabiting is also not a strong predictor, but it might indicate a lack of stability in housing and relationships. I would assign this a low positive weight.\n* Being currently unemployed is a risk factor for recidivism. People who are not working are more likely to turn to criminal activity to support themselves. I would assign this a medium positive weight.\n* A household size of 5 might indicate a large and potentially chaotic living situation, which could increase the risk of recidivism. However, it could also mean that there is a strong support network available. I would assign this a low positive weight.\n* Living with both biological parents at age 12 is a protective factor, as it suggests a stable upbringing and strong family ties. I would assign this a low negative weight.\n\nBased on these risk factors, my prediction is NO, with a confidence level of 70%. This person has some risk factors for recidivism, but they also have some protective factors that might help them avoid reoffending. However, it's important to note that individual circumstances can vary widely, and this prediction should not be taken as definitive.\n\nHere is the JSON object:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never being married might indicate a lack of social support.\"),\n    (\"cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting might indicate a lack of stability in housing and relationships.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Being currently unemployed is a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"A household size of 5 might indicate a large and potentially chaotic living situation.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents at age 12 is a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
