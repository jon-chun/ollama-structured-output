    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the risk factors for the given case:\n\n* Gender: Male. This factor is neutral, as both male and female individuals can have similar likelihoods of recidivism with other factors being equal.\n* Marital status: Never married. This factor could be considered low-medium risk, as research has shown that being unmarried can increase the likelihood of recidivism due to lack of social support.\n* Cohabiting: Yes. This factor is a medium risk, as cohabiting with a partner can sometimes lead to a less stable living situation and increased stress, both of which could contribute to recidivism.\n* Number of jobs held: 3. This factor is low risk, as having multiple jobs can indicate stability and responsibility, decreasing the likelihood of recidivism.\n* Household size: 3. This factor is low-medium risk, as larger household sizes can sometimes lead to increased stress and instability, but this depends on many other factors such as family dynamics and financial situation.\n* Living arrangement at age 12: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown. This factor is neutral, as it does not provide clear information about the individual's upbringing or potential risk factors.\n\nBased on these risk factors and their assigned weights, I would predict a low-medium risk of recidivism for this individual. However, it is important to note that predicting recidivism is complex and multifaceted, and no single factor can accurately predict an individual's likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHere is the JSON object format prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk\\_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Both male and female individuals can have similar likelihoods of recidivism with other factors being equal.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low-medium\", \"Being unmarried can increase the likelihood of recidivism due to lack of social support.\"),\n    (\"Cohabiting\", \"medium\", \"Cohabiting with a partner can sometimes lead to a less stable living situation and increased stress.\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held\", \"low\", \"Having multiple jobs can indicate stability and responsibility, decreasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low-medium\", \"Larger household sizes can sometimes lead to increased stress and instability, but this depends on many other factors.\"),\n    (\"Living arrangement at age 12\", \"neutral\", \"Does not provide clear information about the individual's upbringing or potential risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
