    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the risk factors for the given case, along with a prediction and confidence level:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status: never married\", \"low\", \"Stable relationships may reduce the likelihood of recidivism, but this is a weak factor.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation: no\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not necessarily increase the risk of recidivism, but it can indicate a lack of social support.\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held: 4\", \"medium\", \"Having held multiple jobs in the past may indicate instability or difficulty adapting to new situations.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Marital status: never married: This is a weak risk factor, as stable relationships may reduce the likelihood of recidivism. However, being single does not automatically increase the risk.\n* Cohabitation: no: Living alone is not a strong indicator of recidivism, but it can suggest a lack of social support, which could potentially increase the risk.\n* Number of jobs held: 4: This factor indicates some level of instability or difficulty adapting to new situations. In general, employment stability is associated with reduced recidivism, so having held multiple jobs in the past may increase the risk. However, this factor alone does not necessarily imply a high risk.\n\nBased on these factors and their relative weights, I predict that the person has a low-to-medium risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism, with a confidence level of 70%.",
