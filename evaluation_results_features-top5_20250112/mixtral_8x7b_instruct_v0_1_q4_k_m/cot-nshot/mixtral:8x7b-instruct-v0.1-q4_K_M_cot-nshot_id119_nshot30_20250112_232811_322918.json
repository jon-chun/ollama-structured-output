Therefore, we need to analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor based on our understanding of their impact on recidivism.\nIn this particular case, being never married and not cohabiting are not strong indicators of recidivism since they do not have a direct relationship with criminal behavior. However, having held only one job might be a medium-risk factor because stable employment can reduce the likelihood of recidivism for some individuals, but it depends on various other factors such as criminal history and the nature of the crime.\nBased on this analysis, I would assign \"low\" weight to being never married and not cohabiting, and \"medium\" weight to holding only one job. The overall prediction is \"NO\" (meaning there will be no rearrest recidivism), with a confidence level of 60%. This confidence level takes into account the uncertainty in predicting human behavior and the limited information provided for this specific case.\n```",
