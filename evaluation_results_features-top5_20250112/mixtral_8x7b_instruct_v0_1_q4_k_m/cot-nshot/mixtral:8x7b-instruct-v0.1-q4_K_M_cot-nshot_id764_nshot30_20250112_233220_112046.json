Here's the JSON object format response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males tend to have higher recidivism rates than females.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \"Never being married has been associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation status\", \"low\", \"There doesn't seem to be a clear trend related to cohabitation status and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held\", \"low\", \"Holding more jobs is not necessarily a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"medium\", \"Moderate household sizes seem to be associated with moderate rates of recidivism, but there are exceptions.\"),\n    (\"Living arrangement at age 12\", \"low\", \"Living arrangements at age 12 don't seem to have a strong correlation with recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 55\n}\n```\nNote that the confidence level is subjective and should not be interpreted as an absolute prediction.",
