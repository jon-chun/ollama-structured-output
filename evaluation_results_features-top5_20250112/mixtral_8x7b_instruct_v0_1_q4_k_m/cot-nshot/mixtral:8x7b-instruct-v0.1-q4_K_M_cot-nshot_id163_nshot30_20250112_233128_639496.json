However, holding multiple jobs can also be a positive factor if it shows a willingness to work and improve one's situation.\"),\n    (\"Household size: 4\", \"low\", \"Living in a larger household may provide more social support and stability, but it could also lead to increased stress or conflict in some cases.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nIn this case, I have assigned medium weight to the risk factor of holding multiple jobs, and low weight to the other factors. Based on these risk factors, my prediction is that there is a 70% likelihood that this person will not be rearrested within the next 3 years. However, it's important to note that individual circumstances can vary widely, and this analysis should only be used as a rough guide.",
