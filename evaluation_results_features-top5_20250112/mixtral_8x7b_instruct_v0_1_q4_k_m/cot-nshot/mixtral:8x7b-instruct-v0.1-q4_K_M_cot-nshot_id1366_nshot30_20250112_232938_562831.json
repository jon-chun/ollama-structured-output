The only factor that I assigned a medium weight to is the number of jobs held, as it could indicate unstable employment, which might be a weak predictor of recidivism. Based on these weighted risk factors, I predict that there will be no rearrest within 3 years with a confidence level of 75%.",

their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
