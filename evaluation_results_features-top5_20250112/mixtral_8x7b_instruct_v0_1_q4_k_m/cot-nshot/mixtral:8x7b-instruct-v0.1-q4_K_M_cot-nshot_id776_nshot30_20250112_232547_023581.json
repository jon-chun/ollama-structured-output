    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll do my best to assign a relative weight to each risk factor based on the given examples and provide a prediction with a confidence level for the new case. Here are the risk factors and their weights for the new case:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender has a higher recidivism rate than female.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Being never married is a low-risk factor, as it does not seem to significantly affect recidivism in the examples.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting is a low-risk factor, as it does not seem to significantly affect recidivism in the examples.\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs held\", \"medium\", \"Having held 2 jobs is a medium-risk factor, as having only one job seems to be a low-risk factor, and holding more than 2 jobs seems to be a high-risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Having a household size of 4 is a low-risk factor, as it does not seem to significantly affect recidivism in the examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nExplanation:\nI have assigned a medium weight to the gender risk factor because males generally have a higher recidivism rate than females. I have assigned a low weight to marital status and cohabitation since they don't seem to significantly affect recidivism in the given examples. The number of jobs held is a medium-risk factor as having only one job seems to be a low-risk factor, and holding more than 2 jobs seems to be a high-risk factor. Lastly, I have assigned a low weight to household size since it does not seem to significantly affect recidivism in the examples.\nBased on these risk factors, my prediction is that there is a 70% chance of no rearrest in the next three years.",
