    "raw_message_text": "ertainly, based on the given examples, I will assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for the case of a male who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 2 jobs with a household size of 9 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12. Here are my assessments:\n\n* Having multiple jobs in the past (2 jobs) could be indicative of some instability or difficulty settling down in a single job, which may lead to increased stress and potential legal issues. However, since having two jobs is not too excessive, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n* Being never married suggests that this individual does not have an intimate partner who might encourage prosocial behavior or provide emotional support during challenging times. This factor, being never married, could increase the likelihood of social isolation and contribute to criminal behavior. Therefore, it is assigned a medium weight.\n* Having a large household size (9) may suggest that this individual grew up in a complex family environment with many siblings or relatives. While having a big family can be beneficial in terms of social support and resources, it could also lead to conflicts and stressful situations. Considering the size is quite large, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n* The fact that this person lived with both biological parents at age 12 is generally a positive sign, as it suggests a stable family environment during childhood. This factor may reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior in adulthood. Therefore, it is assigned a low weight.\n\nTaking these factors into account and their respective weights, I will now provide a prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs suggest some instability in employment.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Being never married may increase social isolation and contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"high\", \"A large household size can lead to conflicts and stressful situations.\"),\n    (\"Lived with Both Biological Parents at Age 12\", \"low\", \"This factor suggests a stable family environment during childhood.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\nIn this prediction, I have assigned a confidence level of 70 based on the factors discussed above. While there are some risk factors present (e.g., multiple jobs and large household size), the fact that this individual lived with both biological parents at age 12 provides a more optimistic outlook, leading to a relatively high confidence in a \"NO\" prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. However, it is important to note that individual behavior can be complex and influenced by various unpredictable factors, so this prediction should not be taken as definitive.",
