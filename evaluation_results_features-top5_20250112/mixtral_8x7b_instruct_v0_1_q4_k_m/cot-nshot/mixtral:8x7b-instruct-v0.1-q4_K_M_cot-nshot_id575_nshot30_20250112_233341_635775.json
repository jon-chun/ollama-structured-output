While some factors (such as gender) are known to have only a moderate impact on recidivism, others (such as the number of jobs held) are more strongly associated with an increased likelihood of reoffending.\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict that the individual in question will be rearrested within the next three years. However, it is important to note that my confidence in this prediction is only moderate, as recidivism is influenced by a wide range of factors and cannot be accurately predicted with certainty based on a few risk factors alone.",
