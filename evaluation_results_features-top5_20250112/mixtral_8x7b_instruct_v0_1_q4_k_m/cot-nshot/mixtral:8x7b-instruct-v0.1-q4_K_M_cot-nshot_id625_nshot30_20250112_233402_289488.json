    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the risk factors and prediction for the given case:\n\n* Job stability: The person has held only one job, which can be a sign of instability or lack of career development. This could also indicate that the individual struggles with finding and maintaining employment, which is a common factor among individuals who reoffend. I would rate this as medium risk.\n* Marital status: The person is not married, which is a neutral factor since marital status alone does not have a strong correlation with recidivism rates. I would rate this as low risk.\n* Cohabitation: The person is not cohabiting, which is also a neutral factor since there is no clear evidence showing that cohabitation affects recidivism rates. I would rate this as low risk.\n* Household size: The household size is three, which can be a sign of instability or lack of support if the person's relationships with their family members are strained. However, living with a biological father who was present at age 12 could also indicate a positive family relationship and support system. I would rate this as low risk.\n\nBased on these factors, my analysis is:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Job stability\", \"medium\", \"History of only holding one job may indicate instability or difficulty finding employment\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Being never married is a neutral factor in predicting recidivism\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting is a neutral factor in predicting recidivism\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Living with three people can be a sign of instability or lack of support, but living with a biological father who was present at age 12 may indicate a positive family relationship and support system\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\nNote that while I tried to consider the provided examples in my analysis, there is no clear pattern or correlation between the risk factors and recidivism outcomes shown in the examples. Therefore, I based my analysis on general knowledge and research about factors that can contribute to recidivism. Additionally, my confidence level is moderate since this analysis is based on limited information and the true outcome may be influenced by other unknown factors.",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
