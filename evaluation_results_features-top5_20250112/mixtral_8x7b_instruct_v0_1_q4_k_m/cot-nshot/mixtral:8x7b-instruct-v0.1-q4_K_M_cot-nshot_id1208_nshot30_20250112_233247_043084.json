    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll analyze the risk factors for each example and provide a relative weight (low, medium, high) along with my reasoning. Then, I will use that information to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the given case.\n1. History of employment: The person has held 2 jobs which is a medium risk factor since holding multiple jobs could suggest instability or difficulties in maintaining employment.\n2. Household size: A household size of 4 can be considered a low risk factor as it suggests a stable living environment with potential social support.\n3. Age 12 living situation: The person lived with their biological mother, and the marital status is unknown. This is a medium risk factor since unstable family structures during childhood might impact future behavior.\n\nNow, applying this analysis to the given case:\n\n* History of employment: Held 2 jobs (medium)\n* Household size: 4 (low)\n* Age 12 living situation: Lived with their biological mother, marital status unknown (medium)\n\nBased on these risk factors, I predict a \"NO\" for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. The person has had some employment history and lives in a stable household with a medium risk factor of unstable family structure during childhood. Overall, the risk factors don't indicate high potential for recidivism.\n\nHere is the JSON object response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"History of employment\", \"medium\", \"Held 2 jobs\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"A household size of 4\"),\n    (\"Age 12 living situation\", \"medium\", \"Lived with their biological mother, marital status unknown\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
