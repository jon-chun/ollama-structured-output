    "raw_message_text": "Sure, I'll analyze the risk factors for the given case and assign a relative weight to each factor before using them to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Here is my assessment:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender has been found to have lower recidivism rates compared to male counterparts, but this factor alone is not enough to make a conclusive decision.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Being never married is not a strong indicator of recidivism risk. However, research shows that stable relationships can contribute to reduced reoffending rates.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation Status\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting does not necessarily imply higher recidivism. Many individuals without cohabitation arrangements do not reoffend.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs Held\", \"medium\", \"Having held 3 jobs could indicate some level of stability, but frequent job changes might also suggest instability or difficulties adapting to employment.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household with 4 members might not significantly impact recidivism risk. However, larger households may have more stressors and challenges that could potentially contribute to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Parental Relationship\", \"medium\", \"Living with the biological dad can be beneficial for reducing recidivism if he is a positive influence in the individual's life. But unknown marital status might imply a lack of stability or support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nBased on these risk factors, I predict that this person has a low to medium risk of recidivism and would likely not be rearrested within the next three years. However, it is essential to note that other factors, such as criminal history, age, mental health, substance abuse, and community support, may also significantly impact recidivism risk. This assessment is based on the given information only and should be used with caution when making any actual predictions or decisions regarding an individual's reoffending likelihood.",
