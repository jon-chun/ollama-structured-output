    "raw_message_text": "Here is my analysis of the risk factors for the given case:\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender has a higher recidivism rate than female.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \"Being never married is a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Number of jobs\", \"medium\", \"Having held only 2 jobs could indicate instability, but is not a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 is not a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Lived with at age 12\", \"medium\", \"Living with a single parent at age 12 could be a risk factor, but it depends on the circumstances.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* Gender is a medium-level risk factor because males generally have higher recidivism rates than females. However, this is not the only factor to consider.\n* Marital status is a high-level risk factor because being never married is associated with a higher risk of recidivism. This suggests that the individual may lack social support and stability.\n* Cohabitation is a low-level risk factor because living alone or not cohabiting is not a strong predictor of recidivism. However, it could indicate a lack of social support.\n* Number of jobs is a medium-level risk factor because holding only 2 jobs could suggest instability in employment history. However, this is not a very strong predictor on its own.\n* Household size is a low-level risk factor because living in a household of size 4 is not generally associated with recidivism.\n* Living with at age 12 is a medium-level risk factor because living with only one parent at age 12 could be a risk factor for recidivism, but it depends on the circumstances.\n\nBased on these factors, I predict that the individual has a NO risk of recidivism within the next 3 years, with a confidence level of 70%. However, this prediction is not definitive and should be considered in conjunction with other information about the individual's situation.",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
