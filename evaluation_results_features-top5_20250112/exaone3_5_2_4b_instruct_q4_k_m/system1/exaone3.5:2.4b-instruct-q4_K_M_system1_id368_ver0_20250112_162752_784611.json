A comprehensive risk assessment requires significantly more data points, including:\n\n* **Crime history:** Any past offenses?\n* **Current criminal activity:** Are there signs of ongoing delinquency?\n* **Financial situation:** Debt, resources available.\n* **Social support:** Relationships, community involvement.\n* **Mental health:** Presence of underlying conditions impacting judgment or behavior.",
