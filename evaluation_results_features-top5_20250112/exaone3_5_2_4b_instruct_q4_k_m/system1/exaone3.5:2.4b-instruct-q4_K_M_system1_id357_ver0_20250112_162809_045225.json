Here's why:\n\n* **Age:** Living situation and parental care until age 12 suggest stability during formative years.\n* **Household Size:**  A household of five points towards potential support systems.\n* **Job History:** Two jobs could indicate adaptability or a desire for financial independence, though past instability doesn't guarantee future risk.\n\n**Important Note:** This assessment is based solely on limited information. A comprehensive risk assessment would require significantly more data points across various domains (psychological, socioeconomic, behavioral) for a nuanced evaluation.",
