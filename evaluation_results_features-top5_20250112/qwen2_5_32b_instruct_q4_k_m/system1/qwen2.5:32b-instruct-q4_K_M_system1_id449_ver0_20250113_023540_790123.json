Being male and never married are somewhat associated with higher criminal risk, but the individual is cohabiting which can be a stabilizing factor. Holding two jobs suggests employment stability, which generally reduces risk. Living in a household of four including biological mother indicates some form of family structure that may provide support. However, limited information on current living situation and marital status at age 12 introduces uncertainty, leading to moderate confidence.",
