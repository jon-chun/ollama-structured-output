Being male and never married does increase some risk according to certain models but isn't definitive. Holding one job could imply stability, as can living with a biological parent. However, the large household size (6 people) might suggest potential instability or economic stressors which could be a concern. The lack of information about the mother's marital status and other details reduce confidence in this assessment.",
