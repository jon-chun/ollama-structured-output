While unemployment can be a factor associated with criminal activity due to financial strain, the individual's gender (female) and family background (living with biological mother during a formative age) tend to correlate with lower risk of criminal involvement. Additionally, living in a household of four without cohabitation does not inherently suggest high-risk behavior without additional context such as economic stability or prior offenses. Thus, the prediction leans towards low risk but with moderate confidence due to limited information.",
