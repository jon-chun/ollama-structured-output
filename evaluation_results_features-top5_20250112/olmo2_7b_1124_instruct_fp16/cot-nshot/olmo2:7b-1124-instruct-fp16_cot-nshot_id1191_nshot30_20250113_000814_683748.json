The combination of being never married, not cohabiting, holding one job, living in a household of five, and residing with their biological mother (with an unknown marital status) points towards a greater risk than observed in many examples provided. However, there is some degree of uncertainty (medium confidence level), as individual cases can vary significantly.",

their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
