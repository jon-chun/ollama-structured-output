The rationale for each weight is outlined in the \"textual reasoning\" field. For example, never being married carries a high weight due to previous examples where unmarried individuals were more likely to recidivate. Holding multiple jobs (3) is assigned a lower weight because the number of jobs changes is not as significant as other factors like marital status and living arrangements. The household size of 2 is given a medium weight, indicating that a smaller support network could potentially increase risk. However, the uncertainty introduced by the \"marital status unknown\" status reduces this factor's overall impact, placing it as low. The prediction concludes with \"YES\" and a confidence level of 65%, reflecting a substantial but not absolute certainty in this outcome.",

outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
