This prediction is grounded in the reasoning that factors such as being never married (high risk), not cohabiting (medium risk), holding two jobs which could indicate instability (medium risk), and a household size of four suggesting less familial supervision than a larger household size (low risk) collectively suggest an increased likelihood of recidivism.",
