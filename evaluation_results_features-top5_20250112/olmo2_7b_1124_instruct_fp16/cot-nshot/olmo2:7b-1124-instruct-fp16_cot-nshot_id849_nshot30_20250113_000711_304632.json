The confidence in this prediction is set at 75%. This judgment is derived from the significant weight given to the individual being \"never married,\" which has been highly predictive in other examples, along with moderate weights for \"not cohabiting\" and \"held 2 jobs,\" reflecting potential instability. The household size of 3 is considered low risk because several similar examples resulted in no recidivism.",

using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 2 jobs with a household size of 3 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n
