The prediction has a confidence level of 75%. This analysis relies on the statistical patterns observed in the provided examples, where similar combinations of risk factors often led to recidivism within three years. However, it's crucial to remember that individual cases may not perfectly align with these patterns, and other unmeasured variables could also influence outcomes.",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting

their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
