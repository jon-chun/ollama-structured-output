While a larger family environment might be distracting, it doesn't inherently suggest a high risk factor without further context that indicates instability or lack of parental guidance.\n- **Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12** is rated as \"medium\" risk. Living with a parent may offer some stability, but the marital status unknown could imply a less structured environment than one with two parents present.\n\nBased on these weighted assessments and the pattern identified in the examples provided, the prediction for this case is **YES**, with a confidence level of 75%. This means that there is a higher likelihood of recidivism based on these risk factors.",
