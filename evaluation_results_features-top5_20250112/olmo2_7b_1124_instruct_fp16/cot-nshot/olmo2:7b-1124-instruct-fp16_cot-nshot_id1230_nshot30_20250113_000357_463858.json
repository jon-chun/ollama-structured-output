The reasoning for each risk factor's weight is as follows:\n\n- **Never married**: Typically associated with lower social support and potentially higher levels of isolation, which can influence one's propensity towards criminal behavior.\n- **Not cohabiting**: Indicates the individual may lack a stable living situation, which could contribute to challenges in forming healthy relationships and possibly increase stress or social isolation.\n- **Currently unemployed**: Unemployment is often linked with increased time on hand, decreased income, and social stigma, factors that can correlate with higher criminal activity rates.\n- **Household size of 4**: Larger households may increase competition for resources, potentially leading to increased stress and less individual attention from parents, which can indirectly influence behavior.\n- **Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12**: The lack of information about the parental marriage status suggests a potential instability in family life during a critical developmental period.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads to the prediction that this individual has a high likelihood of rearrest within the next three years, which is reflected in the \"YES\" prediction and a confidence level of 75%.",
