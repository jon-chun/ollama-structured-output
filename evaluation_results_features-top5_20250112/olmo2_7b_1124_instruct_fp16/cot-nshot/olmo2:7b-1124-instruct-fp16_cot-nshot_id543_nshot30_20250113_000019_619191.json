The impact of not cohabiting is less strong than being unmarried but still notable in the context.\n- **Held 3 Jobs**: Job instability has been noted as a medium-risk factor since it may reflect underlying issues that could potentially increase the likelihood of reoffending. However, the number of jobs held alone might not sufficiently predict recidivism and thus doesn't carry a high weight.\n- **Household Size of 4**: This factor is weighted as \"low\" because a larger family environment generally provides a supportive network which can help mitigate the risk of reoffending.\n\nThe prediction for this case is \"YES\", indicating a likelihood of rearrest within three years, with a confidence level of 65%. The combination of being never married and not cohabiting raises concern, though the individual's living situation within a household of four provides some offsetting support.",
