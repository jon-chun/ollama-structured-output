The reasoning follows from the provided examples where the presence of never being married and cohabiting, alongside potentially unstable family structures, suggests an increased likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism. Holding multiple jobs in itself carries a lower weight due to insufficient contextual information about job stability or instability without additional details.",
