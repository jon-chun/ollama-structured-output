The factor \"held 1 job\" is given a \"low\" weight because, while employment is generally beneficial, only having one job might not provide enough financial security or structure to counterbalance the other risk factors. A \"medium\" weight is assigned to \"household size\" due to its mixed potential; a large household can be both a source of support and a stressor, whereas living with both biological parents at age 12 is considered to have a \"low\" impact because it typically signifies a stable family environment.\n\nThe prediction is set as \"YES\" based on the aggregated risk factors, and the confidence is estimated to be 75%. This level of confidence suggests that while there are significant risk factors present, there is also a substantial degree of uncertainty inherent in predicting recidivism from these individual factors alone.",
