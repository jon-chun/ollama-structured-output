The reasoning behind each weight is based on the provided examples and typical criminological theories regarding risk factors for recidivism. For instance, never being married and not cohabiting often indicate lower social support and less societal integration, both of which are associated with higher risks of reoffending. Holding only one job might suggest a potential lack of stability, which could contribute to further criminal behavior. A smaller household size offers fewer familial influences that might deter criminal activity. Lastly, the unspecified marital status of the biological mother at age 12 could indicate an unstable family environment that may increase the risk of future offending. However, this prediction should be considered within the context of a broader assessment and not in isolation.",
