Gender is considered a moderate risk due to differing recidivism rates; never being married introduces a medium risk due to the potential lack of social support, but living with parents mitigates this somewhat. Not cohabiting is assessed as low risk, since it might imply less peer influence that could potentially lead to criminal behavior. Holding four jobs suggests a possible medium risk due to the instability associated with frequent job changes, which can affect rehabilitation efforts. Finally, living in a household of six people is assessed as medium risk, as it could offer both social interaction and competition for attention, which might affect the individual's ability to receive necessary support. The overall prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 65%, indicating that while there are moderate risks present, there are also mitigating factors that suggest a non-zero chance of lower recidivism.",
