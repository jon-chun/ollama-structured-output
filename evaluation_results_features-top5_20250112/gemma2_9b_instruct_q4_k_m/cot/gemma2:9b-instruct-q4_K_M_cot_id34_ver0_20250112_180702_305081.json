This is a well-documented factor.\n* **Marital Status - Never Married:** Unmarried individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates.  Marriage can provide stability and support systems that may deter re-offending.\n* **Cohabitation Status - Not Cohabiting:** While not living with a partner might indicate instability, it's generally considered less influential than marital status. \n* **Employment History - 1 job:** Limited work history is a significant risk factor. It suggests potential financial difficulties, lack of structure, and difficulty reintegrating into society.\n* **Household Size - 5:** A larger household can create financial strain and increase stress levels, potentially contributing to risk.\n\n**Overall Prediction:** The combination of these factors suggests a moderate to high risk of rearrest within three years. However, it's crucial to remember that this is just a prediction based on statistical trends. Individual circumstances and other unmeasured factors can significantly influence real-world outcomes. \n\n\nLet me know if you want to explore the impact of adding more risk factors or modifying existing ones.",
