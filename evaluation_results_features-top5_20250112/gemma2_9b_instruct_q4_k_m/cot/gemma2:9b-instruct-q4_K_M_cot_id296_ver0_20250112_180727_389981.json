It's crucial to remember that these are just relative weights and not definitive predictors of future behavior. A more comprehensive assessment would require:\n\n* **Age:**  A specific age is needed to better assess risk. Younger individuals generally have higher recidivism rates.\n* **Criminal History:** The nature and severity of prior offenses are essential factors in risk prediction.\n* **Mental Health:**  Mental health issues can significantly influence recidivism rates. \n* **Substance Abuse:**  A history of substance abuse is a strong risk factor.\n* **Social Support:**  Strong social support networks act as protective factors. \n\n\nLet me know if you want to add more information to the assessment!",
