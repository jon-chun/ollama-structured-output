Larger household size is considered a low-risk factor due to potential support networks.\n\n\nRemember that this is a simplified example. Real-world risk assessments consider many more factors, including offense type, criminal history, mental health, substance abuse issues, and more. They also use sophisticated statistical models and are conducted by trained professionals.",
