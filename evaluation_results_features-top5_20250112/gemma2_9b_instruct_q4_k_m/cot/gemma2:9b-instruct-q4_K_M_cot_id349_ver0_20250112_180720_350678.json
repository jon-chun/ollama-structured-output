This is a well-established risk factor.\n* **Marital Status (Medium):** Unmarried individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates compared to married individuals. This could be due to various factors like instability, lack of social support, etc.\n* **Employment Status (High):** Unemployment is a major risk factor for reoffending. It often leads to financial strain, social isolation, and limited opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\n* **Household Size (Low):** While larger households can present challenges, there's no strong direct link between household size and future criminal behavior. \n* **Living Situation at Age 12 (Low):** This factor has limited predictive value for adult criminal behavior.\n\n**Prediction and Confidence:**\n\nGiven the higher risk factors outweighing the lower ones, the prediction leans towards \"YES.\" However, the confidence level is moderate (60%) because this assessment relies on statistical trends rather than individual circumstances.  \n\n\nRemember: Risk assessments are just one tool in the criminal justice system and should be used with caution and alongside other relevant information.",
