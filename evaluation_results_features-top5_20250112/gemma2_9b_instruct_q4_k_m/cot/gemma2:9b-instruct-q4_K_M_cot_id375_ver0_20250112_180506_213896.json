This is assigned a \"medium\" weight due to its prevalence in statistical data.\n* **Marital Status (Never Married, Cohabiting):** Unstable relationships or lack of strong marital bonds can contribute to risk factors like financial stress and social isolation. This receives a \"medium\" weight. \n* **Employment History (3 Jobs):**  While not ideal, having held multiple jobs suggests some level of work ethic and stability. This is considered a mildly positive factor and assigned \"low\" weight.\n* **Household Size (2):** The size of the household doesn't have a strong correlation with recidivism rates in general. It receives a \"low\" weight.\n* **Living Situation (with Biological Mother):**  Family support can be a protective factor against reoffending. This is given a \"low\" weight as it's not universally applicable.\n* **Marital Status at Age 12 (unknown):** This data point is too limited to draw any meaningful conclusions about future risk. It receives a \"low\" weight.\n\n\n**Prediction and Confidence:**\n\nThe overall prediction is \"NO\"  based on the weighted factors. However, the confidence level is only 60%.  This indicates that while the individual presents relatively low risk based on these factors, there are still some uncertainties.  A more comprehensive assessment would involve additional information like:\n\n* Criminal history\n* Offense type\n* Substance abuse issues\n* Mental health status\n* Level of remorse and willingness to change\n\n\nRemember, criminal risk assessment is complex and no single factor or model can perfectly predict future behavior. \n",
