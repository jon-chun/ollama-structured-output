While there are some medium-weight risk factors, the higher weight given to the potentially unstable upbringing environment is balanced by the lower weight assigned to other factors like gender and cohabitation.  \n\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65% because the data provided is limited. A more comprehensive assessment with additional information about employment history, criminal history (if any), and support systems would lead to a more accurate prediction.",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting

their other adults, biological parent status unknown, not group quarters at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\",
