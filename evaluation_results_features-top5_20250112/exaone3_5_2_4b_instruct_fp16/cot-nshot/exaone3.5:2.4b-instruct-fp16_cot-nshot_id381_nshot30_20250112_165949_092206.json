First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 6 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 4 jobs with a household size of 4 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never

using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a male who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 1 jobs with a household size of 5 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n
