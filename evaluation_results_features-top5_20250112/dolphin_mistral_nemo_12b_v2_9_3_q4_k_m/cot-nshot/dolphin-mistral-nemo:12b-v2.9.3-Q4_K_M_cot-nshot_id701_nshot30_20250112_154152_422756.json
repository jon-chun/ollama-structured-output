    "raw_message_text": "Analyzing the provided risk factors, we can see several recurring themes that are associated with an increased likelihood of recidivism:\n\n- Never married: This factor is present in all examples. The stability brought by a committed relationship may help to reduce criminal behavior.\n- Not cohabiting: Living alone or without a partner also appears across all cases. This could suggest that individuals who live alone may have fewer social connections and support systems, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHowever, there are other factors that seem to vary:\n\n- Number of jobs held: This factor varies from 1 job (Examples #6, #9, #12) to 5 jobs (Example #21). While employment can be a protective factor against crime because it provides structure and income, the number of jobs one has may not directly correlate with recidivism.\n- Household size: This ranges from 2 people in Example #9 to 7 people in Examples #26 & #29. A larger household might indicate more support or stability which could be protective against crime.\n\nFor our final case, the person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting and has held 4 jobs with a household size of 5 and lived with their both biological parents at age 12. Given that she's never been married, not living with a partner, and holding multiple jobs (which could indicate instability), we can assign medium risk levels to these factors.\n\nIn the light of all this information:\n\n{\n   \"risk_factors\": [\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\",\"She is never-married\"),\n     (\"cohabiting_status\", \"medium\",\"She does not live with a partner\"),\n     (\"number_of_jobs_held\", \"high\",\"She holds 4 jobs\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 80\n}",
