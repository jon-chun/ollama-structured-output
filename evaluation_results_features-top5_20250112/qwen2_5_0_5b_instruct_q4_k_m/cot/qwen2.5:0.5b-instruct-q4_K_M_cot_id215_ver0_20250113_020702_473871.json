The factors in question are:\n\n1. \"Female gender\" - This factor indicates that the risk factor for rearrest recidivism is female.\n2. \"Never married or cohabiting\" - This factor suggests that the person may be at higher risk due to their current lifestyle and relationship status.\n3. \"Has held 3 jobs with a household size of 5\" - This factor provides specific details about the number of jobs and household size, which can influence the likelihood of rearrest recidivism.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall assessment would indicate moderate risk, likely due to the combination of female gender, non-marriage/cohabitation, and having multiple jobs. However, it's important to note that this is a rough estimate based on general guidelines in criminal justice risk assessments. A more detailed analysis or expert opinion would be needed for an accurate prediction.",
