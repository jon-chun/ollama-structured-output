This indicates a high level of personal responsibility and potential for reoffending, given his lack of marriage history.\n- The fact that he has not cohabited or lived with both biological parents at age 12 suggests he may have some social support but does not guarantee any future criminal activity. His household size of 4 in a single-parent family is also noted.\n\nThe combined risk factors suggest a medium level of relative weight to be assigned. However, the specific context and details provided do not provide sufficient evidence for a definitive prediction beyond the low-weight category. Therefore, we assign the highest possible weight (high), indicating that there might be some underlying characteristics or vulnerabilities not yet fully assessed.",
