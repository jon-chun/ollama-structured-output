    "raw_message_text": "Based on the analysis of the provided examples, we can assign weights to each risk factor for the new case:\n\n- **Never married**: The majority of cases are never married, and both recidivists and non-recidivists fall into this category. This suggests that being never married is not a significant predictor. Therefore, the weight can be considered **low**.\n  \n- **Not cohabiting**: Similar to marital status, cohabitation status does not show a clear pattern of contributing to recidivism. Thus, it can be considered **low** as well.\n  \n- **Held 1 job**: Most individuals in the dataset have held 1 job, with both recidivists and non-recidivists present. Job stability may not be strongly correlated with recidivism risk. Hence, this factor is also **low**.\n  \n- **Household size of 4**: There is a mix of recidivists and non-recidivists across different household sizes. This suggests that household size might not be a strong predictor. Thus, it can be considered **low**.\n  \n- **Lived with adoptive parents at age 12**: This factor does not appear in the provided examples, making it difficult to assign a weight. However, considering that stability in parenting may positively influence outcomes, this could potentially be **low**.\n\nGiven these considerations, and assuming each factor is independent and equally weighted:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Never married\", \"low\", \"Being never married does not show a clear pattern of contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Not cohabiting\", \"low\", \"Cohabitation status does not show a clear pattern of contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job\", \"low\", \"Job stability might not be strongly correlated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 4\", \"low\", \"Household size does not appear to be a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"Lived with adoptive parents at age 12\", \"low\", \"Stability in parenting may positively influence outcomes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
