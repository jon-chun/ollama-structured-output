using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a male who is married, spouse present and has held 2 jobs with a household size of 6.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format,
