This is a high-risk factor as it indicates that the person may lack financial stability and resources to support themselves, which could lead to engaging in criminal activity to obtain money or other necessities.\n* Factor 2: Household size of 4 and living with both biological parents at age 12. This is a low-risk factor as it indicates that the person has had stable family relationships in the past and may have a support system to turn to if needed.\n* Factor 3: Being a male who is never married, not cohabiting. This is a medium-risk factor as it suggests that the person may lack social connections and emotional support, which could make them more vulnerable to engage in criminal activity or be drawn into risky behaviors.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 70. This means that there is a moderate likelihood that the person will not be rearrested within the next three years.",
