    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism, we need to evaluate each factor based on empirical research in criminal justice. Here\u2019s a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Gender (Female)**: Research generally indicates that females have lower rates of recidivism compared to males.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Statistically, women are less likely to be rearrested than men.\n\n2. **Marital Status (Never Married, Cohabiting)**: Being never married can sometimes increase risk, but cohabitation may provide stability similar to marriage.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Cohabitation provides some social support, which can mitigate the risks associated with being never married.\n\n3. **Employment History (Held 3 Jobs)**: Holding multiple jobs indicates a degree of instability in employment but also shows willingness and ability to work.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Frequent job changes might indicate instability, yet maintaining employment is positive.\n\n4. **Household Size (6 members)**: Larger households can provide support but may also strain resources.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: A large household can offer social support but may also lead to financial stress.\n\n5. **Parental Influence (Lived with both biological parents at age 12)**: Positive parental influence during formative years is generally protective against recidivism.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Living with both biological parents often provides a stable upbringing, reducing risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's predict the likelihood of rearrest:\n\n- The positive factors (female gender and living with both parents at age 12) suggest lower risk.\n- The neutral to slightly negative factors (never married but cohabiting, employment history, and large household size) balance out some risks.\n\nOverall, these factors collectively suggest a **low** probability of recidivism within three years. However, the presence of medium-risk factors means we cannot be entirely confident in predicting no rearrest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Statistically, women are less likely to be rearrested than men.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Cohabitation provides some social support, mitigating risks associated with being never married.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes might indicate instability, yet maintaining employment is positive.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"A large household can offer social support but may also lead to financial stress.\"),\n    (\"parental_influence\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents often provides a stable upbringing, reducing risk factors for criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
