    "raw_message_text": "To assess the risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism, we need to evaluate each factor based on available research and data trends in criminal justice. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Gender (Female)**: \n   - Women generally have lower recidivism rates compared to men.\n   - **Weight**: Low\n   - **Reasoning**: Statistical evidence shows females are less likely to be rearrested than males.\n\n2. **Marital Status (Never Married, Cohabiting)**:\n   - Being cohabiting can offer some stability similar to marriage, which is often associated with lower recidivism.\n   - Never being married may imply a lack of certain social bonds that reduce recidivism risk.\n   - **Weight**: Medium\n   - **Reasoning**: Cohabitation provides some protective effect, but never having been married might slightly increase risk.\n\n3. **Employment (1 Job)**:\n   - Stable employment is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n   - Having held only one job could indicate either stability or lack of diverse work experience.\n   - **Weight**: Medium\n   - **Reasoning**: Employment reduces risk, but the limited number of jobs suggests potential instability.\n\n4. **Household Size (2)**:\n   - A smaller household size might imply fewer social supports or resources.\n   - **Weight**: Low\n   - **Reasoning**: Household size alone is not a strong predictor unless it significantly affects stability or support.\n\n5. **Living with Biological Mother**:\n   - Living with family can provide support and supervision, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\n   - **Weight**: Low\n   - **Reasoning**: Family support generally lowers risk, but the impact varies based on family dynamics.\n\n6. **Marital Status Unknown at Age 12**:\n   - Early life instability or lack of information could indicate potential social challenges.\n   - **Weight**: Medium\n   - **Reasoning**: Uncertainty about early childhood environment might correlate with later instability.\n\nBased on these assessments, the overall prediction leans towards a lower risk of recidivism due to several protective factors (e.g., gender, cohabitation, family support). However, some uncertainties and potential risks are present.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Cohabiting offers some stability, but never being married might slightly increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Stable employment reduces risk, but limited job history suggests potential instability.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Household size alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_with_biological_mother\", \"low\", \"Family support generally lowers risk, though impact varies.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_unknown_at_age_12\", \"medium\", \"Uncertainty about early childhood environment might correlate with later instability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
