Being never married or cohabiting does not inherently indicate a high risk, although it can be associated with instability in some contexts.\n\n2. **Job Stability:** Holding four jobs could suggest job instability, which might contribute to financial stress and potential risk factors. However, this alone is not determinative of high risk without additional context on the reasons for job changes.\n\n3. **Household Size and Family Environment:** Living in a household size of 3 with a biological mother can provide a supportive family environment, potentially mitigating some risks associated with instability or lack of support.\n\n4. **Unknown Marital Status at Age 12:** This is not typically a significant factor in risk assessment for adulthood criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could suggest potential challenges (such as job stability), the presence of supportive family elements and gender considerations lean towards a lower risk prediction. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty based on these typical associations but acknowledges variability in individual circumstances.",
