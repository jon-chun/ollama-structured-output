Being never married may also contribute to a lack of social support structures that can mitigate risk.\n\n- **Employment History:** Holding only one job could indicate instability in employment, which is often associated with higher risk for re-offending.\n\n- **Household Size and Family Structure:** A household size of 4 might suggest potential socioeconomic stress. However, having both biological parents present at age 12 could be a mitigating factor, suggesting some positive family influence during formative years.\n\nGiven these factors, the assessment leans towards a higher risk prediction with moderate confidence due to the mixed nature of the indicators (some protective and some risk-enhancing).",
