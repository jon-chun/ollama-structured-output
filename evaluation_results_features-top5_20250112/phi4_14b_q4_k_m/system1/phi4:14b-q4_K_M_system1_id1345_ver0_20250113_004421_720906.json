Frequent job changes might be concerning in other contexts, but holding multiple jobs does not inherently indicate high risk.\n- **Household Size and Family Structure:** Living with biological parents until age 12 generally suggests a stable early family environment. The unknown marital status at age 12 is neutral without further context.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential areas of concern (e.g., never married, not cohabiting), the factors present do not collectively indicate a high risk for criminal behavior or recidivism based on typical statistical models and judicial knowledge. The confidence level reflects this analysis but acknowledges that additional context could alter the assessment.",
