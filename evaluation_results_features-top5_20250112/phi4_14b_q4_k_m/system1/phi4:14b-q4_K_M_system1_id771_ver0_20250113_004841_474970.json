Being male is statistically linked to a higher incidence in many crime statistics. The fact that he is never married and cohabiting might suggest instability in personal relationships, which can be a factor. Holding only one job could indicate economic instability or lack of commitment, contributing to risk. A household size of 2 with the biological mother as his primary caregiver at an early age may also point towards potential familial dynamics affecting behavior. However, there are mitigating circumstances and unknowns (like marital status at age 12) that temper a higher level of confidence in this assessment. Thus, while these factors collectively suggest a higher risk, they do not guarantee it. Hence, the prediction is \"YES\" with a moderate confidence of 75%.",
