However, this factor alone does not significantly mitigate other risk factors.\n\n- **Marital Status and Cohabitation**: Being never married and not cohabiting can be associated with higher risk due to lack of social support systems that might otherwise provide stability and accountability.\n\n- **Employment Status**: Unemployment is a significant risk factor as it may contribute to financial stress, lack of routine, and potential engagement in illegal activities for economic reasons.\n\n- **Household Size**: A larger household size (4) could indicate either strong family ties or increased stress due to resource constraints. The impact varies based on the dynamics within the household.\n\n- **Living Arrangements at Age 12**: Living with a biological mother might suggest familial support, but if the marital status of parents was unknown at age 12, it may reflect instability during formative years, potentially contributing to higher risk.\n\nGiven these factors, there are several elements that contribute to an elevated risk profile. However, without additional context or data points (such as criminal history, education level, mental health status), the confidence in this prediction is moderate at 75%.",
