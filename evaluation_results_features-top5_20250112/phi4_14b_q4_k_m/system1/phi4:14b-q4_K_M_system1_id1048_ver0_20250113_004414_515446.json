Males, particularly those who are never married and not cohabiting, often show a statistically increased likelihood of certain types of negative outcomes compared to their peers in more stable living situations. Unemployment is another significant risk factor as it may contribute to financial stress and instability, which can exacerbate other issues. A larger household size of 4 could imply potential resource strain or family dynamics that might not be conducive to positive outcomes. The lack of information about marital status at age 12 adds uncertainty but historically stable early life factors (such as knowing one's marital status) can sometimes correlate with more favorable developmental trajectories.\n\nHowever, it is important to note the confidence level of 75, which reflects a moderate degree of certainty in this assessment given the limited data and the complexity of human behavior. Other unmeasured variables could significantly influence outcomes, so while these factors collectively suggest higher risk, they are not determinative on their own.",
