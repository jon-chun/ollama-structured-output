Being married and having a spouse present typically indicates social support, which can mitigate risk. Holding two jobs suggests some level of employment stability, though not exceptional. A household size of three is common and does not inherently indicate high or low risk.\n\nLiving with their biological mother could suggest familial support, although this factor alone does not strongly influence risk assessment without additional context. The unknown marital status at age 12 is a neutral factor as it lacks relevance to adult behavior unless tied to other negative experiences.\n\nOverall, these factors do not collectively indicate a high-risk profile. However, the confidence level is set at 75 due to the lack of more specific or negative indicators that might increase risk.",
