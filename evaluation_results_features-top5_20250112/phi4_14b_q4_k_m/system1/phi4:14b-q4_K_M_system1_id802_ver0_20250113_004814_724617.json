It doesn't suggest instability or criminal behavior.\n\n- **Household Size & Family Environment:** Living with both biological parents at age 12 is typically associated with stable family environments, which can reduce risk factors related to delinquency or criminal activity later in life.\n\nOverall, without additional negative indicators such as a history of criminal behavior, substance abuse, or other socio-economic stressors, the presented risk factors do not strongly suggest high risk. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty given the limited data.",
