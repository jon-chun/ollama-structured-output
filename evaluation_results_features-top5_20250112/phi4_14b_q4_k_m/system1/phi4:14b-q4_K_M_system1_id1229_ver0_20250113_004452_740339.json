However, having multiple jobs doesn't automatically equate to high risk, especially if the changes were for positive reasons like career advancement or relocation.\n\n4. **Household Size**: A household size of five is relatively large and can imply financial stress or resource sharing issues, but it does not directly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism without other contributing factors.\n\nOverall, these factors alone do not strongly indicate a high risk without additional context such as criminal history, substance abuse, or psychological assessments. Therefore, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk, with moderate confidence due to the lack of more definitive negative indicators.",
