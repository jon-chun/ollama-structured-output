Being married, with a spouse present, is often associated with reduced risk due to social support.\n\n2. **Employment Stability**: Holding two jobs suggests some level of employment stability, which can be a mitigating factor against high-risk behavior.\n\n3. **Household Size and Family Structure**: A household size of five might imply a larger family network, potentially offering more support but not necessarily indicating risk without additional context.\n\n4. **Marital Status Unknown at Age 12**: This is less commonly used as a predictive factor for risk in adulthood unless it indicates broader instability or neglect during formative years.\n\nOverall, these factors do not strongly indicate high risk, hence the prediction \"NO\" with moderate confidence of 75, acknowledging that other unmentioned factors could influence risk.",
