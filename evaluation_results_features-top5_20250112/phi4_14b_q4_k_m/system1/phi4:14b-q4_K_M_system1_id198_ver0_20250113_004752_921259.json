This factor might mitigate some risks associated with other factors but does not eliminate them entirely.\n\nOverall, while certain individual factors could suggest higher risk, the presence of a supportive family environment suggests a more nuanced picture. The prediction leans towards \"YES\" due to the cumulative effect of these factors, but with moderate confidence (65) because not all indicators strongly point towards high risk without additional context or information.",
