Having lived with their biological dad but having an unknown marital status at age 12 might imply some familial instability during formative years.\n\n5. **Overall Context:** The combination of these factors aligns with risk indicators that suggest potential for higher risk, though this is not deterministic. Confidence is set at 75 due to the presence of multiple moderate risk factors without more specific or severe indicators (e.g., criminal history).",
