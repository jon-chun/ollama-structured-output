While not extensive work history, it doesn't indicate high risk.\n\n- **Household Size:** A household size of 6 might suggest potential economic pressure but also indicates a larger family network which can provide support.\n\n- **Family Environment at Age 12:** Living with both biological parents during childhood is typically associated with positive developmental outcomes and lower risk for criminal behavior later in life.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall assessment leans towards low risk. However, without more comprehensive data, there's some uncertainty, hence a confidence level of 75%.",
