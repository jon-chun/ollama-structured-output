Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n1. **Gender and Marital Status:** Research often shows that females have lower recidivism rates compared to males. Being married with a spouse present is generally considered a stabilizing factor.\n\n2. **Employment Stability:** Holding 1 job might suggest limited work experience, but it does not necessarily indicate instability or high risk without additional context such as duration and reasons for leaving previous jobs.\n\n3. **Household Size and Family Environment:** A household size of 3 with the presence of a biological mother can provide a supportive environment, which is generally associated with lower risk.\n\n4. **Marital Status at Age 12:** Unknown marital status at age 12 does not directly contribute to current risk assessment without additional context on family dynamics or stability during formative years.\n\nOverall, while some factors could suggest potential vulnerabilities (e.g., limited job history), the presence of stabilizing factors like being married and having a supportive household environment leads to a prediction of \"NO\" for high risk with moderate confidence.",
