While marital status can sometimes correlate with stability, it is not a definitive predictor of criminal risk.\n\n3. **Employment History**: Holding two jobs could suggest instability, but it might also reflect adaptability or career exploration, which are not necessarily negative indicators.\n\n4. **Household Size and Parental Influence at Age 12**: Living in a household size of four with both biological parents during childhood is often associated with a stable upbringing, which typically correlates with lower risk.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall assessment leans towards a low-risk prediction. However, the confidence level is set at 75 due to the limited scope of data and potential for other unconsidered variables that could influence risk.",
