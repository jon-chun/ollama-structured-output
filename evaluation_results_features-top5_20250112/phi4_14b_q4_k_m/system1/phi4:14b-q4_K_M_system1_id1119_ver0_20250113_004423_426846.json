Being a male, never married, not cohabiting, and unemployed are factors often associated with higher risk due to potential social and economic instability. Additionally, having a household size of four without employment can contribute to financial strain. However, these factors alone do not guarantee high risk, hence the confidence is set at 75 rather than closer to 100, acknowledging other unconsidered variables that could influence risk level.",
