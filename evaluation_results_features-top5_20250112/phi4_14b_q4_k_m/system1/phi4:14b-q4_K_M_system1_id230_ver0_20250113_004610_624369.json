Never being married can be linked to various social factors that might increase risk.\n\n2. **Cohabitation:** Not cohabiting may suggest instability or lack of supportive relationships, which are protective factors against recidivism and criminal activity.\n\n3. **Employment History:** Holding only one job could indicate potential issues with employment stability or commitment, both of which can be risk factors for higher recidivism rates in certain contexts.\n\n4. **Household Size:** A household size of 5 at a young age might suggest overcrowding, which can lead to stress and behavioral problems that are sometimes linked to higher risk.\n\n5. **Family Structure:** Living with both biological parents at age 12 is typically considered a protective factor; however, it does not negate the other factors present.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\nThe confidence level of 75 reflects the presence of multiple moderate risk factors but acknowledges that these do not constitute an overwhelming or definitive prediction without additional context.",
