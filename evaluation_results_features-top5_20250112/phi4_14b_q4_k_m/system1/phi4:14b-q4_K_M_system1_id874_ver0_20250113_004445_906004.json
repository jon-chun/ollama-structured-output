Without further context on the nature of job changes (voluntary vs involuntary), this factor alone doesn't strongly indicate high risk.\n\n3. **Household Size & Family Structure:** A household size of 4 is typical, and having lived with both biological parents at age 12 can suggest a stable early environment, which generally lowers risk factors related to criminal behavior.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n- The analysis leads to a \"NO\" prediction for high risk due to the lack of clear indicators like criminal history or severe instability.\n- Confidence is set at 75 because while there are some potential concerns (e.g., job changes), the overall profile lacks strong negative predictors. Further information would be needed for higher confidence.",
