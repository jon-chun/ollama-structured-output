Being never married and not cohabiting can also be associated with a lack of social support, which might increase the risk.\n\n2. **Employment Status:** Unemployment is a significant factor as it may lead to financial strain and increased stress, potentially contributing to higher risks of negative behaviors.\n\n3. **Household Size:** A household size of 4 could imply limited resources per individual, especially if unemployed, increasing stress within the family unit.\n\n4. **Living Situation:** Living with biological mother but unknown marital status at age 12 may suggest possible instability or lack of a two-parent structure during formative years, which some studies associate with higher risks for certain negative outcomes.\n\n5. **Confidence Level:** While these factors collectively suggest a higher risk, individual circumstances and other mitigating factors are not accounted for in this assessment, hence the confidence is set at 85 rather than 100.",
