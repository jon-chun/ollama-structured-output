However, being never married and not cohabiting could indicate instability or lack of social support structures.\n\n2. **Employment History:** Holding multiple jobs can sometimes suggest instability in employment, which might contribute to financial stress or dissatisfaction, potentially increasing risk.\n\n3. **Household Size and Family Dynamics:** A household size of 5 indicates a larger family dynamic, which may either provide more support or create additional stressors depending on the environment. Living with her biological mother could imply familial support but also potential conflict if the relationship is strained.\n\n4. **Marital Status at Age 12:** The unknown marital status of parents at age 12 might suggest early exposure to unstable family environments, which can be a risk factor for future behavioral issues.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest some level of instability and stressors that could contribute to higher risk behavior, though the presence of familial support (biological mother) mitigates this somewhat. Therefore, while there are indicators of potential high risk, they do not conclusively point to it, leading to a moderate confidence level in predicting \"YES\" for high risk.",
