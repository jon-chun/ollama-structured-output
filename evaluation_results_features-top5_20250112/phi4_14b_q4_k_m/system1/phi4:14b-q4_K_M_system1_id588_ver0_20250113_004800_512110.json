Living with biological parents until an unknown age at marriage might indicate dependency issues or lack of independence.\n\n4. **Unknown Marital Status at Age 12:** This factor is less directly relevant but could imply a lack of stable family structure during formative years, potentially contributing to risk.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\n- The prediction is \"YES\" for high risk due to the combination of these factors.\n- A confidence level of 75 is assigned because while these factors are indicative of higher risk, they do not guarantee criminal behavior and other mitigating circumstances could exist.",
