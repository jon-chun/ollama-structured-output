This uncertainty might suggest a less supportive environment during formative years.\n\n5. **Living Situation at Age 12**: Not living in group quarters at age 12 implies that the person was not in institutional care, which could be positive; however, without more context on the home environment, it doesn't strongly mitigate other risk factors.\n\n**Confidence Level**: The confidence is set at 75 due to the presence of multiple risk factors that align with known predictors of higher criminal justice risks. However, individual circumstances and additional contextual information are not provided, which could influence the overall assessment.",
