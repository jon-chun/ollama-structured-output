Being never married can also correlate with higher risk, although cohabitation might mitigate some of these risks.\n\n2. **Employment History**: Holding multiple jobs may indicate instability or lack of long-term commitment, which could be seen as a potential risk factor.\n\n3. **Household Size and Living Situation**: A household size of 4 is not inherently risky, but living with the biological mother suggests possible family dynamics that might contribute to risk, especially if there were any issues at home.\n\n4. **Marital Status Unknown at Age 12**: This could indicate a lack of stable family structure during formative years, which can be associated with higher risk.\n\nOverall, these factors combined suggest a moderate to high risk, hence the prediction \"YES\" with a confidence level of 75%. The confidence is not higher due to some mitigating factors like cohabitation and potential positive influences from living with a biological parent.",
