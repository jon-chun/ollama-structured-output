Being male is a demographic factor often linked with higher crime rates. The instability in employment (holding four jobs) and living arrangements (cohabiting, large household size of five, and residing with biological mother) may indicate socioeconomic challenges or lack of stable support systems, both of which can contribute to increased risk. Additionally, unknown marital status at age 12 suggests a lack of structured family environment during formative years. These factors collectively suggest a moderate to high risk level, though the confidence is not absolute due to potential mitigating circumstances not accounted for in this data.",
