Additionally, living with a biological mother without clear information about marital status at age 12 could suggest possible familial instability during formative years.\n\nThese factors collectively contribute to an elevated risk assessment. However, the confidence level is set at 75 due to variability in individual circumstances and the absence of specific contextual details such as criminal history or behavioral assessments.",
