This factor contributes to a higher risk assessment.\n\n- **Marital Status and Cohabitation:** Being never married and not cohabiting can indicate social isolation or lack of stable adult relationships, which may correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\n- **Employment History:** Holding only one job suggests potential instability in employment, which is often associated with economic stressors that could contribute to higher risk behavior.\n\n- **Household Size:** A larger household size (6) might suggest a challenging environment if resources are limited or family dynamics are strained. However, it can also indicate strong familial support, which complicates the assessment but doesn't negate potential risks from other factors.\n\n- **Family Structure at Age 12:** Living with a biological mother is generally seen as positive unless there were negative circumstances (which aren't specified). The unknown marital status of the mother could imply single-parent household challenges, often linked to higher risk environments if additional stressors are present.\n\nOverall, while some factors like living with a biological parent can be protective, the combination of gender, marital and cohabitation status, employment history, and potential economic stress from a large household size contribute to a high-risk assessment. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the lack of specific negative indicators within the family structure but considering the cumulative effect of other risk factors.",
