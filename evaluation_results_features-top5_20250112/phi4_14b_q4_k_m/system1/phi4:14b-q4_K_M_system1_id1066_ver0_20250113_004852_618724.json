Being unemployed and never married can correlate with economic instability and lack of social support, both of which are considered potential risk factors. Additionally, living with a household size of three might imply limited resources per individual, especially if the primary caregiver has financial challenges. The historical context of an unknown marital status at age 12 suggests possible early familial instability or disruption, which can be linked to higher risk behaviors later in life. However, these assessments are probabilistic and not deterministic; therefore, while there is a high confidence level, it is not absolute.",
