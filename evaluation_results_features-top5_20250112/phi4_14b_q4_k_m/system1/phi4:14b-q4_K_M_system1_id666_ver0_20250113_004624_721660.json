Being male, never married, not cohabiting, and unemployed are variables often linked to increased risk profiles. Additionally, having a larger household size without economic contribution could contribute to stressors potentially related to criminal behavior. The historical context of living with both biological parents at age 12 may have mixed implications but does not significantly mitigate the other identified risks in this scenario. However, it is important to note that these factors alone do not determine outcomes definitively; thus, confidence is set at a moderate level.",
