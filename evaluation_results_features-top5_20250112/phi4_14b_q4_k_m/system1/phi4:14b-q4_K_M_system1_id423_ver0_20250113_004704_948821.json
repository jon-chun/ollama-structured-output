Being male is sometimes associated with higher risks in certain contexts, but not being married or cohabiting alone does not significantly elevate risk without other indicators of instability. Holding two jobs may suggest employment stability rather than instability, and a household size of four doesn't inherently indicate high risk. The presence of biological parents at age 12 can be positive for developmental support, reducing the potential risk associated with adverse childhood experiences. Without additional negative factors such as criminal history or substance abuse, these factors do not strongly predict high risk. Thus, the confidence level is moderate, reflecting some uncertainty due to limited information.",
