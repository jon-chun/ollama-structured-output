However, these are not definitive indicators on their own.\n\n- **Employment Stability:** Holding one job might indicate some level of instability or limited work history, which could be a concern, but it is not necessarily indicative of high risk without additional context.\n\n- **Household Size and Family Structure:** Living in a household of three with biological parents present at age 12 suggests a stable family environment during formative years. Positive parental presence can mitigate some risks associated with other factors.\n\nGiven the mixed nature of these factors, they do not collectively indicate a high risk without additional negative indicators such as criminal history or substance abuse. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the moderate certainty based on typical patterns observed in risk assessments.",
