Living with other adults without a clear biological parent status might suggest less parental supervision or guidance during formative years.\n- **Group Quarters at Age 12:** Not living in group quarters (e.g., institutions) at age 12 generally implies normal upbringing but, combined with other risk factors, it may not mitigate the overall risk.\n\nThese factors collectively contribute to a higher perceived risk, though individual circumstances can vary. The confidence level reflects the general statistical trends associated with these factors.",
