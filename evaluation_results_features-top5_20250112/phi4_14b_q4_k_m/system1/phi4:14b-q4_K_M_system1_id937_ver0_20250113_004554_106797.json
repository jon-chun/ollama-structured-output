This factor typically indicates a lower risk.\n\n- **Marital Status and Household**: Being married with spouse present is often associated with stability, which can reduce risk. A household size of 4 suggests some level of social support.\n\n- **Employment History**: Having held one job could indicate limited employment experience, but it does not necessarily imply high risk without additional negative factors.\n\n- **Family Environment**: Living with a biological mother and having an unknown marital status at age 12 may raise concerns about early childhood stability. However, these factors alone are insufficient to categorize as high risk without more context or negative indicators.\n\nGiven the limited negative indicators present in this scenario, the overall assessment leans towards \"NO\" for high risk, but with moderate confidence due to some potential areas of concern.",
