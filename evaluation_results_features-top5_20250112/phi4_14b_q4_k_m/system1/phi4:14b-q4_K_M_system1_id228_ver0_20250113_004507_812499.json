Being male is a known factor associated with higher recidivism rates, although it's not definitive on its own. The fact that the person has held multiple jobs could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is often correlated with higher risk. Additionally, living alone and having lived with their biological mother without cohabitation information might suggest a lack of social support structures, contributing to increased risk.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these factors are not determinative on their own but rather contribute to an overall assessment when considered in aggregate. The confidence level reflects the relative strength of this pattern based on existing research while acknowledging variability and other potential mitigating or exacerbating factors not included in the data provided.",
