Being never married and not cohabiting does not inherently increase risk.\n\n2. **Employment History:** Holding one job is relatively typical, especially if employment stability has been maintained since then.\n\n3. **Household Size:** A household size of 4 suggests a potentially supportive family environment, which can be protective against criminal behavior.\n\n4. **Family Structure at Age 12:** Living with both biological parents during childhood is often associated with positive outcomes and lower risk factors for delinquency.\n\nOverall, these factors do not strongly correlate with high-risk indicators in the context of criminal justice risk assessment. The confidence level reflects a moderate degree of certainty based on available data and typical patterns observed in risk assessments.",
