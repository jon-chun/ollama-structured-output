Being male is often associated with higher rates of criminal behavior compared to females. A history of being never married and cohabiting can sometimes correlate with instability, which may increase risk in certain contexts. Holding only one job could suggest employment instability or lack of work experience, both of which are potential risk factors.\n\nA household size of 6 might imply resource constraints or family dynamics that could contribute to stress or behavioral issues. Living with a biological mother is generally seen as positive; however, the marital status being unknown at age 12 might suggest family instability during formative years, potentially contributing to higher risk behaviors.\n\nThese factors collectively are considered in criminological assessments and can indicate a higher likelihood of future risky behavior, although individual circumstances and additional context could significantly alter this assessment. The confidence level is set at 75, reflecting the combination of these factors but acknowledging variability based on further personal history or contextual details not provided here.",
