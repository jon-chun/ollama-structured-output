This factor increases the risk level.\n\n- **Marital Status and Cohabitation:** Being never married yet cohabiting may suggest a lack of stable long-term commitments, which can correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\n- **Employment History:** Holding only one job could indicate instability or challenges in maintaining employment, potentially reflecting broader issues that could elevate risk.\n\n- **Household Size:** A household size of five might imply potential economic stressors, especially if there are limited resources to support a larger family. This can increase the risk level.\n\n- **Living Arrangements with Biological Mother at Age 12:** The influence and stability provided by living arrangements during formative years can impact long-term behavior patterns. Marital status unknown at age 12 could suggest instability or stress in early life, which is often correlated with higher risk behaviors later on.\n\nThese factors collectively contribute to a prediction of high risk, though the confidence level reflects some uncertainty due to individual variability and the complex interplay of these factors.",
