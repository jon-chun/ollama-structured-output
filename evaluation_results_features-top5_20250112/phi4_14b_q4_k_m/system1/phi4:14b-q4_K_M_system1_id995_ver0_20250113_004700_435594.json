Being male is generally associated with higher risk in many studies related to criminal behavior. Never being married and having a history of holding multiple jobs could indicate instability or lack of strong social ties, which are known protective factors against recidivism. Cohabiting without marriage might suggest less formal commitment, contributing slightly to perceived risk. A household size of three may not directly increase risk unless there are other stressors or negative dynamics involved. The unknown marital status at age 12 could imply early instability in the home environment. Collectively, these factors suggest a moderate to high level of risk, leading to a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level of 70%, reflecting some uncertainty due to the lack of more specific data on individual behavior or other protective factors that might mitigate risk.",
