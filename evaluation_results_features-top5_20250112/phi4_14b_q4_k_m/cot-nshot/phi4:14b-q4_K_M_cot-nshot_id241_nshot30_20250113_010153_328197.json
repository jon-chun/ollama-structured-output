Thus, being female is assigned a low weight.\n\n2. **Marital Status**: Never married status is more frequently associated with 'YES' outcomes in males but less so for females, suggesting it has a moderate impact overall.\n\n3. **Cohabitation Status**: Cohabiting does not significantly correlate with rearrest outcomes as most positive cases are non-cohabitating. Therefore, its weight is low.\n\n4. **Employment History**: More jobs held correlates more strongly with 'YES' outcomes in males. For females, holding a single job does not show strong correlation with recidivism; hence medium weight for employment history.\n\n5. **Household Size**: No clear pattern indicates household size as a predictor. It varies across both genders and outcomes, leading to a low weight assignment.\n\n6. **Family Composition at Age 12**: Lived with both biological parents appears protective against rearrest for females, indicated by the majority 'NO' outcomes in these cases, suggesting a medium influence on the outcome.\n\nGiven the profile of this case\u2014a female who is never married, not cohabiting, held one job, lived with both biological parents at age 12\u2014the factors collectively suggest a lower likelihood of recidivism. Thus, the prediction for rearrest recidivism is \"NO\" with moderate confidence.",
