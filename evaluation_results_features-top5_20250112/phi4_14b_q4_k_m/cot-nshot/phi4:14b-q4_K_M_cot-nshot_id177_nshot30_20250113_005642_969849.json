However, it isn't an absolute predictor without additional context.\n- The household size of 4 shows mixed results; thus, it's weighted as a medium-risk factor alone.\n- Parental status at age 12 has been frequently seen across varied outcomes and is assigned low risk by itself.\n\nGiven these factors, the individual resembles examples with a 'NO' outcome more closely than those with a 'YES'. The prediction leans towards \"NO\" recidivism within three years, but there's moderate uncertainty due to employment status being a significant concern. Thus, confidence in this prediction is set at 75%.",
