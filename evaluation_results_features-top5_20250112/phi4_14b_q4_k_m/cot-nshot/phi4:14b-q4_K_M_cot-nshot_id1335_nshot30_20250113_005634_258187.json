This factor is considered high due to its consistent correlation with positive outcomes.\n\n- **Marital Status:** Being never married and not cohabiting does not strongly correlate directly with either outcome across all examples, making it medium in weight.\n\n- **Employment History (Held 1 Job):** Holding only one job has been associated with higher recidivism in several examples (e.g., Examples 5 and 12). This makes it a high-risk factor.\n\n- **Household Size (8):** Larger household sizes can indicate potential stress or resource constraints, which are risk factors for recidivism. Although not explicitly addressed as high risk alone, when combined with other factors, its weight is increased to high.\n\n- **Parental Status at Age 12:** This was considered medium in impact since it appears less frequently and decisively compared to gender and employment history.\n\nOverall, considering the combination of these weighted factors, particularly the high-risk indicators of being male, having held only one job, and having a large household size, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" with moderate confidence (75%).",
