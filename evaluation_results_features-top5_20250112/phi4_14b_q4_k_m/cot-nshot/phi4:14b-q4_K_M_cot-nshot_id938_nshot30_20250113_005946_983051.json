    "raw_message_text": "To predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case, we need to assign relative weights to each risk factor based on patterns observed in the example cases. Here is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Risk Factor Analysis\n\n1. **Gender (Male)**\n   - Observation: Out of 30 examples, males had a higher likelihood of rearrest recidivism compared to females.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Males are more frequently associated with a \"YES\" outcome in the dataset.\n\n2. **Marital Status (Never Married)**\n   - Observation: This factor is consistent across all examples, so it does not differentiate outcomes on its own.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: It appears to have no significant impact on recidivism when isolated.\n\n3. **Cohabitation Status (Cohabiting)**\n   - Observation: Cohabiting males had a higher incidence of rearrest (\"YES\") compared to non-cohabiting.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Cohabitation appears to increase risk slightly, especially for males.\n\n4. **Number of Jobs Held (3 jobs)**\n   - Observation: Males with 1 job generally had lower recidivism rates, while those with 2 or more jobs showed mixed outcomes.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Holding multiple jobs may indicate instability or stress factors contributing to higher risk.\n\n5. **Household Size (4)**\n   - Observation: Household size does not show a clear pattern correlating directly with recidivism outcomes.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: It is less significant compared to other factors like gender and cohabitation status.\n\n6. **Living Situation at Age 12 (Biological Mother, Marital Status Unknown)**\n   - Observation: Living with a single parent or in uncertain family situations seems associated with higher risk for males.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Uncertain or less stable early home environments may contribute to recidivism.\n\n### Prediction\n\nGiven the weighted analysis:\n\n- **Gender (Male):** High risk factor, leaning towards \"YES.\"\n- **Cohabitation Status (Cohabiting):** Medium risk factor, leaning towards \"YES.\"\n- **Number of Jobs Held (3 jobs) and Living Situation at Age 12:** Both medium risk factors, leaning towards \"YES.\"\n\nCombining these factors, the presence of multiple medium to high-risk elements suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males have a higher incidence of recidivism in the dataset.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married status is common across examples and does not differentiate outcomes.\"),\n    (\"cohabitation_status\", \"medium\", \"Cohabiting males show increased risk compared to non-cohabiting.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs_held\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs may indicate instability, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Household size does not strongly correlate with recidivism outcomes.\"),\n    (\"living_situation_at_age_12\", \"medium\", \"Uncertain or less stable early home environments are associated with higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
