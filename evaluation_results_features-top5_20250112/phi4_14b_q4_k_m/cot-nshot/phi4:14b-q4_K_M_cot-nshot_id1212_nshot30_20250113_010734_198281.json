In the provided examples, all males who reoffended had this factor.\n\n2. **Marital Status (Never married, Not cohabiting):** While never being married or cohabiting is common in both outcomes, it appears more frequently among those who recidivate, especially males.\n\n3. **Employment Status (Currently unemployed):** Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism, particularly for males, as seen in multiple YES examples.\n\n4. **Household Size (6):** Although larger household sizes are common among non-recidivists, this factor alone doesn't strongly predict outcomes and may be influenced by other factors like economic strain.\n\n5. **Parental Status at Age 12 (Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown):** This condition is present in both recidivist and non-recidivist examples, suggesting it has a neutral impact on the outcome.\n\nGiven these analyses, the combination of being male, currently unemployed, and never married or cohabiting suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism. The confidence level reflects the consistency of these factors with previous YES outcomes but acknowledges some variability due to other less significant factors.",
