We'll focus on factors such as gender, marital status, cohabitation status, employment history, household size, and parental living situation at age 12.\n\n### Analysis of Risk Factors:\n\n1. **Gender**:\n   - Males have a higher probability of recidivism (YES outcomes) compared to females.\n   - Weight: High\n\n2. **Marital Status**:\n   - Never married status appears in all examples, suggesting it may not be a significant differentiator on its own.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n3. **Cohabitation Status**:\n   - Cohabiting males have shown both YES and NO outcomes, but non-cohabiting males have more consistent patterns.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n4. **Number of Jobs Held**:\n   - Males with fewer jobs (1-2) generally have NO outcomes except for a few exceptions.\n   - Holding 3 or more jobs correlates with a higher likelihood of recidivism (YES).\n   - Weight: High\n\n5. **Household Size**:\n   - Larger household sizes do not consistently correlate with recidivism outcomes.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n6. **Parental Living Situation at Age 12**:\n   - Living with both biological parents does not strongly predict recidivism, but living with a single parent or unknown status shows mixed results.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n### Applying Weights to the New Case:\n\n- **Gender**: Male (High risk)\n- **Marital Status**: Never married (Low impact)\n- **Cohabitation Status**: Not cohabiting (Medium risk)\n- **Number of Jobs Held**: 1 job (High risk for males)\n- **Household Size**: 6 (Low impact)\n- **Parental Living Situation at Age 12**: Not specified, but less relevant given other factors\n\n### Prediction:\n\nGiven the high weight assigned to gender and number of jobs held, combined with medium weight on cohabitation status, the case presents a higher risk for recidivism.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males have a higher probability of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married status is consistent across examples and does not strongly differentiate outcomes.\"),\n    (\"cohabitation_status\", \"medium\", \"Non-cohabiting males show varied patterns, but generally more consistent with NO outcomes.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs_held\", \"high\", \"Males holding fewer jobs have higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Household size does not consistently correlate with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"parental_living_situation_at_age_12\", \"medium\", \"Mixed results for different living situations at age 12.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
