The key differentiator appears to be gender, particularly for males with a history of multiple job changes, which increases recidivism risk. However, given that this individual lived with both biological parents at age 12\u2014a factor associated with non-rearrested individuals\u2014the prediction leans towards \"NO\" rearrest outcome, though the confidence is moderate due to variability in outcomes based on job history and gender.",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
