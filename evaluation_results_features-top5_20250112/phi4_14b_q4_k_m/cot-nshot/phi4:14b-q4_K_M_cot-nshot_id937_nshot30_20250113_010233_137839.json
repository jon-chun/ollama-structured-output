This factor is given high weight due to its consistent association with stability and reduced risk.\n\n3. **Employment History:** Holding only one job might suggest some instability but does not show a strong correlation with recidivism in the data for females, hence it's considered medium.\n\n4. **Household Size:** There is no clear pattern linking household size directly to recidivism outcomes in the examples provided; thus, its weight is low.\n\n5. **Parental Household Composition at Age 12:** The impact of living with a single biological parent or unknown marital status has mixed results but seems less influential for females compared to other factors, hence it's medium.\n\nGiven these weighted risk factors and their influence on recidivism outcomes, the prediction for this female case is 'NO' with high confidence.",
