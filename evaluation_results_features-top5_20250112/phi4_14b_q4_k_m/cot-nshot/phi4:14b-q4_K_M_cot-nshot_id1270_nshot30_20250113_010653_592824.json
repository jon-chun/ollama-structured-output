Unemployment appears as a significant factor in some positive recidivism examples but not consistently enough to be considered high by itself.\n\n- **Number of Jobs Held:** The current unemployment status provides less information than past job stability, thus it's weighted low. Nonetheless, having fewer jobs historically could indicate instability, hence the medium weight when coupled with unemployment.\n\n- **Household Size:** A household size of 4 has been assigned a medium weight as it appears in both outcomes without strong correlation to either side but does show some influence when considered in context with other factors.\n\n- **Living Arrangement at Age 12:** The presence of biological mother is common and doesn't strongly predict recidivism, thus weighted low.\n\nOverall, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" due to the presence of several moderate-to-low risk factors without additional high-risk indicators, such as higher number of jobs held or cohabitation status that might increase risk. Confidence is set at 70% given the variability and complexity in interpreting these risk factors individually and collectively.",
