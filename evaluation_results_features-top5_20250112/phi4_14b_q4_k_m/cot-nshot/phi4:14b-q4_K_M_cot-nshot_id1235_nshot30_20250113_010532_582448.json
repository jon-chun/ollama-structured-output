This justifies assigning it a medium risk level.\n  \n- **Marital Status (Never married):** The data shows no clear trend towards increased recidivism for those who are never married, thus assigned a low weight.\n\n- **Cohabitation (Not cohabiting):** Most individuals not cohabiting in the dataset had NO outcomes, suggesting lower risk and therefore a low weight is appropriate.\n\n- **Job Stability (Held 2 jobs):** The presence of multiple jobs indicates some stability, yet holding only two jobs shows moderate variability with both YES and NO outcomes, leading to a medium weight.\n\n- **Household Size (7):** A household size of 7 is significantly larger than others in the dataset. Larger households often indicate higher stress or resource strain, thus receiving a high risk weight.\n\n- **Family Structure at Age 12:** Living with a biological mother and an unknown marital status presents some instability, but similar setups in the data predominantly resulted in NO outcomes; hence it receives a medium weight due to potential variability.\n\nThe decision for a \"NO\" prediction is primarily influenced by the predominance of NO outcomes across several risk factors such as not cohabiting and living with a biological mother. The high household size slightly raises concern but does not outweigh other mitigating factors in this context. Confidence is set at 75 due to moderate certainty from these trends, acknowledging some variability within similar profiles.",
