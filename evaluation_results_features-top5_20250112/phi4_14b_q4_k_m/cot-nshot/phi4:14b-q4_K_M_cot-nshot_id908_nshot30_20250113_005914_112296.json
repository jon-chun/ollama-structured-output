While many with 1 job had 'NO' outcomes, the presence of exceptions suggests some level of risk.\n\n5. **Household Size (4)**: This factor shows no strong correlation with recidivism in this dataset; thus, it's considered low-risk.\n\n6. **Parental Status at Age 12**: The specific combination of living with a biological mother and unknown marital status at age 12 is associated with some 'YES' outcomes but not overwhelmingly so. It provides moderate risk.\n\n**Overall Prediction:**\n\nConsidering these weighted factors, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for recidivism due to the predominance of similar profiles resulting in non-recidivism. However, given the moderate risks from employment history and parental status, there is a reasonable level of uncertainty, reflected in an 75% confidence score.",
