This suggests that being male is a significant risk factor.\n\n- **Marital Status (Never Married):** While this status appears consistently across many examples, it does not independently predict high or low recidivism; thus, its weight remains medium.\n\n- **Cohabitation Status (Not Cohabiting):** Most non-recidivists are not cohabiting. However, since some recidivists also share this trait, its predictive power is considered low.\n\n- **Number of Jobs Held (1 Job):** Having only one job has shown a moderate association with positive recidivism outcomes in the data set. Thus, it carries medium risk weight.\n\n- **Household Size (5):** This factor does not show strong correlation either way and appears less frequently, assigning it a low weight.\n\n- **Parental Status at Age 12 (Both Biological Parents):** Consistently, individuals living with both biological parents tend to have non-recidivist outcomes, suggesting this reduces risk. Therefore, its influence is considered low for recidivism. \n\nCombining these factors leads to the prediction that this individual has a lower likelihood of recidivism (\"NO\"), but there remains some uncertainty due to variations in similar cases (hence a confidence level of 75).",
