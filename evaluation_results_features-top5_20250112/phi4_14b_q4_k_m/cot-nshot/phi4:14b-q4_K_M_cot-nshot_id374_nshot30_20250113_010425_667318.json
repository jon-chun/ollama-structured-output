They are common across both positive and negative examples.\n\n- **Employment History:** Holding 2 jobs seems to be less risky compared to holding 4, which has more instances of 'YES' outcomes, particularly among males. However, it remains a moderate risk factor due to mixed results.\n\n- **Household Size & Parental Structure at Age 12:** A household size of 4 and living with both biological parents often correlate with 'NO' outcomes, suggesting stability and lower recidivism risk. These factors are moderately weighted as exceptions exist but are limited in number. \n\nGiven the combination of these factors for this particular case, the prediction leans towards a 'NO' outcome with moderate to high confidence based on observed patterns in the dataset.",
