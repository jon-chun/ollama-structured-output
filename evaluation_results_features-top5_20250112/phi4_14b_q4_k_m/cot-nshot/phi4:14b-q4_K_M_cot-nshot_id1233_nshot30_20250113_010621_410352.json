    "raw_message_text": "To analyze the risk factors and assign weights, we will consider patterns observed in the example cases. We will focus on gender, marital status/cohabitation, employment history, household size, and parental living situation at age 12.\n\n### Risk Factor Analysis:\n\n1. **Gender**:\n   - Observations suggest that males have a higher likelihood of recidivism (YES outcomes) compared to females.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: In the provided examples, all YES outcomes for recidivism occurred with males, indicating a significant gender disparity.\n\n2. **Marital Status/Cohabitation**:\n   - Cohabiting status seems to have mixed results; however, non-cohabiting individuals generally show lower recidivism.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Cohabiting status alone does not consistently predict outcomes but may interact with other factors.\n\n3. **Employment History**:\n   - Holding multiple jobs (e.g., 4 jobs) is associated with higher recidivism in males, while females show no such pattern.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Employment stability might be a risk factor for males but less so for females.\n\n4. **Household Size**:\n   - Larger household sizes do not consistently correlate with higher recidivism outcomes.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Household size alone does not appear to significantly influence the outcome based on examples.\n\n5. **Parental Living Situation at Age 12**:\n   - Living with both biological parents is generally associated with lower recidivism, while living with a single parent or adoptive parents shows mixed results.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: The presence of both biological parents seems to provide stability, reducing risk.\n\n### Case Analysis:\n\nFor the case in question:\n- **Gender**: Female (low risk)\n- **Marital Status/Cohabitation**: Cohabiting (medium risk)\n- **Employment History**: Held 1 job (low risk)\n- **Household Size**: Household size of 2 (low risk)\n- **Parental Living Situation at Age 12**: Lived with biological mother, marital status unknown (medium risk)\n\n### Prediction:\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The individual is female, which significantly lowers the risk.\n- Cohabiting and living with a single parent introduce some risk but are mitigated by gender and employment history.\n\n**Prediction**: NO\n**Confidence**: 80\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males have consistently shown higher recidivism rates in the examples.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_cohabitation\", \"medium\", \"Cohabiting status shows mixed results but generally lower risk for females.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs increase risk for males; less impact on females.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Household size does not consistently correlate with outcomes.\"),\n    (\"parental_living_situation_at_age_12\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents generally reduces risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
