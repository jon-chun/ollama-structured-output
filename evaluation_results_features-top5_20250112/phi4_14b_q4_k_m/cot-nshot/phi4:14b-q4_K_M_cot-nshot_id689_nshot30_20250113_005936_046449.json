    "raw_message_text": "To analyze the provided examples, we need to identify patterns associated with the risk factors that result in a \"YES\" outcome (recidivism) versus a \"NO\" outcome. Here's an analysis of each factor:\n\n1. **Gender**:\n   - Males generally have a higher likelihood of recidivism (\"YES\") compared to females.\n   - Weight: High\n\n2. **Marital Status and Cohabitation**:\n   - The examples indicate that cohabiting status does not significantly affect the outcome for males, while being never married is common across all examples, regardless of outcome.\n   - Never married and not cohabiting do not show a strong direct correlation with recidivism outcomes. \n   - Weight: Low\n\n3. **Employment**:\n   - Males who have held 4 jobs consistently show a higher likelihood of recidivism (\"YES\").\n   - Holding more than 2 jobs seems to increase the risk.\n   - Unemployment shows mixed results but is less frequently associated with \"YES\" outcomes for males.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n4. **Household Size**:\n   - Larger household sizes (5 or above) are not strongly correlated with recidivism (\"NO\") in these examples.\n   - Household size of 3 appears in both \"YES\" and \"NO\" outcomes, making it less predictive on its own.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n5. **Parental Living Situation at Age 12**:\n   - Males who lived with both biological parents at age 12 have a mix of outcomes but tend to lean towards \"NO\".\n   - Living with one biological parent or an unknown marital status seems slightly more associated with recidivism (\"YES\"), especially when combined with other risk factors.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\nGiven these analyses, let's apply the weights and reasoning to the specific case:\n\n- **Gender**: Male (High weight, as males show higher recidivism)\n- **Marital Status and Cohabitation**: Never married, not cohabiting (Low weight, less predictive)\n- **Employment**: Held 2 jobs (Medium weight, moderate risk compared to holding more than 2 jobs)\n- **Household Size**: Household size of 3 (Low weight, mixed outcomes)\n- **Parental Living Situation at Age 12**: Lived with biological dad, marital status unknown (Medium weight, slightly higher risk)\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males have a higher likelihood of recidivism based on provided examples.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Neither never married nor not cohabiting is strongly correlated with outcomes for males.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding 2 jobs shows moderate risk compared to holding more than 2 jobs.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Household size of 3 shows mixed outcomes, making it less predictive.\"),\n    (\"parental_living_situation_at_age_12\", \"medium\", \"Lived with one biological parent and marital status unknown is slightly more associated with recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\nThe prediction is \"NO\" because, while there are some risk factors present (gender, employment), the overall pattern from the examples suggests that without a combination of higher-risk indicators (like holding more than 2 jobs or larger household size), the likelihood of recidivism remains lower. The confidence level is set at 70 due to mixed outcomes in similar scenarios.",
