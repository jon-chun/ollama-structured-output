This risk factor is assigned a high weight.\n\n2. **Marital Status:** While never being married has been seen in both outcomes for males, it appears more frequently among those who do not reoffend. However, the impact is less definitive compared to gender or cohabitation status, thus a medium weight is applied.\n\n3. **Cohabiting Status:** Cohabiting status appears as a significant predictor of recidivism for males, suggesting instability that could lead to higher risk behaviors or influences.\n\n4. **Number of Jobs Held:** The number of jobs held shows some correlation with outcomes. Those who held 4 jobs had instances of 'YES' outcomes, indicating potential instability or dissatisfaction leading to recidivism. Thus, holding 3 jobs is considered a medium risk factor in this context.\n\n5. **Household Size:** A household size of 4 has not shown strong predictive power towards either outcome but generally aligns more with neutral or protective scenarios for males.\n\n6. **Living Arrangement at Age 12:** Being raised by both biological parents seems to serve as a protective factor, particularly among males, and is associated with fewer instances of recidivism in the dataset provided.\n\nGiven these weighted factors and their interactions, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism, but with moderate confidence due to the mixed indicators present. The high impact of gender and cohabitation status tips the balance despite some protective factors like household upbringing. Confidence is at 70%, reflecting both strong predictive elements and mitigating factors in the analysis.",
