Thus, this has been assigned a high weight.\n5. **Household Size:** Household size of 4 appeared among both reoffenders and non-reoffenders without strong correlation to outcomes.\n6. **Living Situation at Age 12:** Living with a biological mother whose marital status was unknown did not show a clear pattern but combined unfavorably in some cases leading to recidivism.\n\nThe combination of being male, holding four jobs, and having other moderate risk factors leads to predicting \"YES\" for this particular case with medium confidence. The presence of multiple high-risk factors contributes to the higher probability of recidivism.",
