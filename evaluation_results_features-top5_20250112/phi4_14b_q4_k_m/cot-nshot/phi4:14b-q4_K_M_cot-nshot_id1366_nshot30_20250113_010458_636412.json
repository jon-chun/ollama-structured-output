This factor is weighted as low due to its consistent pattern across examples.\n\n2. **Marital Status**: Being never married appears frequently in both 'YES' and 'NO' outcomes, suggesting it has little predictive power on its own. Thus, it's assigned a low weight.\n\n3. **Cohabitation Status**: Non-cohabiting individuals tend towards 'NO', but this is not as strong a predictor as gender. Therefore, it receives a medium weight.\n\n4. **Number of Jobs Held**: Holding four jobs suggests potential instability or difficulty in maintaining employment, which correlates with higher recidivism in males and some females. This factor is weighted high due to its significant impact on outcomes.\n\n5. **Household Size**: A household size of 4 does not strongly correlate with either outcome, but larger households have mixed results. It's given a medium weight as it can influence stability and support systems.\n\n6. **Parental Status at Age 12**: Living with one biological parent, particularly the mother, has shown higher recidivism in some cases, especially when combined with other risk factors like multiple jobs. This is weighted high due to its potential impact on outcomes.\n\nThe combination of these factors, especially holding four jobs and living with one biological parent, leads to a prediction of 'YES' for recidivism, with moderate confidence given the mixed patterns observed in similar cases.",
