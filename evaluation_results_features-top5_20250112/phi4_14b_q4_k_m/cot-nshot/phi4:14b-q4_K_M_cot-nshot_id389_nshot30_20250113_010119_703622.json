In this case, holding 3 jobs is less concerning than having more but still notable.\n\n5. **Household Size:** Doesn't appear as a strong predictor unless it aligns with other risk factors.\n\n6. **Parental Living Situation at Age 12:** Lived with the biological mother and unknown marital status shows some correlation with recidivism, though not definitively predictive.\n\nThe overall analysis suggests that while there are several medium-risk factors present, they do not collectively indicate a high likelihood of recidivism for this specific case. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with moderate confidence.",
