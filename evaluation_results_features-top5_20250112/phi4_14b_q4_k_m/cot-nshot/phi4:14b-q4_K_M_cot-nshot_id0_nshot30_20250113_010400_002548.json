    "raw_message_text": "To analyze the given examples, we need to identify patterns associated with recidivism outcomes. We'll assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor based on their observed influence in these examples.\n\n### Analysis of Risk Factors:\n\n1. **Gender**: \n   - Males generally have a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n   - Examples: Most males with positive outcomes (YES) had other significant risk factors.\n   - Weight: High for males, Low for females.\n\n2. **Marital Status**:\n   - Never married is common among both outcomes but doesn't distinctly correlate with recidivism in the dataset.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n3. **Cohabitation**:\n   - Cohabiting seems to have a mixed influence; however, males who cohabited and had other risk factors (e.g., multiple jobs) tended towards YES.\n   - Weight: Medium for males, Low for females.\n\n4. **Employment Status**:\n   - Unemployment is present in some NO outcomes but also in YES cases with additional risk factors.\n   - Weight: High if combined with other risk factors.\n\n5. **Number of Jobs Held**:\n   - Holding multiple jobs (3 or more) correlates with higher recidivism for males.\n   - Weight: Medium to High, depending on context and gender.\n\n6. **Household Size**:\n   - Larger household sizes are present in both outcomes but seem more common in NO cases unless combined with other risk factors.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n7. **Parental Status at Age 12**:\n   - Living with biological parents or mother alone doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism unless combined with other risk factors.\n   - Weight: Medium for males, Low for females.\n\n### Applying Weights to the New Case:\n\n- **Gender (Male)**: High\n- **Marital Status (Never Married)**: Medium\n- **Cohabitation**: Medium\n- **Employment Status (Unemployed)**: High\n- **Number of Jobs Held**: Not applicable, as currently unemployed.\n- **Household Size (6)**: Low\n- **Parental Status at Age 12 (Lived with Biological Mother)**: Medium\n\n### Prediction for the New Case:\n\nGiven the high weight on gender and employment status, combined with medium weights on cohabitation and parental status, the risk factors suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism. The presence of multiple high-weighted risk factors in males, especially when unemployed, supports this conclusion.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males have shown a higher tendency towards recidivism in the dataset.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married is common but not strongly indicative alone.\"),\n    (\"cohabitation\", \"medium\", \"Cohabiting males with other risk factors tend towards YES outcomes.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment significantly increases risk, especially for males.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs_held\", \"not applicable\", \"Currently unemployed, so not relevant.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Larger household sizes do not strongly correlate with recidivism alone.\"),\n    (\"parental_status_at_age_12\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother has some influence for males.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
