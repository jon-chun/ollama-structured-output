    "raw_message_text": "To approach this problem, we will analyze the example cases provided to determine which risk factors appear to have more influence on the likelihood of a three-year rearrest recidivism outcome. We will then apply these insights to assign relative weights to the risk factors for the new case.\n\n### Analysis of Example Cases\n\n1. **Gender:**\n   - Females generally show lower recurrence rates compared to males, with few exceptions.\n   - Male cases have both \"YES\" and \"NO\" outcomes, but more often result in a \"YES\".\n\n2. **Marital Status/Cohabitation:**\n   - Cohabiting seems neutral or slightly protective as most cohabiting females showed \"NO\".\n   - Never married status alone does not indicate high recidivism.\n\n3. **Employment Stability (Number of Jobs Held):**\n   - More jobs held correlates with a higher likelihood of recidivism, particularly for males.\n   - Holding 4 jobs shows a consistent pattern of increased risk among males.\n\n4. **Household Size:**\n   - Larger household sizes do not show a clear trend towards increased or decreased recidivism.\n   - Household size appears less predictive than employment stability and gender.\n\n5. **Parental Status at Age 12:**\n   - Living with both biological parents shows mixed results, but generally correlates with \"NO\" outcomes.\n   - Unknown marital status of parent(s) does not show a strong pattern towards higher risk.\n\n### Assigning Weights to Risk Factors for the New Case\n\n1. **Gender (Female):**  \n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Females have consistently lower recidivism rates in the examples provided, suggesting that being female is protective against rearrest.\n\n2. **Marital Status/Cohabitation (Never Married, Not Cohabitating):**  \n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: The status of never being married and not cohabiting does not show a strong correlation with increased recidivism in the examples.\n\n3. **Number of Jobs Held (2 Jobs):**  \n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Holding 2 jobs is neutral compared to higher numbers, which correlate more strongly with male recidivism, but less than 4 jobs.\n\n4. **Household Size (4 People):**  \n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Household size does not show a clear predictive pattern in the examples provided and seems to be of lesser importance.\n\n5. **Parental Status at Age 12 (Lived with Biological Dad, Marital Status Unknown):**  \n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: The unknown marital status may introduce some uncertainty; however, living with biological parents generally correlates more with \"NO\" outcomes in examples.\n\n### Prediction for the New Case\n\nConsidering the above weights and trends observed from the example cases:\n\n- Being female reduces risk substantially.\n- Employment stability at 2 jobs is moderate but not extreme.\n- Other factors (household size, parental status) do not strongly indicate a high risk of recidivism.\n\n**Prediction: NO**\n\nGiven that females in similar conditions generally show lower rates of recidivism, and the absence of stronger risk indicators:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females have consistently shown lower recidivism rates across examples.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_cohabitation\", \"low\", \"Never married and not cohabiting does not correlate with higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs_held\", \"medium\", \"Holding 2 jobs is moderate; more than this shows increased risk, especially for males.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Household size does not show a clear predictive pattern in examples.\"),\n    (\"parental_status_at_age_12\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological parents generally correlates with lower recidivism, but unknown marital status adds uncertainty.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction is made with an 80% confidence level based on the observed trends and weighting of risk factors.",
