This factor is weighted as medium because it has a consistent, though not exclusive, influence on outcomes.\n  \n- **Marital Status:** 'Never married' appears commonly across examples without showing strong predictive power for either outcome. Thus, it is given low weight.\n\n- **Cohabitation Status:** Cohabiting males have more instances of 'NO' outcomes compared to non-cohabiting ones. This suggests some protective effect against recidivism, giving this factor medium weight.\n\n- **Job History:** The data shows varied job histories across both outcomes, indicating that the number of jobs held is not a strong predictor on its own, hence it's weighted low.\n\n- **Household Size:** Larger household sizes have been more frequently associated with 'NO' outcomes. This observation gives this factor medium weight.\n\n- **Parental Status at Age 12:** There are mixed results for living situations at age 12 across the examples, but a trend towards 'NO' when living with one parent (biological mother) is noted. Therefore, it's weighted as medium.\n\nGiven these analyses and the fact that several factors lean towards a 'NO' outcome, the prediction for this case is \"NO\" with moderate confidence of 75%.",
