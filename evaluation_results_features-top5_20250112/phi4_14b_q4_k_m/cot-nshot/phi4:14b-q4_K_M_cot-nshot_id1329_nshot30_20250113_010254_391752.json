This suggests that gender might be an indicator of higher risk for males.\n\n2. **Marital Status: Never Married** - The status of being never married appears frequently across both outcomes without a strong correlation to recidivism. Therefore, it has been assigned a low weight.\n\n3. **Cohabitation: Not Cohabiting** - The data includes both cohabiting and not cohabiting individuals with varied outcomes. This factor does not show a clear pattern correlating strongly with rearrest, thus receiving a low weight.\n\n4. **Number of Jobs Held: 2 jobs** - Individuals who held 2 jobs mostly had NO outcomes except for one case (Example #26). However, holding more jobs (e.g., 4) tends to correlate with higher recidivism rates, so this factor is given a medium weight due to its moderate risk association.\n\n5. **Household Size: 9** - Larger household sizes have been associated with higher recidivism in the data set, particularly when combined with other high-risk factors like holding multiple jobs (e.g., Example #5). This factor has been assigned a high weight based on observed patterns.\n\n6. **Living Situation at Age 12: Both Biological Parents** - Living with both biological parents at age 12 generally correlates with NO outcomes in the examples, suggesting it may be a stabilizing factor and thus receives a low weight.\n\nBased on this analysis, the prediction for this specific case is \"YES\" due to the high household size combined with other moderately weighted risk factors. The confidence level of 65 reflects uncertainty due to limited data points but recognizes the higher risk associated with larger household sizes among males holding multiple jobs.",
