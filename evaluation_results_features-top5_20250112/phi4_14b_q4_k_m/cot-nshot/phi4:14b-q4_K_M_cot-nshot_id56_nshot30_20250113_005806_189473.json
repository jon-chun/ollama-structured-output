This is a strong indicator favoring a 'NO' outcome.\n\n- **Marital Status**: The factor of being never married has appeared across both genders but does not strongly predict outcomes without considering other factors. Its medium weight reflects its mixed appearance in the data.\n\n- **Cohabiting Status**: Cohabitation provides potential social stability, reducing recidivism risk. It shows positive outcomes more than negative ones for females but varies based on context (e.g., Example #26 with a male).\n\n- **Job History**: Having held two jobs suggests employment stability compared to those with many job changes, aligning with lower recidivism instances.\n\n- **Household Size**: While not strongly indicative by itself, a household size of four is common among examples without recidivism and offers potential for stable living conditions.\n\n- **Parental Status at Age 12**: The presence of only the biological mother during childhood appears more in cases without recidivism, especially for females.\n\nOverall, combining these factors, particularly with a female subject who has shown stability through employment and cohabitation, strongly suggests a 'NO' prediction for recidivism, though there is some variability in individual examples that slightly reduces confidence to 75.",
