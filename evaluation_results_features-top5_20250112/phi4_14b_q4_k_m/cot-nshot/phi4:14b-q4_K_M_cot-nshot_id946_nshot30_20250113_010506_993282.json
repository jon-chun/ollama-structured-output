Thus, it's considered a low risk factor.\n  \n- **Marital Status (Separated)**: Separation may introduce instability or stress compared to never being married but doesn't seem as influential as cohabitation status for males. It is assessed as medium risk.\n\n- **Cohabitation Status**: Not cohabiting does not strongly correlate with high recidivism in females, marking it as a low risk factor.\n\n- **Employment Status (Unemployed)**: Unemployment is consistently linked to higher recidivism across genders, making it a high-risk factor.\n\n- **Household Size (9)**: A larger household could introduce stress or instability but doesn't have as strong an impact as employment status. Therefore, it's considered medium risk.\n\n- **Parental Status at Age 12**: The examples show no clear pattern of recidivism based on parental status at age 12 for females, making this a low-risk factor.\n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" due to the high weight given to unemployment and medium weights assigned to marital status and household size. However, the confidence level is set at 70 because while employment is a strong indicator, other factors like gender and cohabitation status are less impactful for females according to the examples provided.",

using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a female who is separated, not cohabiting and is currently unemployed with a household size of 9 and lived with their other adults, biological parent status unknown, not group quarters at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\",
