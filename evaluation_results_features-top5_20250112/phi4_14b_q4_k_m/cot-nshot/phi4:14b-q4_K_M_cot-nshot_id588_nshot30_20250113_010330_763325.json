In examples where multiple job changes occurred (e.g., 4 jobs), there was a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\n5. **Household Size**: A smaller household size might imply less familial support, correlating in some instances with higher recidivism rates when combined with other factors.\n\n6. **Parental Status at Age 12**: Living with a biological mother is common among non-recidivist cases but has also appeared in recidivist examples, suggesting limited impact as an isolated factor.\n\nGiven the high instability indicated by holding multiple jobs and a smaller household size, I predict a higher risk of recidivism for this individual. The confidence level reflects that while certain factors are strongly indicative, there is still variability across similar cases.",
