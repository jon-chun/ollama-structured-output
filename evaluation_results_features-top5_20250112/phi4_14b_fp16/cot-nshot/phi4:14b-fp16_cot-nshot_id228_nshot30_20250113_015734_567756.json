Thus, this factor is weighted high.\n  \n- **Marital Status (Never Married)**: This status appears frequently in both outcomes but does not distinctly correlate strongly with either 'YES' or 'NO'. It has a medium weight.\n\n- **Cohabitation Status (Not Cohabiting)**: As most examples are 'not cohabiting', this factor seems to have little impact on recidivism alone, thus assigned low weight.\n\n- **Employment History (Held 2 Jobs)**: Holding 2 jobs appears in both 'YES' and 'NO' outcomes, suggesting it has a moderate influence. Therefore, it is weighted medium.\n\n- **Household Size (3)**: This size appears across various outcomes with no clear pattern of increased risk, so it's given low weight.\n\n- **Parental Living Arrangement at Age 12**: Lived with biological mother and unknown marital status shows mixed results but leans towards a moderate risk factor due to association in some 'YES' cases. Hence, medium weight is assigned.\n\n**Overall Prediction:** Given the combination of these factors and their respective weights, the prediction for this case is \"NO\" for recidivism, with a confidence level of 70%, acknowledging that while there are elements of risk, the majority of similar profiles in the dataset resulted in 'NO' outcomes.",
