This factor is given the highest weight due to its strong correlation with positive outcomes (rearrest).\n  \n- **Marital Status**: Being never married is common across all examples, suggesting it doesn't strongly influence the outcome by itself.\n\n- **Cohabitation Status**: Not cohabiting seems to correlate with higher recidivism when combined with other factors like employment history. Cohabiting appears less in positive outcomes, indicating a medium risk level.\n\n- **Employment History**: Holding 3 jobs is associated with higher recidivism (Examples 5, 12, and 15), making it a significant factor.\n\n- **Household Size**: There's no clear pattern linking household size to rearrest, so it\u2019s given the lowest weight. \n\nThe prediction of \"YES\" for recidivism is based on the high-risk factors present: male gender and employment history with multiple jobs. The confidence level is set at 75 due to strong correlations observed in similar cases.",
