Cohabiting individuals had better outcomes than singles, suggesting marriage would be even more protective.\n\n3. **Spouse Present:** Similar to cohabitation, having a spouse present likely offers social support and accountability, reducing risk further.\n\n4. **Employment History (1 job):** While holding only one job might suggest less work experience or stability, it didn't show strong correlation with recidivism for females in the examples.\n\n5. **Household Size:** Household size was generally neutral across the examples, as it did not correlate strongly with either positive or negative outcomes.\n\n6. **Parental Living Situation at Age 12:** This factor is somewhat uncertain due to lack of information about parental marital status, but living with a biological mother alone doesn't show strong correlation with recidivism for females in the data provided. \n\nGiven these weighted factors and their influence based on historical examples, it's predicted that this individual has a low likelihood of rearrest within three years, with high confidence due to the protective nature of being female and married.",
