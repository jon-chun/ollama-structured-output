The gender factor also contributes to an increased risk of recidivism. Other factors like household size and parental status at age 12 are given lower weights because they don't show a strong correlation with either outcome in the examples provided. The confidence level is set at 75 due to reasonable certainty based on observed patterns, although not all factors conclusively point towards one direction.",

their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
