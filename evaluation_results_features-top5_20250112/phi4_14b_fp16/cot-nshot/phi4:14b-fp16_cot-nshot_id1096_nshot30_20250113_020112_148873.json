They are assigned medium and low weights, respectively, because they do not strongly differentiate between recidivist or non-recidivist cases.\n\n- **Number of Jobs Held:** This factor is weighted as medium. While it suggests some level of instability, its impact on recidivism is mixed across the examples provided.\n\n- **Household Size:** Medium weight is assigned due to its presence in both 'YES' and 'NO' outcome groups, with no clear pattern indicating higher risk with larger household sizes.\n\n- **Parental Living Situation at Age 12:** This factor has low impact on recidivism outcomes as it appears across a range of cases without clear correlation.\n\nOverall, the prediction is \"NO\" for this case, given the strong influence of gender and lack of other strongly indicative factors pointing towards recidivism. The confidence level is set at 70 due to some ambiguity in job stability and household size effects.",
