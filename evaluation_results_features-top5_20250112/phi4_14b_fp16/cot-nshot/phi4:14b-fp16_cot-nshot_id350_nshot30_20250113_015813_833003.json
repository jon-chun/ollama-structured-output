Its interaction with other factors might be more relevant.\n\n- **Cohabiting (yes):** Cohabitation does not seem to significantly influence the outcome since both cohabiting females have NO outcomes.\n\n- **Jobs Held (1):** Holding one job is generally associated with a NO outcome, but there are exceptions among males. It's moderately predictive.\n\n- **Household Size (6):** Larger household sizes correlate with higher recidivism in males, suggesting it might be a risk factor for females as well, though the evidence is less clear.\n\n- **Family Structure at Age 12 (both biological parents):** This factor does not consistently predict outcomes, indicating low predictive power.\n\nThe prediction of \"NO\" is based on the predominance of NO outcomes among females and those with similar profiles in the dataset. The confidence level is set at 75 due to some variability in outcomes related to household size and jobs held.",
