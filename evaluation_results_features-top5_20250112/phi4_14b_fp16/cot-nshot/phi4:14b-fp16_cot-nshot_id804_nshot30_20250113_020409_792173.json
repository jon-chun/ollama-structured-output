Out of the four female cases with outcomes 'YES', three were unemployed or held only one job.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"The person is divorced, which may indicate past relationship instability, potentially correlating with higher risk than being never married or cohabiting as seen in examples.\"),\n    (\"cohabitation_status\", \"low\", \"Not cohabiting appears common across cases.

Therefore, gender is assigned a low weight for risk.\n- **Marital Status:** Divorced status suggests potential instability which might increase risk, hence medium weight.\n- **Cohabitation Status:** The absence of cohabitation does not show strong correlation with outcomes across examples; thus, it is given low weight.\n- **Employment History:** Holding two jobs aligns more closely with 'NO' outcomes. Although there are exceptions, the pattern suggests medium risk.\n- **Household Size:** A household size of 3 doesn't strongly correlate with either higher or lower recidivism across examples, thus assigned low weight.\n- **Parental Household Composition at Age 12:** Living with a biological mother has more 'NO' outcomes, though not exclusively. This factor is given medium weight due to some exceptions.\n\nThe prediction for this case leans towards \"NO\" based on the weighted analysis of risk factors and observed patterns in the examples provided. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty considering that some factors align more closely with non-recidivism cases but also acknowledging potential variability in outcomes.",
