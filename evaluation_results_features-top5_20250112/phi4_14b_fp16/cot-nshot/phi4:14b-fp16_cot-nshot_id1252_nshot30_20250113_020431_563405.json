Given that this individual is male, this factor alone suggests a higher risk.\n\n2. **Marital Status:** While never being married appears frequently among both groups (rearrested and not rearrested), it's often associated with other factors when predicting recidivism for males. However, its impact here is moderate because many examples show similar statuses without rearrest.\n\n3. **Cohabitation Status:** This factor does not significantly sway the outcome based on the data; thus, it has a low weight in this analysis.\n\n4. **Employment History:** Holding two jobs might suggest stability but for males, holding fewer jobs (e.g., one job) correlates with higher recidivism rates in some examples. Therefore, having held two jobs provides moderate protection against rearrest.\n\n5. **Household Size:** The size of the household does not appear to significantly affect recidivism outcomes independently, hence its low weight.\n\n6. **Parental Status at Age 12:** Having a biological mother present with another parent unknown has been associated more often with non-rearrest in similar cases, suggesting some degree of stability during formative years.\n\nThe combination of these weighted factors leads to the prediction that this individual is less likely to be rearrested within three years. The confidence level reflects the consistency observed in examples for similar profiles, though there remains some variability due to complex interactions between risk factors.",
