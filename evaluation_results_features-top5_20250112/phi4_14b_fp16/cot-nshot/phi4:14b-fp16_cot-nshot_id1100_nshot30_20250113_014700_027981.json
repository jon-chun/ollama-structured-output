Out of 30 cases, males with 'YES' outcomes outnumbered those with 'NO'.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status: Never Married\", \"medium\", \"This factor is common among both positive and negative outcomes, indicating it might not be as influential on its own.\"),\n    (\"Cohabitation: Not Cohabiting\", \"low\", \"Both 'YES' and 'NO' cases include individuals who are not cohabiting, suggesting this factor does not significantly impact recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs Held: 2 jobs\", \"medium\", \"Holding a moderate number of jobs seems to appear in both outcomes.

The confidence level reflects uncertainty due to less data on adoptive parents but leans towards no recidivism based on the observed patterns.",
