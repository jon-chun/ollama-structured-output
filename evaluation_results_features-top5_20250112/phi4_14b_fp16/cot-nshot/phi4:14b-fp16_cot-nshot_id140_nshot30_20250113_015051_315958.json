This individual has held 2 jobs, which suggests moderate stability.\n- **Household Size**: No strong correlation observed between household size and recidivism in the dataset, hence assigned a low weight.\n- **Parental Status at Age 12**: Living with biological mother and unknown marital status is more common among those with 'NO' outcomes. The presence of other factors like cohabitation could influence results, but here it remains neutral.\n\nGiven these weighted assessments, the prediction for this individual leans towards \"NO\" with moderate confidence due to the mixed influences of employment stability and gender.",
