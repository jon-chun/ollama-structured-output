It is considered a medium-risk factor due to its mixed association with recidivism in the examples.\n\n- **Household Size**: This factor showed no consistent pattern affecting outcomes, thus assigned a low weight.\n\n- **Parental Living Situation at Age 12**: The situation where only one parent was present or when marital status was unknown is moderately associated with reoffending, based on some cases. Therefore, this factor has medium significance.\n\nThe overall prediction for the given case leans towards \"NO\" due to the absence of strong risk factors collectively indicating a high likelihood of recidivism. However, the confidence level remains at 75% to account for variability and limited patterns in examples related to certain factors like job instability or single-parent upbringing.",
