Therefore, it's given medium weight.\n\n- **Employment History**: Unemployment is a significant factor for those who reoffended ('YES'), indicating high-risk potential when unemployed.\n\n- **Household Size**: Larger households are present in both outcomes and don't provide strong predictive power alone; thus, it\u2019s weighted as medium.\n\n- **Parental Status at Age 12**: Similar to marital status, this is common across many cases without clear correlation to recidivism risk. It's considered a low-risk factor for this analysis.\n\nThe prediction for the given case leans towards \"YES\" due to the high weight on unemployment history, which is a strong indicator in the dataset for increased recidivism risk. The confidence score of 70 reflects the presence of multiple moderate and one high-risk factors contributing to the decision.",
