Therefore, it is assigned a low weight.\n\n3. **Cohabitation (Not Cohabiting):** While non-cohabiting status is present in some 'YES' outcomes, the presence of other risk factors seems to play a more critical role. Thus, this factor receives a medium weight due to its potential combined effect with others.\n\n4. **Number of Jobs Held (2):** Holding two jobs is associated with both positive and negative outcomes, but the data shows that having fewer jobs sometimes correlates with 'NO' outcomes, leading to a medium weight assignment.\n\n5. **Household Size (4):** This factor does not show a clear pattern or strong correlation with either outcome, suggesting it has little predictive power, hence a low weight.\n\n6. **Parental Household at Age 12 (Biological Dad):** The configuration of living with a biological dad is less common and shows mixed results in the dataset, leading to a medium weight due to its potential influence when combined with other factors.\n\nThe prediction leans towards \"NO\" given the moderate risk factors present, but with a confidence level of 65, acknowledging some uncertainty due to mixed indicators.",
