This suggests instability and is thus weighted high as a risk factor for recidivism.\n\n5. **Household Size**: A household size of 5 appears frequently in both outcomes but slightly more in those with 'NO'. Therefore, it's considered medium due to its potential stress factors without strong correlation to recidivism.\n\n6. **Living Arrangement at Age 12**: Living with both biological parents is a common trait among those with 'NO' outcomes and does not appear in any of the 'YES' cases, suggesting a low risk for recidivism.\n\nThe prediction takes into account that while employment history is a significant concern (high weight), other factors are less indicative of recidivism risk. The overall confidence level is set at 75 due to the strong presence of protective factors outweighing the single high-risk factor.",
