A high count like five suggests higher risk, aligning with examples showing correlation to recidivism ('YES') when job changes are frequent.\n\n- **Household Size & Living Arrangement at Age 12:** Smaller household sizes and specific living arrangements have shown a tendency toward 'YES' outcomes in some cases but not definitively. The combination of these factors adds medium risk, especially when coupled with other high-risk indicators like gender and job history.\n\nGiven the weighted risks, this case leans towards a higher likelihood ('YES') for recidivism within 3 years, with moderate confidence due to mixed signals from household size and living arrangements.",
