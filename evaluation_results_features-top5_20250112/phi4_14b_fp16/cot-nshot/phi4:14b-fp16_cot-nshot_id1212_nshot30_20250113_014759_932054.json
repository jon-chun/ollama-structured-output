Among males who are 'YES' for rearrest, similar conditions like unemployment and cohabiting status appear consistently.\n\n2. **Marital Status (Never Married):** This factor is prevalent across both outcomes without being strongly indicative on its own, thus assigned a medium risk level based on consistency rather than impact.\n\n3. **Cohabiting Status (Not Cohabiting):** It appears frequently in 'NO' cases and does not significantly correlate with rearrest outcomes, leading to it being considered low risk.\n\n4. **Employment Status (Unemployed):** Unemployment aligns more closely with the 'YES' outcomes, suggesting a higher risk factor for recidivism.\n\n5. **Number of Jobs Held:** Similar logic applies here as employment status; those without current jobs or having unstable job histories appear in 'YES' cases but not exclusively so, leading to medium weighting.\n\n6. **Household Size (6):** This factor does not distinctly affect the outcome and is present across both 'YES' and 'NO' outcomes, indicating low risk.\n\n7. **Family Structure at Age 12:** While it appears in several examples, its impact on recidivism outcome isn't as strong as other factors, thus assigned a medium level of influence based on potential indirect effects rather than direct correlation with rearrests.\n\nThe prediction is \"NO\" due to the combination and distribution of risk factors leaning more towards the patterns seen in 'NO' outcomes. However, there remains some uncertainty (hence confidence at 70%) because unemployment presents a significant risk factor that could shift this case's outcome.",
