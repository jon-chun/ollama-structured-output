Medium weight is assigned as it had varied impact depending on other factors.\n- **Family Structure at Age 12:** Generally shows no strong pattern in the data provided, therefore low importance is assigned.\n\nGiven these analyses and based on similar cases, especially Example #27 where a female with comparable risk factors recidivated, the prediction leans towards 'YES', but with a confidence level of 75 due to variability in outcomes seen with other individuals.",
