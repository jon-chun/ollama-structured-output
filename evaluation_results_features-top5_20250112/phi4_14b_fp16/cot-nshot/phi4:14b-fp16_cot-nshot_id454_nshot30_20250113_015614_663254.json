This case is female, which suggests a lower risk.\n\n2. **Marital Status:** 'Never married' is common among both genders and does not strongly predict recidivism on its own.\n\n3. **Cohabitation Status:** Being not cohabiting aligns more with the majority of examples that resulted in a 'NO' outcome, suggesting it's not an independent risk factor for females.\n\n4. **Employment History:** Having held only one job is slightly concerning, as seen among some males who were rearrested. However, this factor does not seem to strongly predict recidivism for females.\n\n5. **Household Size:** While larger household sizes are present in both 'YES' and 'NO' outcomes, they do not appear to be a decisive factor for predicting recidivism on their own.\n\n6. **Parental Living Situation at Age 12:** This person lived with other adults (biological parent status unknown). Many examples who were not rearrested also had non-biological parental situations or similar living arrangements without high risk factors like unemployment.\n\nOverall, the combination of these factors, particularly being female and having a stable family environment at age 12, suggests a lower likelihood of recidivism. The confidence level is moderate due to the presence of employment history as a medium-risk factor but offset by gender and parental factors.",

their other adults, biological parent status unknown, not group quarters at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\",
