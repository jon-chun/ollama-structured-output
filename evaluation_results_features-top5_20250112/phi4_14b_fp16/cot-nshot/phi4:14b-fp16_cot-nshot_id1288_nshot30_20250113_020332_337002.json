However, not all males with similar profiles have recidivated, indicating other factors also play crucial roles.\n  \n- **Marital Status and Cohabiting Status:** These factors appear to be less predictive as many individuals across different outcomes share these statuses.\n\n- **Number of Jobs Held:** This seems highly indicative of the outcome. Those who held only one job were more likely to have a 'YES' outcome, pointing towards economic stability or lack thereof being crucial.\n\n- **Household Size:** While moderate in its influence, household size does not stand out as prominently as other factors like employment history or gender.\n\n- **Parental Structure at Age 12:** This factor showed varied outcomes and thus was assigned low weight.\n\nGiven the combination of these weighted risk factors, particularly emphasizing the number of jobs held and gender, the prediction for this case leans towards \"NO\" with moderate confidence. Although some factors suggest higher recidivism risks (e.g., being male), the individual's employment history does not align strongly with those who recidivated in previous examples. Thus, a \"NO\" outcome is predicted with 70% confidence.",
