However, other factors such as not cohabiting and living with biological parents at age 12 have shown less impact in this dataset. The overall pattern indicates that while employment status is highly significant, the combination of other factors suggests a lower likelihood of recidivism for this specific profile. Confidence is moderate due to some variability observed among similar profiles in the data.",
