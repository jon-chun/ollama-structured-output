While this shows some employment stability, it is less stable than holding 3 or more jobs, where males had a higher risk of recidivism (\"YES\").\n\n4. **Household Size:** A household size of 5 is neither very small nor large compared to other examples. The data does not suggest any strong correlation with either outcome based on household size alone.\n\n5. **Parental Household at Age 12:** Living with the biological mother and having an unknown marital status introduces some uncertainty, but this factor did not strongly correlate with \"YES\" outcomes in the provided examples.\n\nOverall, given these weighted factors, especially considering gender and marital stability, the prediction leans towards a \"NO\" outcome for recidivism. The confidence level is set at 70 due to the moderate certainty based on observed patterns, acknowledging some unknowns like parental household nuances.",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a female who is never married, not cohabiting
