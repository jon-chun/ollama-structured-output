This suggests gender plays a significant role.\n  \n- **Marital Status**: Never being married does not consistently correlate with recidivism outcomes and thus has low weight.\n\n- **Cohabiting**: Not cohabiting generally aligns with no recidivism, suggesting it is less influential (low weight).\n\n- **Number of Jobs Held**: Having held 2 jobs shows mixed results in the examples. Thus, this factor carries a medium risk level due to its inconsistent impact on outcomes.\n\n- **Household Size**: A household size of 5 tends towards a 'NO' outcome, indicating it has low influence on recidivism probability.\n\n- **Living Arrangement at Age 12**: This factor shows varied results in the examples and hence is assigned a medium weight due to its moderate but not decisive impact.\n\nGiven these weights, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" with moderate confidence of 75%, considering the individual's profile does not align closely with those that resulted in a positive recidivism outcome.",
