However, not all males recidivate, so this factor alone does not guarantee a YES outcome.\n\n- **Marital Status (Never Married)**: This is common across both outcomes and thus has limited predictive power on its own.\n\n- **Cohabiting Status (Not Cohabiting)**: Similar to marital status, this factor appears frequently in both recidivating and non-recidivating individuals, suggesting low individual impact.\n\n- **Job Stability (Held 2 Jobs)**: Medium weight is assigned because job instability correlates with higher recidivism rates. However, the presence of two jobs suggests moderate stability.\n\n- **Household Size (5)**: There's no clear pattern linking household size to recidivism in these examples, leading to a low weighting.\n\n- **Parental Composition at Age 12**: The unknown marital status of the other parent is notable among those who recidivated, suggesting medium weight for this factor.\n\nOverall, despite some risk factors pointing towards potential recidivism (male gender and job instability), others like household size and cohabiting status suggest a lower likelihood. Thus, given the mixed indicators, the prediction leans towards \"NO,\" with moderate confidence due to the balance of factors involved.",
