However, non-cohabitation and being unmarried were more common among those who reoffended.\n- **Employment Stability:** Holding only one job strongly correlated with increased risk based on the dataset.\n- **Household Size:** Larger households showed some correlation with recidivism but not as significantly as other factors.\n- **Parental Presence at Age 12:** The presence of a biological father, in this case, was deemed less impactful compared to employment and gender. \n\nThe combination of high-risk factors (gender and job stability) leads to the prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest with moderate confidence due to mixed influences from other factors.",
