This suggests it may be less critical for females.\n\n- **Parental Living Status at Age 12:** Females who lived with one parent and an unknown marital status typically had NO outcomes, suggesting moderate impact on recidivism risk.\n\nGiven the predominance of NO outcomes among females in similar scenarios and considering the mixed evidence for other factors, the prediction leans towards a NO outcome with reasonable confidence.",

their biological mother, marital status unknown at age 12.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual
