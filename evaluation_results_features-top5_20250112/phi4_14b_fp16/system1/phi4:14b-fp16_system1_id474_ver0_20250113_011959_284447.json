Being never married might suggest less stability, but cohabitation can provide some level of support.\n\n2. **Employment History:**\n   - Holding only one job could indicate potential instability or limited opportunities, which is a moderate risk factor.\n\n3. **Household Size and Family Dynamics:**\n   - A household size of 6 might suggest economic strain, which can be a risk factor, but living with the biological mother can provide emotional support.\n\n4. **Marital Status at Age 12:**\n   - The unknown marital status at age 12 is not directly relevant to adult criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, while there are some moderate risk factors present (employment stability and household size), the presence of a supportive family structure and lower recidivism rates for females suggest a lower overall risk. The confidence level reflects these mixed indicators.",
