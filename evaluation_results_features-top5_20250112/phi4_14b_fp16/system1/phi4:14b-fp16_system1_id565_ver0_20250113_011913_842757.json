The individual's demographic characteristics (female gender and being never married) are typically associated with lower risk levels in many studies. Additionally, having held two jobs suggests some level of stability and responsibility. While living with both biological parents at age 12 can be a protective factor, the household size of three does not inherently indicate high risk either. However, without more comprehensive data (e.g., criminal history, substance abuse), the confidence in this assessment is moderate.",
