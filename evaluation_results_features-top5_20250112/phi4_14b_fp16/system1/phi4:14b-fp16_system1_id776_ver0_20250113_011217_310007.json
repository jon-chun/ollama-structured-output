However, these factors are not strongly predictive without additional context.\n\n3. **Employment History**: Holding two jobs is generally seen as a positive factor, indicating some level of stability and responsibility.\n\n4. **Household Size**: A household size of 4 can suggest a stable family environment, depending on other dynamics.\n\n5. **Family Environment at Age 12**: Living with both biological parents typically indicates a potentially supportive family structure during formative years, which is generally considered a protective factor against risk behaviors.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWhile some factors like being male and never married might slightly increase risk, the presence of positive indicators such as employment history and a stable family environment at a young age suggest that overall risk is not high. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty due to the mixed nature of these factors.",
