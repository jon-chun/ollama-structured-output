Being male is often correlated with higher criminal activity rates compared to females. Never being married and not cohabiting can indicate a lack of stable social support, which is also linked to increased risk behaviors. Holding multiple jobs in a short time span may suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, potentially due to underlying issues like behavioral problems or substance abuse. A household size of 4 could imply economic strain depending on the family\u2019s income levels. Living with one's biological mother and having an unknown marital status at age 12 might indicate potential familial instability during formative years, which can contribute to risk factors later in life. However, without additional context or information about other mitigating circumstances (such as personal achievements, education level, etc.), the confidence is set at a moderate level of 70%.",
