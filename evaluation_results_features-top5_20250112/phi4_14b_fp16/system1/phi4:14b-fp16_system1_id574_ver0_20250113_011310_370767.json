However, being never married might correlate with higher risk in certain contexts, although this is less significant for females.\n\n2. **Cohabitation and Employment**: Not cohabiting and being unemployed are significant risk factors. Lack of stable relationships and employment can increase the likelihood of reoffending due to limited social support and economic instability.\n\n3. **Household Size**: A household size of 2 might suggest some level of social support, but without further details on the nature of these relationships, it\u2019s not definitive in reducing risk.\n\n4. **Family Environment at Age 12**: Lived with biological mother, but marital status unknown at age 12 could indicate potential instability or lack of a two-parent structure during formative years, which some studies link to higher risk outcomes.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment**: While the gender factor might mitigate risk slightly, unemployment and lack of cohabitation are strong indicators of increased risk. The historical family environment adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe confidence level reflects the complexity and interplay of these factors, acknowledging that while significant risks are present, individual circumstances can vary widely.",
