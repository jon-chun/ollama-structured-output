Additionally, living with biological parents at age 12 might suggest stable early childhood conditions, but the overall family dynamics and environment beyond this age are not specified.\n\n4. **Parental Presence**: The presence of another parent at age 12 could imply a supportive family structure during that period; however, without further context on the quality of relationships or changes over time, it is difficult to assess its impact fully.\n\nGiven these factors, there is a moderate level of confidence (75%) in predicting a higher risk based on common patterns observed in criminal justice assessments. However, the absence of additional contextual information limits the precision of this assessment.",
