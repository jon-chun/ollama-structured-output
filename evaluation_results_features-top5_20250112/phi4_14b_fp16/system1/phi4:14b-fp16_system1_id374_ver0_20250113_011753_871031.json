However, frequent job changes might also reflect instability, depending on the duration and reasons for leaving each job.\n\n4. **Household Size:** A household size of four is relatively typical and doesn't inherently suggest high or low risk without additional context regarding family dynamics.\n\n5. **Family Background:** Living with both biological parents at age 12 can be a protective factor, often associated with better outcomes in terms of stability and support during formative years.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall assessment leans towards lower risk, but there is some uncertainty due to potential instability indicated by employment history and marital status. Thus, a moderate confidence level is assigned.",
