If positive, it might mitigate risk; if negative, it could increase it.\n\n6. **Marital Status of Parents at Age 12:** Unknown marital status can imply instability during formative years, which is a potential risk factor.\n\nGiven these factors, there are several indicators that align with higher risk profiles, but the confidence level is not absolute due to missing contextual details and variability in individual circumstances.",
