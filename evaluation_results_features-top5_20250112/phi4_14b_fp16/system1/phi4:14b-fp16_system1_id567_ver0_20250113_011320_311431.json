This can be a moderate indicator of responsibility but doesn't strongly suggest high risk on its own.\n\n4. **Household Size and Family Dynamics**: A household size of 3 could indicate support systems through family presence, which often correlates with lower risk.\n\n5. **Living Arrangements with Biological Mother**: Living with the biological mother can imply a supportive environment, although it is unclear how this impacted the person during formative years due to the unknown marital status at age 12.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could be considered neutral or slightly positive in terms of risk (such as employment history and living arrangements), the presence of a spouse and being married generally suggest lower risk. Therefore, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk with moderate confidence.",
