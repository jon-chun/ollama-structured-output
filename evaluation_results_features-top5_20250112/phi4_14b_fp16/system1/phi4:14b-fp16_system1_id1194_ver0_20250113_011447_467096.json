Living with one's biological mother could imply single-parent dynamics, which some studies have linked with higher risk in certain contexts.\n\n4. **Marital Status Unknown at Age 12:** While less directly impactful than other factors, this can suggest potential instability or lack of information about early life circumstances, contributing to risk assessment complexity.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to the combination of these factors indicating moderate to high risk, but acknowledging that individual circumstances and additional context would further refine this assessment.",
