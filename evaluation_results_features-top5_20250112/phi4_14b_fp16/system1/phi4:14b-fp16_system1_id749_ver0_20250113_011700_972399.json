However, without additional information about family dynamics or socio-economic status during upbringing, it is not determinative.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests potential risk elements that warrant further evaluation but are not conclusive on their own. Therefore, the prediction indicates high risk with moderate confidence due to the presence of multiple concerning factors, though they are not definitive indicators without additional context.",
