Being never married or not cohabiting does not significantly elevate risk unless coupled with other negative factors.\n\n2. **Employment History**: Holding one job suggests some level of stability, although limited employment history can be a concern in assessing long-term stability and integration into society.\n\n3. **Household Size and Living Situation**: A household size of two is typical and living with a biological parent (mother) at an unspecified age could indicate familial support, which is often associated with lower risk.\n\n4. **Unknown Marital Status at Age 12**: While not directly indicative of current risk, it suggests limited information about early family environment stability, but without additional negative factors, this alone does not suggest high risk.\n\nOverall, these factors do not strongly indicate a high-risk profile, leading to a prediction of \"NO\" with moderate confidence.",
