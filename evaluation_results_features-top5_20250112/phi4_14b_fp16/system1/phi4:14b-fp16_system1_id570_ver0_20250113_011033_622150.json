Never being married can also be a factor, as studies have indicated that marital status is inversely related to recidivism.\n\n2. **Employment History:** Having held only one job might indicate instability or lack of commitment in the workforce, which could contribute to higher risk levels. Employment stability is often considered a protective factor against re-offending.\n\n3. **Household Size and Parental Living Situation at Age 12:** Living with both biological parents at age 12 generally suggests a potentially stable childhood environment, which might lower risk. However, this alone does not outweigh other factors indicating higher risk.\n\nThe combination of these factors leads to a prediction of \"YES\" for high risk, with moderate confidence due to the complexity and interplay of individual circumstances.",
