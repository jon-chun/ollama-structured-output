However, larger households can sometimes indicate economic strain.\n\n5. **Living Arrangements**: Having lived with the biological mother could be neutral or positive, depending on other factors like family dynamics and support.\n\n6. **Unknown Marital Status at Age 12**: This is not typically a direct risk factor but may suggest instability in early life experiences.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests potential for higher risk due to possible instability and lack of traditional social supports, though more specific context would be needed for a precise assessment. The confidence level reflects the general trends associated with these factors without additional detailed information.",
