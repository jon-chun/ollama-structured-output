Living with both biological parents at age 12 is generally considered positive; however, it does not mitigate other risk factors.\n\n4. **Statistical Correlation**: These factors combined have been statistically associated with higher risks in various studies, though the presence of both biological parents might reduce this slightly.\n\n5. **Confidence Level**: Given the mixed nature of these indicators (some protective, some risky), a moderate confidence level of 75 is assigned to reflect this balance.",
