Being male, never married, and not cohabiting can be associated with higher risks in some contexts, but holding one job suggests stability to an extent. A household size of four may imply a stable family environment during upbringing, which is generally positive. Living with both biological parents at age 12 often correlates with better outcomes, suggesting early life stability. Therefore, the overall risk is assessed as low based on these factors, though not negligible, leading to moderate confidence in this prediction.",
