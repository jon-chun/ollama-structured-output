Living with the biological mother alone may affect the development of certain social skills depending on context.\n\n4. **Marital Status Unknown at Age 12**: Uncertain parental stability during formative years can contribute to higher risk factors due to potential lack of guidance and structure.\n\nOverall, these factors combined suggest a moderate level of risk, but not definitive without further contextual information. Hence, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence of 75%.",
