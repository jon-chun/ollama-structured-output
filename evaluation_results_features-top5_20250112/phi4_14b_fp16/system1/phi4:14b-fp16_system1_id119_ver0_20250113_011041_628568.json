This is a recognized risk factor for higher criminal justice involvement.\n\n- **Marital Status and Cohabitation:** Being never married and not cohabiting can be associated with less social stability, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\n- **Employment History:** Holding only one job may suggest issues with employment stability. Employment instability is often linked to higher risk.\n\n- **Household Size and Early Environment:** A household size of four and living with both biological parents at age 12 can be neutral or protective, depending on the quality of family relationships and environment. However, without additional context, this factor alone does not strongly indicate high risk.\n\nOverall, while some factors suggest higher risk, others are less clear. The prediction is \"YES\" for high risk based on gender, marital status, and employment history, with a moderate level of confidence at 70%.",
