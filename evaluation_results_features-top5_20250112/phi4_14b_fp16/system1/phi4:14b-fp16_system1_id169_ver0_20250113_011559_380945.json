However, this is not definitive on its own.\n\n3. **Employment History**: Holding two jobs indicates some level of stability and responsibility in employment history, which generally lowers risk.\n\n4. **Household Size**: A household size of four suggests a potentially supportive family environment during formative years, which can be protective against future criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Family Structure at Age 12**: Living with both biological parents is often associated with lower risk as it typically indicates a stable upbringing and support system.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile some factors (e.g., male gender, lack of marriage/cohabitation) could suggest potential risks, the positive indicators such as employment stability and family structure during childhood outweigh these. Therefore, the overall assessment leans towards \"NO\" for high risk, with moderate confidence due to the balance of mitigating and risk-enhancing factors.",
