The individual's current unemployment and lack of cohabitation may contribute to financial stress, which is a known risk factor. Additionally, living in a household size of 4 without being the head of household could imply economic pressure. While these factors suggest increased risk, there is insufficient information about past behavior, criminal history, or social environment stability, hence the confidence level is not at maximum.",
