The individual's gender (female), marital status (divorced, not cohabiting), and employment history (held 2 jobs) generally indicate lower risk levels in various studies related to recidivism or general behavioral risk profiles. Additionally, having a household size of three and living with a biological mother may suggest a stable upbringing environment during formative years. The unknown marital status at age 12 is less likely to significantly impact current risk assessment as it pertains more to childhood than adulthood factors.\n\nWhile these indicators are generally associated with lower risk, the confidence level is set at 75 due to potential underlying issues not disclosed in the data provided, such as criminal history, mental health status, or substance use. These undisclosed factors can heavily influence risk assessments and must be considered for a comprehensive evaluation.",
