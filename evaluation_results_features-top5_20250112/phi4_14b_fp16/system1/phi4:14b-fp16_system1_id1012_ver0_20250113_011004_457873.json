Lived with biological mother; early family environment impacts are critical but less direct in adult risk assessment unless negative dynamics were involved.\n\n5. **Historical Marital Status Unknown at Age 12:** This is not typically a strong risk factor unless it suggests instability or neglect during formative years.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\n- The confidence level of 65 reflects the complexity and interplay of these factors, acknowledging that while several indicators suggest higher risk (unemployment, lack of social support), gender may mitigate some concerns. However, without more context-specific information, a definitive assessment cannot be made with high certainty.",
