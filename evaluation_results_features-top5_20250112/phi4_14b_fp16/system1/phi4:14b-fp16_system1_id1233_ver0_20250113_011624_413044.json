Living with their biological mother previously may indicate familial support during childhood.\n\n5. **Marital Status Unknown at Age 12**: This factor is neutral in terms of risk assessment as it doesn't directly correlate with future criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, while there are some indicators that could suggest potential risks (e.g., limited employment history), the presence of supportive relationships and lower gender-associated risk factors lead to a prediction of \"NO\" for high risk, but with moderate confidence due to incomplete information on certain aspects.",
