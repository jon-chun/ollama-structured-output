However, it does not directly correlate with high criminal behavior risk.\n\n- **Family Environment at Age 12**: Living with both biological parents during childhood is often associated with more stable upbringing environments, potentially reducing risk factors related to early familial instability.\n\nOverall, while some factors like employment history and household size could be concerning, they do not collectively indicate a high-risk profile in this context. The confidence level reflects the moderate certainty of this assessment given the available data.",
