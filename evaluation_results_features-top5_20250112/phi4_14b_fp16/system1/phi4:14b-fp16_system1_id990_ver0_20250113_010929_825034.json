This factor alone suggests a lower risk.\n\n- **Marital Status and Cohabitation:** Being never married and not cohabiting can be associated with higher risk in some contexts, but it is less predictive for females than for males.\n\n- **Employment History:** Holding two jobs indicates some level of stability and responsibility, which are positive indicators.\n\n- **Household Size and Family Structure:** Living with a biological mother and having a household size of 4 suggests a potentially supportive family environment. The marital status unknown at age 12 is not strongly indicative of risk without further context.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could be associated with higher risk (e.g., never married, not cohabiting), the presence of female gender and stable employment history weigh more heavily towards a lower risk assessment. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty given these mixed indicators.",
