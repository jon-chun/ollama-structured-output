Employment instability could be a concern, but without additional negative indicators, this alone isn't sufficient to suggest high risk.\n\n- **Household Size and Living Arrangements**: A household size of 4 with the presence of biological family members often provides a support system that can mitigate risk factors.\n\nOverall, while there are some aspects that might warrant closer observation (such as employment history), these factors do not collectively indicate a high level of risk. The confidence level reflects this assessment but acknowledges potential unknowns or additional context that could alter the analysis.",
