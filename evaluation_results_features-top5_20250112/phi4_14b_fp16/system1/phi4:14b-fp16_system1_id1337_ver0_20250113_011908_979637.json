Employment stability is a more significant factor.\n\n4. **Household Size**: A household size of four can suggest a supportive environment, which might mitigate some risks associated with being single or never married.\n\nOverall, while there are factors that could be considered moderate risk (e.g., marital status), the gender and potential for support from household members suggest a lower overall risk in this scenario. The confidence level reflects the variability and context-dependence of these factors.",
