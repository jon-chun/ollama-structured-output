Additionally, the presence of other parental figures at age 12 can be indicative of family disruption or absence of primary caregivers, factors that are associated with increased risk behaviors.\n\nWhile these indicators suggest a higher risk, it's important to note that they do not guarantee future behavior. The confidence level reflects the statistical correlations and trends observed in similar cases, but individual circumstances can vary significantly. Therefore, a 65% confidence level is assigned to reflect moderate certainty based on available data.",
