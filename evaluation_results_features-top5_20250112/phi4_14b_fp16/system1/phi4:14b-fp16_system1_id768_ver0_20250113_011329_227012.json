However, holding three jobs could also suggest adaptability and willingness to work, depending on the circumstances surrounding job changes (e.g., layoffs vs. voluntary resignations).\n\n4. **Household Size**: A household size of 6 may imply potential financial strain or support responsibilities, but it can also indicate strong family ties, which are generally protective against recidivism.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combination of these factors does not strongly suggest a high risk without additional information such as criminal history, substance use, or behavioral indicators. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the lack of comprehensive data typically required for a more definitive assessment.",
