Being male, never married, not cohabiting, having only one job, and a large household size are variables that have been statistically linked to increased risk of recidivism or antisocial behavior in various studies. However, the confidence level is set at 75 due to the complexity and variability of human behavior, which means other factors not included here could influence the final outcome.",
