Being male is often associated with higher risk, but other mitigating factors such as being married with a spouse present and having stable employment (holding one job) typically lower risk levels. A household size of 4 can indicate family responsibilities that may further reduce risk. The confidence level reflects this assessment's reliance on general patterns rather than specific predictive data for the individual in question.",
