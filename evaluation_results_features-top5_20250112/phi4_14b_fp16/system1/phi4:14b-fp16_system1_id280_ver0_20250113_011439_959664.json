Being male, never married, and not cohabiting are factors that can contribute to a higher risk profile in certain studies. However, the individual has held only one job, which might indicate instability but isn't necessarily predictive of high risk on its own.\n\nA household size of 4 is within normal ranges, suggesting a stable family environment during upbringing. Importantly, living with both biological parents at age 12 is generally associated with lower risk levels due to the potential for a supportive and structured home life during formative years.\n\nThe confidence level reflects that while some factors could suggest increased risk, others mitigate this, leading to an overall assessment of \"NO\" for high risk. The confidence score accounts for the mixed nature of these indicators and acknowledges that individual circumstances can vary significantly.",
