Never being married might also correlate with increased risk, as stable relationships can sometimes be protective against engaging in risky behavior.\n\n2. **Employment History**: Having held multiple jobs could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be linked to higher risk behaviors. However, it's not a definitive indicator without additional context regarding job duration and reasons for changes.\n\n3. **Household Size and Structure**: A larger household size of 4 may imply potential economic strain or other familial stressors that can contribute to higher risk factors. Living with the biological mother suggests some level of family support, but the unknown marital status at age 12 might indicate a lack of stable parental figures during formative years.\n\nOverall, while these factors do suggest potential for increased risk, they are not definitive on their own and should be considered in conjunction with other individualized information. The confidence is set at 65 due to the presence of multiple risk indicators but recognizing that more comprehensive data would enhance predictive accuracy.",
