However, the unknown marital status at age 12 may reflect potential family instability during formative years, which can be a risk factor.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest a moderate to high risk, but without more specific data (e.g., criminal history, substance use), the confidence is not absolute. Hence, a confidence level of 75 is chosen.",
