Being married with a spouse present and living in a household of two, coupled with the absence of group quarters at age 12, indicates a stable family environment. Holding two jobs suggests employment stability. However, biological parent status is unknown, which could potentially be an important factor if it's revealed to be significant. Nevertheless, based on the information given, I would predict no high-risk indicators and rate my confidence at 90%.",
