Being a male who is never married or cohabiting does not automatically mean high risk, as many factors contribute to an individual's risk profile. Having held one job and lived with biological parents suggests stability in early life, which could be a mitigating factor. The household size of 5 implies the presence of other family members, indicating support systems. However, without specific information about criminal history, substance abuse, mental health issues, employment history beyond this single job, or any legal convictions, it's difficult to definitively predict high risk. The age at which marital status was unknown does not inherently suggest high risk either. The confidence level is set moderately high (80) due to the lack of concrete indicators traditionally associated with high risk.",
