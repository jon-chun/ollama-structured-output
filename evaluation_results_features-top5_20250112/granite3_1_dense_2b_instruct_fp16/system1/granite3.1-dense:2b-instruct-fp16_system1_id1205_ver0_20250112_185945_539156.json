Being unemployed and living with biological parents are not typically associated with increased criminality. The age at which the individual was last with their marital status is irrelevant in determining current or future risk levels. There's no evidence of past involvement with the law, substance abuse, mental health issues, or other factors that might suggest a higher risk for criminal justice involvement.",
