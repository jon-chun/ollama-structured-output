Being a male with no known history of marriage or cohabitation, and having held two jobs while living with a biological parent, does not inherently indicate a high risk profile. Risk assessments typically consider factors such as past criminal convictions, substance abuse, mental health issues, employment instability, financial difficulties, and significant life stressors. The absence of these elements in this context suggests a lower potential for high-risk behavior.",
