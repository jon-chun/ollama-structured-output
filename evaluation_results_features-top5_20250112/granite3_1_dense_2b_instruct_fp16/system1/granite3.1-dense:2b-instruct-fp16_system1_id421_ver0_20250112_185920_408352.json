Gender: Being male does not inherently pose a higher risk.\n2. Marital Status: Never married or cohabiting doesn't automatically signify a higher risk; it depends on individual circumstances and behaviors.\n3. Employment History: Holding 2 jobs is a positive factor as it demonstrates reliability and work ethic, not necessarily high risk.\n4. Household Size: Living with both biological parents at age 12 suggests a stable home environment, which could be seen as a mitigating factor.\n\nOverall, these factors do not strongly suggest a high-risk profile; therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" and confidence level is 90%, indicating a moderate to low risk assessment.",
