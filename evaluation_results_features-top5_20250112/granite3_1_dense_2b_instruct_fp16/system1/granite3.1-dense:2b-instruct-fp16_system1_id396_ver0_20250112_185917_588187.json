Being a female, never married or cohabiting, and having held multiple jobs with a large household size does not directly correlate to increased criminal behavior or high-risk status. Additionally, the early age of 12 when the individual's marital status is unknown suggests that this may be an isolated incident rather than a pattern indicative of higher risk.",
