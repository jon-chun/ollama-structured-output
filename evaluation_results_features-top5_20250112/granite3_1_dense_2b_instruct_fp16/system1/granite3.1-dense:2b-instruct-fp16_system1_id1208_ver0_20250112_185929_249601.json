The individual's gender (male), lack of marriage, and living arrangements with their mother are common among various demographics. The number of jobs held (2) suggests stability in employment, which is often a positive indicator. The household size of 4 at age 12 does not correlate with criminal risk. Marital status being unknown at age 12 is also neutral and doesn't imply future high-risk behavior. Therefore, the confidence level for predicting high risk is relatively low (85 out of 100).",
