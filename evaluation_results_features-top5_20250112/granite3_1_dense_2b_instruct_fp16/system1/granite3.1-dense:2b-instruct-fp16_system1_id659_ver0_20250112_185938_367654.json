The individual is a female, which may influence some aspects of criminal behavior due to societal and biological differences, but does not inherently indicate high risk. Her employment history (1 job), household size (5), and living arrangements with her mother and other parent present at a young age suggest stability and support networks that are generally associated with lower risk. The absence of marriage or cohabitation, while potentially indicating fewer external responsibilities, does not automatically elevate risk. Overall, these factors do not point to a high-risk profile.",
