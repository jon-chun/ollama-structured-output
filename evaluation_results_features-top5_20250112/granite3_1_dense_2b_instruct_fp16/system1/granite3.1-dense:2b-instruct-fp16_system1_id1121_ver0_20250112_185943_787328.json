Being a male never married or cohabiting, being unemployed, and living with a household of size 5 (including other relatives) are common but not inherently high-risk indicators. The presence of an adult relative at age 12 suggests some family support, which could potentially mitigate risk. However, individual circumstances and past behaviors are crucial in determining actual risk level. This analysis is based on the provided information and does not account for other potential risk factors or contextual details.",
