The individual is a male, which does not directly influence the risk level in this context.\n2. Being never married and not cohabiting suggests a lack of long-term relationships or commitments, but does not automatically elevate risk.\n3. Holding two jobs indicates employability, which can be seen as a positive factor, not high risk.\n4. Living with biological parents at age 12 implies a stable family environment in his early life, reducing the likelihood of high-risk indicators.\n5. The marital status being unknown at age 12 does not signal any form of abuse or neglect that would typically lead to higher risk levels.\n\nThus, based on these factors, it can be predicted with a confidence level of 80% that the individual's risk level is not high.",
