Having held two jobs indicates employability and self-sufficiency. The large household size of 6 at one point may imply financial strain, but without further information about the income or economic situation, this factor is not conclusive for high risk. The absence of marital status known at age 12 does not necessarily indicate a history of high-risk behavior. Therefore, based on these factors, the predicted risk level is low (NO), with a confidence level of 95%.",
