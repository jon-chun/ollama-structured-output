Being female, unmarried, cohabitating, having held multiple jobs, living with extended family (parents), and a large household size are all common characteristics associated with different types of vulnerabilities rather than inherent high-risk behavior. They suggest a person who may be economically dependent or facing familial obligations but do not definitively imply criminal or delinquent behavior. A comprehensive risk assessment would require additional context, such as prior legal involvement, history of substance abuse, mental health issues, or patterns of antisocial behavior.",
