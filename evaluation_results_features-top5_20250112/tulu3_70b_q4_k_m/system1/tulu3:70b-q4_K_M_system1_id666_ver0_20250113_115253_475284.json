The confidence level is set to 65%, reflecting the uncertainty and potential variability in how these factors may influence an individual's propensity for criminal behavior.\n\nHere are some considerations based on each factor:\n\n1. **Male**: Historically, males have been shown to be more likely than females to engage in criminal activities.\n2. **Never Married/Not Cohabiting**: Single individuals without stable relationships might have less social support and fewer ties to conventional society, which could increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n3. **Unemployed**: Unemployment can lead to financial strain and a lack of structured daily activities, potentially increasing the temptation for criminal activity as a means to secure resources or occupy time.\n4. **Household Size of 4**: A larger household might indicate increased familial responsibilities or potential stressors, although it could also mean more social support within the home.\n5. **Lived with Both Biological Parents at Age 12**: This factor typically suggests a stable family environment during childhood, which generally correlates with lower risk for criminal behavior in adulthood.\n\nWhile these factors can contribute to an assessment of risk, they are not definitive predictors of future criminal behavior. Other important considerations include the individual's personal history (e.g., past criminal behavior), psychological profile, and situational factors that could influence their decision-making.",
