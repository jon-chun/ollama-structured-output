The individual's gender (female) and never-married status generally correspond with lower crime rates compared to males or individuals who are married but separated. Holding multiple jobs might suggest financial instability, which could be a minor risk factor; however, it also indicates adaptability and willingness to work. A household size of 2 is relatively small, suggesting fewer potential conflicts within the home environment.\n\nLiving with one's biological mother at age 12 is typical and does not inherently pose an increased risk. The absence of information about the marital status at age 12 could be seen as neutral rather than negative or positive in this context. Overall, while these factors might indicate some form of instability (e.g., job changes), they do not clearly point to a high risk for criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that risk assessments should involve more comprehensive data points, including individual behaviors, personal history with the law, and any known associations with criminal activity. Without those, one cannot definitively conclude high risk based solely on these factors.",
