Females generally have lower rates of offending compared to males. Additionally, the absence of a spouse or partner (never married, not cohabiting) may suggest more autonomy but is not directly correlated with higher criminal behavior.\n\nUnemployment can be associated with increased stress and potentially financial strain, which could indirectly increase the risk of criminal activity; however, it does not inherently indicate high risk on its own. A household size of 2 is fairly standard and doesn't provide a strong indicator either way.\n\nThe history of living with a biological mother at age 12 without knowing her marital status does not provide specific information about family dynamics or parenting quality that would significantly impact the risk assessment.\n\nTherefore, based on this data alone, there isn't sufficient evidence to predict high criminal justice risk. However, more comprehensive and context-specific factors (e.g., history of antisocial behavior, substance abuse, exposure to criminal environments) might shift this prediction. Given these limitations, my confidence in this prediction is 70%.",
