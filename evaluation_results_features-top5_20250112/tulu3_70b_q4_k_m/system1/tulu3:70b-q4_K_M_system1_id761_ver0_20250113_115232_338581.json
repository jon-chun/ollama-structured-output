While being a male and never married may suggest less social stability, these alone are not strong indicators of high risk. The person having held one job could imply employment stability or instability depending on additional context (duration, reason for leaving). A household size of 4 is typical and living with both biological parents at age 12 suggests a stable family environment during childhood.\n\nHowever, the confidence level is set at 60% because there are potential underlying factors not provided here that might elevate risk. For instance, details about educational background, neighborhood context, employment duration, job type, financial stability, criminal history, and peer influence could significantly alter this assessment. Without these additional data points, it's difficult to assert a definitive high-risk prediction.\n\nThe response above adheres strictly to the requested format and limitations.",
