He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month.
