However, this is not a strong indicator by itself.\n- **Drug Use History**: Using drugs in the past four years does not automatically increase risk; it may suggest underlying issues that need to be addressed through intervention.\n- **Depression History**: Not feeling depressed over the past month is generally healthy and indicates resilience, which could counterbalance potential risk factors. However, this alone is not a strong predictor of high-risk behavior.\n- **Family Background**: Growing up in an urban environment with both parents indicates stable living conditions but does not automatically increase his risk for criminal activities. The religion mentioned (God) might provide support or guidance but does not directly correlate with criminal activity.\n\nGiven these factors, the overall confidence level is moderate to low, indicating a \"NO\" prediction of high risk with a confidence score of 90% based on the available information.",
