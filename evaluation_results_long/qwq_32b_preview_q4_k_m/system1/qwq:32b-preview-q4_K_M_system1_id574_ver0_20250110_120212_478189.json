    "raw_message_text": "Okay, I need to analyze these risk factors and decide if they indicate high risk. I should respond only with a JSON object, no extra text.\n\nFirst, let's list out the factors:\n\n- Age: 21\n\n- Gender: Female\n\n- Race: White\n\n- Arrests: 1 time, no conviction\n\n- Height: 5'5\"\n\n- Weight: 135 lbs\n\n- Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\n- Education: High school diploma, enrolled in 4-year college\n\n- Employment: No jobs in the past year\n\n- Drug use: Marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\n\n- Depression: None in the past month\n\n- Childhood: Lived with biological mother in a household of 2 in an urban area\n\n- Religion: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nOkay, so I need to see if these factors suggest high risk. As a risk assessment expert, I know that different factors can indicate different levels of risk. Let's consider each one.\n\nStarting with demographic factors:\n\n- Age: 21 is relatively young, but not necessarily a high-risk age. Many people at this age are still establishing themselves.\n\n- Gender: Female. Generally, females have lower crime rates than males.\n\n- Race: White. In many studies, race isn't a significant factor once other variables are controlled.\n\n- Arrests: 1 arrest, no conviction. This is somewhat concerning, but since there was no conviction, it might not indicate persistent criminal behavior.\n\nNext, personal circumstances:\n\n- Living alone: Could be a risk factor, as lack of social support sometimes correlates with higher risk.\n\n- Education: Enrolled in college, which is positive. Education level is often inversely related to crime.\n\n- Employment: No jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, especially if it's prolonged.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor:\n\n- Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, particularly of illicit drugs like cocaine, can be associated with higher criminality.\n\n- However, it's been four years since use, which might indicate that she's moved beyond that phase.\n\nMental health:\n\n- No depression in the past month. This is positive, as mental health issues can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nChildhood factors:\n\n- Lived with biological mother in a small household in an urban area. Family structure can be a factor; single-parent households sometimes have higher risk profiles.\n\nReligious beliefs:\n\n- Believes God influences personal events. Some research suggests that strong religious beliefs can be protective against crime.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there are both positive and negative indicators.\n\nPositive factors:\n\n- Female gender\n\n- Enrolled in college\n\n- No current depression\n\n- Only one arrest with no conviction\n\nNegative factors:\n\n- Living alone\n\n- Unemployment for a year\n\n- History of drug use, including cocaine\n\nGiven that she has a history of drug use, particularly cocaine, which is a more serious drug, and combined with unemployment and living alone, these could be risk factors.\n\nHowever, her education level and current enrollment in college suggest positive engagement and potentially lower risk.\n\nAlso, the fact that she hasn't been convicted despite one arrest might indicate that the arrest wasn't for a serious offense or didn't lead to charges.\n\nMoreover, the drug use was in the past four years, but it's not specified how recent. If it's been a while since her last use, that could be positive.\n\nConsidering all this, I would lean towards a \"NO\" prediction for high risk, but with some reservations.\n\nI'd say prediction: \"NO\", confidence: 75.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\nBut maybe I should consider more deeply. Let's think about it again.\n\nIf she's enrolled in college, that suggests she's focused on her education, which is positive.\n\nUnemployment for one year could be because she's focusing on studies, especially if she's a full-time student.\n\nLiving alone might not necessarily be a risk factor; many people live alone without issues.\n\nThe drug use history is concerning, but again, if it was several years ago and she's not currently using, that might not be a active risk factor.\n\nNo conviction from the arrest suggests that it may have been a minor incident.\n\nReligious beliefs could be a protective factor.\n\nGiven all this, perhaps the risk is lower.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that drug use, especially cocaine, indicates potential for higher risk behavior.\n\nBut considering her current situation\u2014focused on education, no recent mental health issues, and seemingly stable\u2014I think \"NO\" with 75% confidence is appropriate.\n\n**Final Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
