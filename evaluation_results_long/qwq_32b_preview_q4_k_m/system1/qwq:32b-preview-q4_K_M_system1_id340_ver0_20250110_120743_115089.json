    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 21-year-old male identifying as Black. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's 21, which is young, but not necessarily a red flag on its own. Being male might be relevant since statistical data sometimes shows differences in criminal behavior based on gender, but again, it's just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nHe identifies as Black, which could be relevant due to systemic issues and biases in the justice system, but I need to approach this objectively based on the factors provided.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's something to consider. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean guilt, but it could indicate some level of involvement in activities that led to law enforcement attention.\n\nHis height and weight\u20146 feet tall and 165 lbs\u2014don't seem particularly noteworthy unless there's specific context suggesting otherwise.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can be relevant; some studies suggest that stable living arrangements might correlate with lower recidivism rates. But he's young, and living alone at 21 isn't unusual.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Education level is generally considered a protective factor against criminal behavior. So this is positive.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. That could be seen as unstable employment history, which might be a risk factor. However, it could also depend on the nature of these jobs and why he changed them.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is good. But recently, some days in the past month, he's felt down and nothing could cheer him up. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which might be relevant to his behavior and needs.\n\nHis childhood living situation: lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. Family structure can be a factor; living with both parents is often considered stabilizing.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally, which could indicate religious involvement, another potential protective factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, I need to make a prediction: yes or no for high risk, and provide a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nHmm. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nPositive factors:\n\n- High school diploma and enrolled in college.\n\n- No drug use in the past four years.\n\n- Lived with both parents during childhood.\n\n- Believes in God's influence in his life, possibly indicating religious involvement.\n\nNegative factors:\n\n- Arrested once, though not convicted.\n\n- Held three jobs in a year, suggesting possible employment instability.\n\n- Currently living alone, which might be neutral but could be a factor.\n\n- Recent feelings of depression or sadness.\n\nOverall, the positive factors seem to outweigh the negative ones. His educational pursuits and stable family background are strong protective factors. The arrest without conviction is concerning, but without more information on the nature of the arrest, it's hard to gauge its significance.\n\nThe employment history is a bit shaky, but again, he's young, and job-hopping can be common among\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba establishing their careers.\n\nThe mental health aspect is important. His recent feelings of sadness could indicate underlying issues that might affect his behavior or decision-making. This is something that should be monitored and possibly addressed through support services.\n\nGiven all this, my prediction is that he does not present a high risk. I'll give this a confidence level of 85%.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\{\"prediction\": \"NO\", \"confidence\": 85\\}} \\]",
