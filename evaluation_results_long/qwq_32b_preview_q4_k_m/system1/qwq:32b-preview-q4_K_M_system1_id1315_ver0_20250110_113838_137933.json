    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a criminal justice risk assessment. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as Black. Age and gender are known predictors in crime statistics, with young males generally having higher rates of offending. Race can also be a factor, but it's crucial to approach this sensitively and ensure that any considerations are based on empirical evidence and not stereotypes.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has convictions. That's a significant point. Prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of future risk. The justice system has already determined that he's committed offenses, which suggests a pattern of behavior that could continue.\n\nPhysical attributes: 6 feet tall, weighing 187 lbs. Not sure how much this matters in risk assessment. Maybe relevant in terms of potential for violence, but that's speculative. I'll set this aside for now.\n\nLives alone and has never been married. Family and social support structures can be important in rehabilitation. Living alone might suggest less supervision or fewer stabilizing influences, which could be a risk factor.\n\nEducational background: Has a GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often inversely related to crime rates. Lower education levels can correlate with higher criminality, possibly due to limited opportunities.\n\nEmployment: Held one job during the year. Employment history is crucial. Stable employment can be a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. However, holding only one job might not be sufficiently stable, depending on the job's duration and nature.\n\nSubstance use: No drug use in the past four years. That's positive. Substance abuse is closely linked with criminal behavior, so abstinence is a favorable sign.\n\nMental health: No depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so the absence of recent depression is another positive factor.\n\nBackground: Lived with biological father in a household of three in a rural area. Family structure and environment during upbringing can influence criminal tendencies. Living with both parents is generally considered more stable, but in this case, it was just the biological father and two others. Rural areas might have different social dynamics and opportunities compared to urban areas.\n\nReligious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events. Spirituality can be a protective factor, providing moral guidance and support.\n\nNow, synthesizing these factors:\n\n- Negative factors: Young age, male gender, racial identity (to be considered carefully), prior arrests and convictions, living alone, lower educational level, limited employment history.\n\n- Positive factors: No recent drug use, no recent depression, belief in God's influence in personal life.\n\nGiven that he has prior convictions, which is a substantial indicator of future risk, combined with young age and gender, these suggest a higher risk. However, the absence of recent substance use and mental health issues, along with his religious beliefs, could be mitigating factors.\n\nBut in risk assessment, prior convictions carry significant weight. The fact that he's been convicted before suggests a propensity for criminal behavior.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is that this individual represents a high risk.\n\nConfidence: I'd say 85%. The prior convictions and young age are strong indicators, but the positive factors like no drug use and stable employment to some extent temper this assessment.\n\n**Final JSON Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
