    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to analyze these risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I'll approach this step by step, considering each factor and how it might relate to criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male identifying as Black. Age and gender are known factors in crime rates, with young males generally having higher rates of offending. Race can also be a factor, but it's important to handle this sensitively and ensure that any considerations are based on statistical trends rather than stereotypes.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. This is a significant red flag. A history of arrests and convictions suggests a pattern of antisocial behavior and potential disregard for the law.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'8\" and between 150-174 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight don't typically correlate directly with risk levels, so I'll consider this neutral.\n\nLiving alone and never married. Living situation can be a factor; some research suggests that stable living arrangements and social supports can reduce recidivism. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nEducation: High school diploma, not enrolled in college. Education level can influence employment opportunities and overall life prospects, which in turn can affect criminal behavior. Not being enrolled in college might suggest limited future prospects, potentially increasing risk.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job during the year. Employment history is crucial. Having only one job in a year could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down some of the time in the past month. Substance use and mental health issues are significant predictors of criminal behavior and recidivism. Marijuana use, while illegal in many places, is common among young adults, but combined with depressive symptoms, it could indicate underlying issues.\n\nEarly life: Lived with adoptive parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Family background and upbringing can influence behavioral outcomes. Being adopted might suggest some disruption in early life, which could be a risk factor.\n\nAttitude towards religion: Considers God has nothing to do with personal events. Spiritual or religious beliefs can provide coping mechanisms and moral guidance, so a lack of religiosity might indicate fewer protective factors.\n\nOverall, several of these factors point towards higher risk:\n\n- Young male age\n\n- Multiple arrests and convictions\n\n- Living alone with potential limited social support\n\n- Limited education and employment history\n\n- Substance use and possible mental health issues\n\n- Early life factors like adoption\n\nHowever, some factors are neutral or unclear in their relationship to risk.\n\nGiven the prevalence of negative risk factors, particularly the history of arrests and convictions, combined with indicators of potential instability in living situation, employment, and mental health, I would predict high risk.\n\nBut I need to be cautious. Not all individuals with these characteristics will reoffend, and there may be unknown protective factors present.\n\nConsidering the balance of factors, my prediction is \"YES\" for high risk, with a confidence level of around 85%.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
