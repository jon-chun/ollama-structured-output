    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 21-year-old male identified as White. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's 21, which is young, and males in this age group can sometimes be more impulsive and prone to risky behaviors. His ethnicity might play a role, but I need to be careful not to stereotype based on that alone.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. That's something to consider. Arrests don't necessarily mean he's guilty of anything, but it does suggest that there have been suspicions or allegations against him that were serious enough for law enforcement to get involved.\n\nHis physical attributes: 5'10\" and 195 lbs. Not sure how relevant this is directly to risk assessment, unless perhaps in terms of potential for certain types of crimes involving physical force.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a factor if it means he lacks social supports, which might increase the risk of certain behaviors. But again, many people live alone without any issues.\n\nEducational background: He has a GED, which is good, but he's not enrolled in college. Lack of higher education or vocational training could potentially limit his employment opportunities, which might be a risk factor if he's not engaged in productive activities.\n\nEmployment history: He hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor for involvement in crime, as it can lead to frustration, boredom, and a lack of structure.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major red flag in risk assessments. Both drugs have their own associated risks, but cocaine is particularly concerning due to its higher potential for addiction and the criminal activities often associated with its use and distribution.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's positive. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, so the fact that he's not reporting depression is a plus.\n\nHis childhood background: He lived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Large households can sometimes mean less individual attention, which might have an impact. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which could influence his environment and experiences.\n\nOverall, several factors here point towards a higher risk: the arrests, lack of employment, drug use history, and living alone without apparent social supports. However, his educational attainment and current absence of depression are positive aspects.\n\nGiven all this, I would predict that this individual represents a high risk, but I'm not entirely certain, as some factors are mitigating. So, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level around 75%.\n\nBut since the instruction is to provide only the JSON object, here it is:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",
