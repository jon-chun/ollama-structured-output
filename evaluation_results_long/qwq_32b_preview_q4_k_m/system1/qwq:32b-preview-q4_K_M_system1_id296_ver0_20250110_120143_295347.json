    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's dive into this risk assessment. I've got a lot of data points here, and I need to determine if this individual poses a high risk based on these factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the person is a 21-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are significant factors in criminal behavior statistics. Young males are statistically more likely to be involved in crime, especially violent crimes. So, this ticks a couple of boxes for higher risk.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has convictions. That's a clear indicator of past criminal behavior. The justice system has already deemed him guilty of some offenses, which suggests a propensity for breaking the law. This is a substantial red flag.\n\nHis physical attributes: 5'11\" and weighing between 150-174 lbs. Not sure how much this directly correlates to risk, but it's good to note. Maybe relevant in certain types of crimes that require physicality, but generally, I don't place too much weight on this.\n\nLives alone and has never been married. Family and social connections can be crucial in assessing someone's stability and support system. Living alone without a marital bond might indicate less social accountability, which could be a risk factor.\n\nEducational background: no high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Education level is a significant predictor of future employment and overall stability. Lower education levels are often linked with higher crime rates, as opportunities may be more limited.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs in the past year. On one hand, this could suggest responsibility and a willingness to work. On the other hand, it might indicate financial struggles or instability, which could correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nDrug use: has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and some days in the past month has felt very down. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for criminal behavior. Both legal and illegal drug use can impair judgment and lead to involvement in criminal activities, either to sustain the habit or as a result of impaired decision-making.\n\nEarly life: lived with his biological dad in a household of three in an urban area. Family structure can be indicative; growing up without both parents can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors. However, he did live with his biological father, which is somewhat stable.\n\nReligious belief: believes God has something to do with personal events. Spirituality can be a protective factor for some individuals, providing a moral compass and support system. However, it's not always conclusive, as people with strong beliefs can still engage in criminal behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, let's weigh them:\n\n- Demographics: young male, white \u2013 slightly higher risk statistically.\n\n- Criminal history: arrests and convictions \u2013 high risk.\n\n- Living situation: alone, never married \u2013 moderate risk.\n\n- Education: no high school diploma or GED \u2013 high risk.\n\n- Employment: two jobs, but low education \u2013 mixed, possibly high risk due to financial pressures.\n\n- Substance abuse: drug use and depression symptoms \u2013 very high risk.\n\n- Early life: single-parent household \u2013 moderate risk.\n\n- Religious belief: believes in God's influence \u2013 potentially protective, but unclear.\n\nOverall, the presence of multiple risk factors, particularly criminal history, substance abuse, and educational deficiencies, strongly suggest a high risk. The only somewhat mitigating factor is his religious belief, but given the severity of other indicators, it's likely not enough to offset the risks.\n\nI would predict high risk with a confidence level of around 85%. There's always uncertainty, but based on standard risk assessment models, this profile aligns closely with higher-risk individuals.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
