    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 21-year-old female. Let's see what we're dealing with here.\n\nFirst off, she's identified as Black. Race shouldn't be a factor in determining criminal risk; it's important to approach this objectively without letting bias influence the assessment.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's something to consider. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean she's guilty, but it does suggest that there was suspicion of criminal activity.\n\nHer physical attributes: 5'3\" and 230 lbs. Physical characteristics might be relevant in certain contexts, like the type of crimes she could be involved in, but generally, they don't directly indicate risk.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can be a factor; some studies suggest that stable relationships and living arrangements can reduce recidivism rates. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college and hasn't held a job in the past year. Employment history is crucial. Unemployment can be linked to higher criminal activity due to lack of structure and financial stability.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years, and some days in the past month she's been feeling down. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors. Marijuana use could indicate potential for other drug-related offenses, and her mood suggests possible depression or other mental health concerns.\n\nBackground: lived with her biological mother in a household of six in a rural area. Family structure and environment can influence criminal behavior. Larger households might have less supervision per child, which could be a risk factor.\n\nLastly, she says God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. Spiritual beliefs or lack thereof aren't typically direct indicators of criminal risk, but they might reflect broader attitudes towards authority and society.\n\nOverall, several red flags here: arrest history, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, and living alone without apparent support systems. These factors collectively suggest a\u8f83\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u8c03\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u53ea\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e00\u6982\u800c\u8bba\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4eba\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u90fd\u662f\u72ec\u7279\u7684\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u6765\u505a\u51fa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u3002\n\n\u9274\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u201c\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u201d\uff0c\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5ea6\u7ea6\u4e3a80%\u3002\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```\n",
