    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess. Let's see what we're dealing with here. So, the person in question is a 21-year-old female, mixed race. She's been arrested twice and has convictions. She's married, living with her spouse, but doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Only held one job in the past year, which might not be stable employment. Drug use is a big red flag\u2014she's used cocaine in the last four years and has been feeling really down lately. Also, her childhood was in an urban area with her bio mom and two others.\n\nFirst off, age is a factor. Twenty-one is still pretty young, and people at this age might still be figuring things out, but two arrests and convictions suggest a pattern that's concerning. Being married and living with her spouse could be positive, showing some stability, but without a high school diploma or GED, her educational level is low, which could limit job opportunities.\n\nOnly having one job in the past year might indicate instability in employment, which is a risk factor. Drug use, especially cocaine, is a major issue. Not only is it illegal, but it can lead to addictive behaviors and other negative consequences. The fact that she's been feeling down all the time could suggest depression or other mental health issues, which, if not addressed, can contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nHer background\u2014growing up in an urban area with her biological mother and two others\u2014doesn't provide a lot of information on its own, but urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates or more access to drugs, which might have influenced her environment.\n\nOverall, considering the arrests, convictions, drug use, mental health issues, and educational shortcomings, I would predict this person is at high risk for further criminal activity. My confidence in this prediction is quite high, maybe around 85%.\n\nSo, in the required format:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year.
