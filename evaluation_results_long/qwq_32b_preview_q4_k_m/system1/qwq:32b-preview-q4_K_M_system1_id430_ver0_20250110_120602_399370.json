    "raw_message_text": "I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and decide if they indicate high risk. I need to give my answer in a specific JSON format, with a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 22-year-old white female who's been arrested once but not convicted. She's 5'9\" and weighs 160 lbs, divorced, not living alone, has a GED, not in college, had one job in the past year, no drug use in four years, but has been feeling really down lately. Also, she grew up in a household of three people and doesn't believe God affects personal events.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what these factors might indicate in terms of risk. Since I'm a risk assessment expert, I should think about recidivism risk or perhaps the risk of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior. But the prompt doesn't specify exactly what kind of risk we're assessing, so I'll assume it's related to criminal justice outcomes.\n\nLet's break down the factors:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: 22-year-old female. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males, and younger ages might indicate higher impulsivity but also greater potential for rehabilitation.\n\n2. **Race**: Identifies as White. Race can be a factor in risk assessments, but it's important to handle this sensitively and ensure that any considerations are based on statistical trends rather than stereotypes.\n\n3. **Arrest and Conviction History**: Arrested once but not convicted. This suggests some involvement with the justice system but no formal finding of guilt.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: Divorced at 22. This might indicate relationship issues or early maturity challenges.\n\n5. **Living Situation**: Not living alone. This could be positive, suggesting social support.\n\n6. **Education**: Has a GED, not enrolled in college. GED is equivalent to a high school diploma, so education level is moderate.\n\n7. **Employment**: Held one job in the past year. Stability in employment is generally positive, but holding only one job might indicate limited work history.\n\n8. **Drug Use**: No drug use in four years. This is a positive sign, showing abstinence from substances.\n\n9. **Mental Health**: Feeling down most of the time for the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which can affect behavior and decision-making.\n\n10. **Upbringing**: Lived in a household of three people. Not sure if this is relevant unless it indicates household dynamics.\n\n11. **Spirituality**: Believes God has nothing to do with personal events. Spirituality can be a support system for some, but lack thereof isn't necessarily a risk factor.\n\nConsidering these factors, the person seems to have a mix of positive and negative indicators. The absence of convictions, no recent drug use, and stable employment are positive signs. However, the arrest history, divorce at a young age, and current mental health struggles could be cause for concern.\n\nIn criminal justice risk assessments, mental health is a significant factor. Untreated mental illness can increase the likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behaviors. The person's feelings of being down and unable to be cheered up suggest possible depression, which needs attention.\n\nGiven all this, I would lean towards indicating a higher risk due to the mental health concerns, despite the positive aspects like stable employment and no recent drug use.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 70.\n\nHere's how I'll format it:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\nI choose 70 because while there are significant risk factors, especially the mental health issue, there are also stabilizing elements like employment and absence of drug use. So, it's not a full 100% certainty, but still a notable risk.\n\n",
