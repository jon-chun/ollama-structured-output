    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to assess risk based on some given factors. I need to look at all these details and decide if this person is high risk or not, and then give a confidence level for my prediction. Let's see.\n\nFirst off, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Age and gender can be factors in crime statistics, but I have to be careful not to stereotype. It's just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests don't necessarily mean guilt, but it does suggest some level of involvement with the law. Maybe he was in the wrong place at the wrong time both times, or perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 188 lbs. Physical attributes might be relevant in certain contexts, but I don't see a direct link here to risk assessment.\n\nLiving alone without any formal education beyond high school and no job in a year suggests some instability in his life. Education and employment are often indicators of stability and can influence one's path. Lack thereof could indicate higher risk.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana in the past four years\u2014could be a concern, especially if it's frequent or if it's leading to other risky behaviors. However, marijuana is less potent than other drugs, and its use alone might not be a strong indicator.\n\nNo depression in the past month is positive. Mental health plays a significant role in behavior, and absence of depression could mean he's emotionally stable.\n\nHis childhood: lived with his biological dad in a household of two. Family structure can be a factor; single-parent households sometimes correlate with higher risk, but again, it's not definitive.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with personal events. Spirituality can be a positive influence, providing guidance and support.\n\nNow, compiling all this information: arrests without convictions, lack of education and employment, living alone, drug use, stable mental health, single-parent upbringing, and spiritual beliefs.\n\nI need to make a prediction: yes or no for high risk, and a confidence level.\n\nConsidering the arrests, lack of education and job, and drug use, there are several red flags here. However, the stability in mental health and his spiritual beliefs might be mitigating factors.\n\nBut overall, the negatives seem to outweigh the positives in this scenario. So, I'm going to predict yes, high risk, but with a confidence level that reflects the mixed picture.\n\nLet's say 70%. That gives some room for the positive aspects of his situation.\n\nSo, my JSON response will be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\{\"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 70\\}} \\]",
