    "raw_message_text": "I'm analyzing the provided risk factors to assess whether they indicate high risk, likely referring to recidivism or future criminal behavior. I'll consider each factor and weigh its significance based on known research and statistical relationships in criminal justice.\n\n**Age:** 19 years old. Research shows that younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities, particularly violent crimes. However, as they age, this propensity generally decreases. So, being 19 is a moderate risk factor.\n\n**Gender:** Male. Males are statistically more likely to commit crimes than females, especially violent crimes. This is a significant risk factor.\n\n**Race/Ethnicity:** White. In many studies, race can be a factor, but its impact varies widely depending on the context and jurisdiction. Without specific local data, it's hard to assign a strong weight to this factor.\n\n**Arrest and Conviction History:** Arrested 2 times and has been convicted. A history of arrests and convictions is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior. This is a high-risk factor.\n\n**Physical Attributes:** Height 5'11\" and weight 168 lbs. Physical attributes generally have little bearing on recidivism risk unless specific to certain types of crimes.\n\n**Marital Status:** Never married and living alone. Unmarried status and living alone can sometimes indicate higher risk due to lack of stabilizing relationships, but this varies.\n\n**Education:** Has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism rates. However, having a GED is better than no high school diploma, so this is a moderate risk factor.\n\n**Employment:** No jobs held during the year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as stable employment can be protective.\n\n**Substance Use:** Used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, including marijuana, can be associated with higher criminal behavior, though the strength of this relationship varies.\n\n**Mental Health:** Has not felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can be risk factors, but the absence of recent depression may be protective.\n\n**Family Background:** Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Stable family structures are generally protective against criminal behavior. Living with both parents is positive, but urban areas may have higher crime rates, which could have environmental influences.\n\n**Religious Beliefs:** Considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing moral guidance and support.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\n- High-risk factors: Multiple arrests and convictions, being male, unemployment.\n  \n- Moderate-risk factors: Young age, lower educational level, substance use.\n  \n- Protective factors: Living with both parents during upbringing, having a GED, not currently depressed, spiritual beliefs.\n\nGiven the presence of multiple high-risk factors, particularly the arrest and conviction history and unemployment, coupled with some moderate risks like young age and substance use, but also considering some protective factors, I would predict a higher risk of future criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, the protective factors do mitigate the overall risk to some extent. Therefore, while the prediction is leaning towards high risk, the confidence is not absolute due to the presence of these positive elements.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\nThis indicates a high-risk assessment with a confidence level of 75%, recognizing the mix of risk and protective factors present in this individual's profile.\n",
