    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and decide if they indicate high risk. I need to give my prediction as \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a confidence level between 0 and 100 in a JSON format. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male, identifies as White. Age and gender are often considered in risk assessments, especially in criminal justice contexts. Being young and male tends to be associated with higher risk, statistically speaking. But I have to look at all the factors together.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's interesting. An arrest without conviction could suggest some level of involvement in problematic behavior, but without a conviction, it's harder to confirm the severity or truth of the charges.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 204 lbs. Physical attributes might be relevant in certain assessments, perhaps related to physical altercations or ability to commit certain types of crimes, but this seems somewhat peripheral unless there's specific context.\n\nNever been married and not living alone. Relationship status and living situation can be indicators. Stability in relationships and living arrangements is sometimes associated with lower risk, so not being married and not living alone might slightly increase risk factors.\n\nHas a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is important. A GED suggests he completed high school equivalency, which is good, but not being enrolled in college might be seen as lacking in current educational or career focus, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. That seems like high job turnover, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, potentially a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially of illicit substances like cocaine, is a significant risk factor. It can indicate involvement in illegal activities and possible addiction issues, both of which are relevant to criminal behavior.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is crucial. Lack of depression might be seen as positive, but it depends on the overall context.\n\nEarly life: lived with biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Family structure and environment can be indicative. Living in a large household might suggest potential for limited parental supervision, which could be a risk factor.\n\nReligious belief: considers God has nothing to do with personal events. Spiritual or religious beliefs can influence behavior and support systems, but this is subjective and varies widely.\n\nConsidering all these factors, let's weigh them:\n\n- Age and gender: slightly higher risk.\n\n- Arrest but no conviction: some concern, but not definitive.\n\n- Physical attributes: neutral to slightly relevant.\n\n- Relationship and living situation: possibly higher risk due to lack of stability.\n\n- Education: GED is positive, but not in college might be a minus.\n\n- Job turnover: high, which is a risk factor.\n\n- Drug use: significant, especially cocaine.\n\n- No depression recently: potentially positive, but context-dependent.\n\n- Early family environment: large household, possible supervision issues.\n\n- Religious views: uncertain impact.\n\nOverall, the drug use, particularly cocaine, and the high job turnover are substantial red flags. Combined with the arrest history and living situation, it seems like there are multiple indicators pointing towards higher risk.\n\nI would predict \"YES\" for high risk, with a confidence level of around 85%. The drug use and employment instability are strong factors, and while some aspects like lack of recent depression and having a GED are positive, they may not outweigh the negatives in this case.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\nI need to make sure to stick to the required format and not include any extra explanations. But for my own understanding, it's clear that the combination of drug use, employment issues, and arrest history tips the scale towards high risk.\n\n",
