    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this risk assessment to do. Let's see, the person is a 22-year-old white female, arrested twice but no convictions yet. She's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs., which might be something to consider in terms of physicality, but I don't know how that directly correlates to risk. She's never been married, not living alone, has a high school diploma, and isn't in college right now. Only held one job in the past year, so maybe employment stability could be an issue. No drug use in the last four years, which is positive, and no depression in the past month, that's good too. Growing up, she lived with both bio parents in a household of six, and she believes God plays a role in personal matters.\n\nFirst off, age is a factor; 22 is still relatively young, and people at this age might be more impulsive or lack maturity compared to older individuals. Being white might or might not be relevant, depending on the context, but I'll keep that in mind. She's been arrested twice without convictions, which could suggest that those arrests didn't lead to charges or she was found not guilty. Either way, it shows some involvement with the law, even if not resulting in convictions.\n\nHer weight might be pertinent if it affects her behavior or how others perceive her, but I'm not sure about that. Not being married and not living alone are neutral points, maybe. Education level\u2014high school diploma but not in college\u2014could indicate lower educational attainment, which sometimes correlates with higher risk, but it's not a definitive factor.\n\nHolding only one job in a year might suggest instability, but it could also mean she's been steadily employed. I need to clarify that. Says she has held one job during the year, so maybe she has been consistently employed, which is positive.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a strong point in her favor, as substance abuse can often lead to criminal behavior. No depression recently is also good, as mental health issues can sometimes correlate with risk.\n\nHer family background\u2014living with both parents in a larger household\u2014might suggest a stable upbringing, which is generally positive. Her religious belief could indicate a moral compass or community support, which might lower risk.\n\nOverall, considering these factors, I would lean towards a \"NO\" for high risk. The lack of convictions, no recent drug use or depression, and seemingly stable employment suggest\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c arrest history\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u9274\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709 conviction\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5979\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5bfc\u81f4\u72af\u7f6a\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7efc\u5408\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u6211\u8ba4\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u4e0d\u9ad8\u3002\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
