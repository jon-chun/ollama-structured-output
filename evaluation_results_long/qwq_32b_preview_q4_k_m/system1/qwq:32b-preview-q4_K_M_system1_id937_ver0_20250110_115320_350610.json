    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess. Let's see, the subject is a 19-year-old female, white, arrested twice, convicted, height 5'6\", weight 125-149 lbs, married, living with spouse, no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, held one job in the past year. Drug use: marijuana and cocaine in the last four years, and lately, she's been feeling really down, like nothing can cheer her up. Childhood: lived with bio mom in a rural area, household size four, and she believes God influences personal events.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to consider the risk factors here. Being 19, female, white\u2014those are baseline demographics. Two arrests, convicted\u2014that's a significant mark. The conviction suggests a more serious offense or at least one that led to adjudication. Her educational level is low; no high school diploma or GED, and not in college. Employment: only one job in the past year\u2014that could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\n\nDrug use is a big red flag. Marijuana and cocaine are both illicit substances, and recent use suggests possible addiction or at least ongoing abuse. The mental health aspect is also concerning\u2014feeling persistently down could indicate depression, which might be comorbid with substance use disorder.\n\nBackground: lived in a rural area in a household of four. Not much to go on there, but growing up in a rural area might limit opportunities and exposure to certain risks.\n\nReligious belief: she thinks God influences personal events. That could be positive if it provides support or negative if it leads to undue stress or conflict.\n\nLet me think about this step by step. The conviction is a major risk factor. Depending on the nature of the crime, it could indicate a propensity for further illegal activity. At 19, there's still room for rehabilitation, but the combination of drug use, mental health issues, and limited education makes the outlook challenging.\n\nMarried and living with spouse\u2014that could be supportive if the marriage is stable and the spouse is positive influence. On the other hand, if the spouse has similar issues, it might not be helpful.\n\nEmployment history is sparse\u2014only one job in the past year. That could suggest difficulties in the workplace or maintaining employment, which is another risk factor.\n\nSo, synthesizing all this, I would say the risk is high. The combination of a criminal conviction, drug use, mental health issues, limited education, and unstable employment history are strong indicators of future risky behavior.\n\nBut I need to be careful. Age is young, and there might be potential for change, especially if she receives appropriate support and intervention.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider the confidence level. Given all these factors, I'd say my confidence is quite high that this indicates a high risk.\n\nLet me check if there are any mitigating factors. She's married, which could be supportive. But overall, the negatives outweigh the positives here.\n\nSo, my prediction is YES, indicating high risk, with a confidence level of, say, 85%.\n\nWait, maybe higher. Given the drug use, mental health issues, and criminal history, I'm going to bump that up to 90%.\n\nYeah, 90% confidence that this profile indicates high risk.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```\n",
