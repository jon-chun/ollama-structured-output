    "raw_message_text": "To analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk, I will consider various aspects such as criminal history, personal circumstances, education level, employment status, substance abuse, mental health indicators, and family background. Each of these factors can contribute to an individual's likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behaviors.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Criminal History:**\n   - Arrested 1 time and has been convicted.\n     - Having a criminal record indicates some level of past delinquency.\n\n2. **Personal Circumstances:**\n   - Age: 21 years old.\n     - Young adults may still be developing mature decision-making skills.\n   - Gender: Female.\n     - Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\n   - Race: Identifies as Black.\n     - Racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, which may impact assessment.\n\n3. **Living Situation:**\n   - Living alone.\n     - Lack of social support can be a risk factor.\n   - Never married.\n     - Marital status can influence stability, but it's not always indicative.\n\n4. **Education and Employment:**\n   - No high school diploma or GED.\n     - Lower education levels are associated with higher crime rates.\n   - Not enrolled in college.\n     - Lack of educational engagement may indicate limited prospects.\n   - Held no jobs during the year.\n     - Unemployment can lead to idle time and potential involvement in criminal activities.\n\n5. **Substance Abuse:**\n   - Used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years.\n     - Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior.\n   - Recent drug use indicated by feelings of being down.\n\n6. **Mental Health:**\n   - Feelings of depression (\"so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up\") some of the time during the past month.\n     - Mental health issues can contribute to risky behaviors.\n\n7. **Family Background:**\n   - Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area.\n     - Family structure and environment can influence behavior.\n   - Spiritual beliefs: Considers God has something to do with personal events.\n     - Spirituality can provide support or conversely, be a factor in certain behaviors.\n\n### Risk Assessment:\n\nGiven the combination of factors such as criminal history, lack of education and employment, substance abuse, mental health issues, and living alone without immediate social support, there are significant indicators suggesting high risk. However, the individual's gender and spiritual beliefs might mitigate some risks.\n\n### Prediction:\n\nBased on the analysis above, the prediction is that this individual presents a high risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
