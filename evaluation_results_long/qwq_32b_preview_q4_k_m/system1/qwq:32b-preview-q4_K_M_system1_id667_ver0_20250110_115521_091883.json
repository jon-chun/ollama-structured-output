    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 20-year-old female. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, she's White, 20 years old, height 5'1\", weight 110 lbs. So physical attributes don't really scream high risk on their own, but let's keep that in mind.\n\nShe's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a notable mark against her. Criminal history is a significant factor in risk assessment. The fact that she's been convicted means she's already been through the judicial system and found guilty of something. That carries weight.\n\nMarital status: never married, not living alone. Educational background: high school diploma, enrolled in a 2-year college. Employment: held three jobs in the past year. So, education seems stable, but job instability could be a concern. Frequent job changes might indicate difficulty maintaining employment or impulsivity.\n\nDrug use: she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently, within the past month, she's been feeling down, to the point where nothing could cheer her up. This suggests possible depression or other mental health issues, which can be related to higher risk behaviors, including substance abuse and potential for reoffending.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. That seems relatively stable, but perhaps not directly relevant to current risk assessment.\n\nHer belief about God's influence on her personal life might indicate her moral or spiritual compass, but that's more subjective and harder to quantify in terms of risk.\n\nSo, synthesizing all this:\n\n- Criminal history: convicted offense \u2013 high-risk factor.\n\n- Employment instability: three jobs in a year \u2013 possible impulsivity or inability to maintain consistent work, which could be a risk factor.\n\n- Substance abuse: recent use of illicit drugs, especially cocaine, which is more dangerous and addictive \u2013 significant risk.\n\n- Mental health: recent feelings of depression \u2013 could impair judgment and increase risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\n- Education: enrolled in college, which is positive, but needs to be weighed against the other factors.\n\nOverall, the criminal history, substance abuse, and mental health issues are substantial red flags. The employment instability also adds to the concern.\n\nI would predict high risk in this case.\n\nPrediction: YES\n\nConfidence: 85\n\nSo, my JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
