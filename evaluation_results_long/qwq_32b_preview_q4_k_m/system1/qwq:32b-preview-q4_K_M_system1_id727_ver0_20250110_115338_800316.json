    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's dive into this risk assessment. I've got a bunch of factors here about this 19-year-old male, and I need to decide if these indicate high risk. First off, he's white, which might or might not be relevant depending on the context, but race isn't typically a predictive factor in risk assessments beyond perhaps certain environmental influences.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted, which is interesting. An arrest without conviction could suggest that the legal system didn't find sufficient evidence for a conviction, or maybe it was a misunderstanding. Either way, it's a mark on his record, but it's not as severe as a conviction.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 185 lbs. Hmm, that's a bit above average weight for his height, but without knowing his build, it's hard to say if that's significant. Maybe he's muscular, or perhaps he has some weight issues. Again, not directly related to risk unless there are specific circumstances where weight is a factor.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could be a sign of independence, but it could also indicate isolation, which might be a risk factor depending on the context. Not having a high school diploma or GED is definitely a red flag. Education level is often correlated with future opportunities and can be an indicator of potential involvement in criminal activities if alternatives are limited.\n\nOnly holding two jobs in a year might suggest instability in employment, which could be a risk factor. Frequent job changes or inability to hold a job can sometimes indicate underlying issues that might lead to higher risk behavior.\n\nDrug use\u2014specifically marijuana\u2014in the past four years is another consideration. Marijuana is a controlled substance, and its use can sometimes be associated with other risky behaviors or legal troubles, even if it's becoming more accepted in some regions.\n\nNo depression in the past month is positive; mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, so the absence of depression is a plus.\n\nHis childhood living situation: living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Family structure can be significant; single-parent households might face more challenges, which could influence risk levels.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with personal events. Spirituality can be a protective factor for some individuals, providing them with a moral compass and support systems.\n\nNow, compiling all these factors: arrest but no conviction, living alone, no high school diploma, unstable employment, drug use, no depression, single-parent household in urban area, and spiritual beliefs.\n\nGiven that, I would predict that this individual presents a higher risk due to the combination of lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use history. However, the absence of a conviction and no recent depression might slightly mitigate that risk.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence of 75%.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
