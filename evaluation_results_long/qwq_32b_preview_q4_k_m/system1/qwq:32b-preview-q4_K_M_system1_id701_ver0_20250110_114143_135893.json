    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a criminal justice risk assessment. Let's see what I can make out of this.\n\nFirst off, the person is a 20-year-old female identifying as White. Age and gender can be factors in certain types of crimes, but generally, females are less likely to reoffend compared to males. Race could be a factor in some models, but it's important to approach that with caution and ensure it's not introducing bias.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting. An arrest without conviction might suggest that the evidence wasn't strong enough for conviction, or perhaps it was a misunderstanding. Either way, it's still an arrest record, which could indicate some level of involvement in criminal activity, even if not proven in court.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and between 150-174 lbs. Physical attributes like these don't typically correlate directly with recidivism rates as far as I know, so I'll set this aside for now.\n\nNever been married and living alone. Marital status can sometimes be a factor; married individuals might have lower recidivism rates because of stable relationships and support systems. However, this isn't always the case, and living alone doesn't necessarily mean she lacks social support.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level is important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. Not being in college could be a risk factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nHeld four jobs in a year. That seems like high job instability, which can be a risk factor. Frequent job changes might indicate difficulty maintaining employment or other underlying issues that could relate to higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHistory of marijuana use in the past four years. Substance use is a significant risk factor. Even if it's just marijuana, which is less severe than harder drugs, any drug use can indicate potential for engaging in other risky behaviors.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's positive. Mental health issues like depression can be linked to higher recidivism, so not experiencing depression could be a protective factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household with both biological parents in a rural area, and considering God has nothing to do with personal events. Family structure can be a factor; growing up with both parents is generally seen as positive. However, her view on religion might suggest a lack of involvement in religious communities, which could sometimes provide support and reduce recidivism.\n\nOverall, there are several risk factors here: arrest history, job instability, substance use, and not being enrolled in higher education. These are all indicators that could point towards a higher risk of reoffending. However, there are also some protective factors, like never having been convicted, not experiencing depression, and having grown up with both parents.\n\nGiven this mix, I would predict that this individual is at higher risk, but the confidence isn't extremely high because of the presence of both risk and protective factors.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n\n",
