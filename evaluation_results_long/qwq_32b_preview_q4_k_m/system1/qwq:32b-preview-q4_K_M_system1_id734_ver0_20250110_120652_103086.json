    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a criminal justice risk assessment. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, the individual is a 21-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are known predictors in crime statistics, with young males historically having higher rates of involvement in criminal activities. So, that ticks a couple of boxes right there.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has convictions. That's a pretty significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of behavior that doesn't comply with legal standards, which is a major risk factor for future offenses.\n\nHis physical attributes: 5'10\" and 215 lbs. Not sure how much weight this carries in risk assessments, but perhaps it could be relevant in certain contexts, like the ability to commit certain types of crimes.\n\nLives alone and has never been married. Family and social support systems are important protective factors against criminal behavior. Living alone might suggest a lack of such supports, which could increase risk.\n\nEducational background: high school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. That's somewhat positive, as education is often inversely related to crime rates. However, the fact that he hasn't held any jobs in the past year is concerning. Employment is another protective factor, and unemployment can be linked to higher criminal tendencies.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years, and some recent depressive symptoms. Substance abuse and mental health issues are both strong risk factors for criminal behavior. They can impair judgment, lead to poor decision-making, and sometimes drive individuals to commit crimes to support their habits or cope with emotional pain.\n\nLastly, he comes from a large household of six and doesn't believe God influences personal events. I'm not entirely sure how to weigh these factors. Maybe growing up in a larger family could indicate certain environmental stresses, but that's speculative. The religious belief (or lack thereof) is probably not directly relevant to risk assessment.\n\nOverall, considering the multiple arrests, convictions, living situation, lack of employment, substance use, and mental health indicators, it seems like this individual poses a\u8f83\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669 for future criminal behavior.\n\nBut I need to be careful here. Each of these factors needs to be considered in context, and there might be mitigating circumstances not present in this data. However, based solely on the information provided, my prediction is that this person is at high risk.\n\nNow, for confidence. Given the number of risk factors present and their historical correlations with recidivism, I'd say I'm fairly confident in this assessment. Maybe around 85% confidence.\n\nBut wait, I should remember that risk assessments are not exact sciences, and there's always room for error and rehabilitation. So perhaps adjusting the confidence slightly downward to account for that uncertainty.\n\nLet's go with 80% confidence.\n\nSo, my response should be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 80\n\n}\n\nYes, that seems appropriate.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{\\text{",
