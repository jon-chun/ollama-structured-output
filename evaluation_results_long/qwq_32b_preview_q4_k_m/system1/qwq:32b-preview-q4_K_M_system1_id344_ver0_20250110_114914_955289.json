    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a criminal justice risk assessment. Let's see what we're dealing with here.\n\nFirst off, the individual is a 20-year-old female identifying as White. Age and gender can be relevant; younger individuals might be more impulsive, but being female generally correlates with lower crime rates. So, maybe this leans slightly towards lower risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's interesting. An arrest without conviction could suggest a false alarm or insufficient evidence, which might not indicate high risk. However, it could also mean that she was involved in some questionable activities.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'0\" and 180 lbs. Physical attributes might not directly correlate with risk, unless there are specific contexts where size matters, like in certain types of crimes.\n\nNever been married and living alone. Living situation can be a factor; some studies suggest that stable relationships and community ties can lower recidivism rates. So, living alone might be a minor risk factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level is important; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates. Not being in college could be a neutral or slightly risky factor, depending on other circumstances.\n\nHeld nine jobs in a year. That's a red flag. High job instability can indicate impulsivity, inability to maintain employment, or other underlying issues that might correlate with higher criminal risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recent depression symptoms. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors. Cocaine is particularly concerning due to its association with more serious criminal activities.\n\nEarly family environment: lived with both biological parents in a rural area in a household of five. Family structure can be a protective factor; living with both parents often correlates with lower risk. However, the specific dynamics within the household aren't known, so it's hard to gauge fully.\n\nReligious belief: considers God has some influence on personal events. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing moral guidance and support.\n\nOverall, considering these factors, the substance abuse, recent drug use, mental health symptoms, and extreme job instability are significant red flags. Despite some protective factors like living with both parents during upbringing and identifying as religious, the current behaviors and circumstances suggest a higher risk.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES,\" indicating high risk, with a confidence level of around 85%.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n{  \n\"prediction\": \"YES\",  \n\"confidence\": 85  \n}  \n",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 9 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
