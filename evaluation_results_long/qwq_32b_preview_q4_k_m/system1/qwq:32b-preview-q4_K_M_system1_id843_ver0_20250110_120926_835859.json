    "raw_message_text": "Okay, I need to analyze these risk factors and decide if they indicate high risk. I should respond only with a JSON object, no extra text.\n\nFirst, let's list out the factors:\n\n- Age: 19\n\n- Gender: Male\n\n- Race: White\n\n- Arrests: 8 times\n\n- Convicted: Yes\n\n- Height: 5'10\"\n\n- Weight: 150-174 lbs\n\n- Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\n- Education: High school diploma, not in college\n\n- Employment: Held 2 jobs in the year\n\n- Drug use: Marijuana and cocaine in past four years, some days in past month\n\n- Mental health: Feels down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up\n\n- Family background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 6\n\n- Religious belief: God has nothing to do with personal events\n\nOkay, let's consider each factor and see how they might relate to risk.\n\nStarting with demographic factors:\n\n- Age: 19 is typically considered a higher-risk age because of impulsivity and lack of maturity.\n\n- Gender: Male, which statistically has higher crime rates than female.\n\n- Race: White \u2013 in some studies, race can be a factor, but it's important to approach this cautiously and ensure that biases aren't influencing the assessment.\n\nNext, criminal history:\n\n- 8 arrests and convicted: This is a significant number of arrests and a conviction indicates a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\nThen, physical characteristics:\n\n- Height and weight: Don't seem directly relevant to risk, unless there are specific contexts where size matters.\n\nLiving situation:\n\n- Living alone, never married: Some research suggests that stable relationships can reduce recidivism, so living alone might be a risk factor.\n\nEducation and employment:\n\n- High school diploma, held 2 jobs in a year: Employment is generally positive, but frequent job changes could be a negative.\n\nDrug use:\n\n- History of marijuana and cocaine use, recent drug use: Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior.\n\nMental health:\n\n- Feeling down, nothing can cheer him up: This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nFamily background:\n\n- Lived with both biological parents in a household of 6: Generally, stable family environments are positive, but large households might have their challenges.\n\nReligious belief:\n\n- Believes God has nothing to do with personal events: Religious involvement can sometimes be protective, so lack thereof might be neutral or a slight risk factor.\n\nNow, synthesizing these factors:\n\n- Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n- Drug use, especially recent use, is a significant risk factor.\n\n- Feeling persistently down suggests possible mental health issues, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\n- Living alone and never married might lack social supports that could help prevent recidivism.\n\n- Employment history shows some stability but also job changes, which could indicate instability.\n\nGiven all this, the overall picture seems to suggest a high risk. The criminal history, drug use, mental health issues, and living situation all point towards higher risk.\n\nI need to provide a confidence level between 0 and 100. Considering the substantial number of risk factors, especially the criminal history and recent drug use, I would rate my confidence fairly high.\n\nPerhaps around 85%.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\nBut I should double-check if there are any protective factors that might lower the risk.\n\nLooking back, living with both biological parents in a stable environment could be positive. Also, having employment history shows some ability to hold down jobs.\n\nHowever, these positive factors are outweighed by the significant negative factors, particularly the extensive criminal history and current drug use.\n\nTherefore, my final assessment remains that this individual presents a high risk, with 85% confidence.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",

He has been arrested 8 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
