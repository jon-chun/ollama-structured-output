    "raw_message_text": "Okay, so I've got this scenario here, and I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. I have to respond with a JSON object that says either \"YES\" or \"NO\" for the prediction and a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst off, let's look at the person's demographics. He's a 21-year-old white male. Age is a factor because younger individuals might be more impulsive and have higher risk tendencies. Being male also tends to correlate with higher crime rates, although that's not always the case.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has convictions. That's a significant red flag. Prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of future criminal behavior. It shows a pattern of breaking the law.\n\nHis physical attributes: 5'10\" and 160 lbs. Not sure how much that matters in risk assessment, but it's noted.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because there might be less social accountability.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not enrolled in college. Education level can be indicative; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates.\n\nEmployment: held one job during the year. Employment stability is important. Holding only one job might not be bad, but it depends on the context.\n\nDrug use: has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially harder drugs like cocaine, is a major risk factor. It can lead to involvement in criminal activities to support the habit or due to impaired judgment under the influence.\n\nMental health: hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's a positive, but history of mental health issues could be relevant, though not mentioned here.\n\nBackground: lived with both biological parents in a rural area in a household of three. Family structure can be a factor; living with both parents is generally considered stable, which might be a protective factor.\n\nReligious belief: believes God has something to do with personal events. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing moral guidance and support.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors:\n\n- Prior arrests and convictions: high risk\n\n- Drug use, especially cocaine: high risk\n\n- Age and gender: somewhat risky\n\n- Living alone: moderate risk\n\n- Education level: not necessarily low, but not higher education\n\n- Employment: only one job, could be stable, but depends\n\n- No recent depression: positive\n\n- Stable family background: protective factor\n\n- Belief in God: potentially protective\n\nOverall, the prior convictions and drug use, particularly cocaine, are major concerns. Despite some protective factors like living with both parents and not currently experiencing depression, the criminal history and substance abuse suggest a high risk of future offending.\n\nI would predict \"YES\" for high risk with a confidence level of, say, 85%.\n\nSo, my JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",
