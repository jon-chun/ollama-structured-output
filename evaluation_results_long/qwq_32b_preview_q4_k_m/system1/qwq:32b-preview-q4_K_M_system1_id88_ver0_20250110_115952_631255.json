    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task here to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 19-year-old white male with a bunch of arrests and convictions. Let's see.\n\nFirst off, he's 19, which is pretty young. In criminal justice, age can be a factor because younger people tend to be more impulsive and have higher rates of crime, especially property crimes and some violent offenses. But as they age, these tendencies usually decrease. So, being 19 might suggest some level of risk, but it's not entirely clear without more context.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has convictions. That's a pretty significant number. Frequent arrests and convictions are strong indicators of recidivism. Research shows that individuals with multiple prior convictions are more likely to reoffend. So, this is a major red flag.\n\nHis demographic information: white male, living alone, no high school diploma or GED, only held one job in the year. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because lack of social support might make it harder to stay on track. Not having a high school diploma or GED can limit employment opportunities, which is another risk factor for criminal behavior. Employment stability is crucial; holding only one job in a year might indicate instability.\n\nDrug use: he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, particularly illicit drugs like cocaine, is linked to higher rates of crime. Substance abuse can both cause criminal behavior and be a consequence of it, creating a vicious cycle.\n\nNo history of depression in the past month is actually a positive point. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, so not experiencing depression might be seen as slightly lower risk in that regard.\n\nHis background: lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Family structure can be a factor; living with both parents is often considered more stable, but since he was with his biological mother, it's not necessarily negative, especially if the home environment was supportive.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens personally, which might indicate some level of spirituality. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can be protective against criminal behavior, but it's not a guarantee.\n\nOverall, considering the multiple arrests and convictions, lack of education, unstable employment, drug use, and living alone, I would predict high risk. The positive points are his age (starting to mature), no current depression, and possible religious beliefs, but these might not outweigh the negatives.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" for high risk, with a confidence level of, say, 85%. That seems reasonable given the factors.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I should consider that he's 19 and might still be maturing. But with 10 arrests and convictions, it's hard to ignore that pattern. Also, the drug use is a significant issue. So, yes, I'll stick with \"YES\" and 85% confidence.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
