    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to assess risk based on these factors. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst off, the person is an 18-year-old male, mixed race. Age is a big factor; 18 is still pretty young, and statistically, younger individuals might be more prone to certain risks. Being male also tends to correlate with higher risk in some studies, but that's a generalization.\n\nHe's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a significant mark against him. A history of criminal behavior is a strong indicator of future risk. So that's a big red flag.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'11\" and 230 lbs. Physically, he's large. Not sure how that directly correlates to risk, but it might be relevant in certain contexts, like physical altercations.\n\nLives alone, never been married. Social connections can be a protective factor; lacking them might indicate higher risk. But he's young, so maybe he just hasn't had the opportunity yet.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education level is a known risk factor. Lower education often correlates with higher crime rates.\n\nNo jobs held in the past year. Employment is another protective factor; unemployment can lead to higher risk behaviors.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor. Cocaine is particularly concerning due to its association with more serious criminal activity.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's actually a positive, but maybe not relevant to all types of risk.\n\nGrew up in a household of six. Larger households might have their challenges, but it's hard to generalize.\n\nViews God as having no personal influence. Spiritual beliefs are subjective and may or may not relate to risk, depending on the context.\n\nSo, synthesizing all this:\n\n- Criminal history: High risk\n\n- Education level: High risk\n\n- Employment: High risk\n\n- Drug use: High risk\n\n- Living situation: Moderate risk\n\n- Age: Some risk, but young age can be mitigated by other factors\n\nOverall, it seems like there are multiple significant risk factors present here. The criminal history and drug use are particularly concerning. However, the lack of depression and his age might be slightly mitigating, but probably not enough to outweigh the other factors.\n\nI need to make a prediction in the format specified: {\"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\", \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100}\n\nGiven the preponderance of risk factors, I'm going to predict \"YES,\" indicating high risk. As for confidence, I'd say 85%. There's always a chance for change and rehabilitation, but based on these factors, it seems likely that this individual poses a higher risk.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
