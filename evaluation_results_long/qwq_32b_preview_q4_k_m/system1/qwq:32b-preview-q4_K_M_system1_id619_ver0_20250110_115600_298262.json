    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's see here. I've got this scenario to assess risk based on these factors. First off, the person is an 18-year-old male, Hispanic, arrested once, convicted, height 5'6\", weight 160 lbs, never married, living alone, enrolled in school, no jobs in the past year, drug use history including marijuana and cocaine, no depression in the last month, lived with bio mom in a household of 4 in an urban area, and believes God influences personal events.\n\nOkay, so starting with demographics: male, age 18, Hispanic. Statistically, young males are often associated with higher crime rates, but that's a broad generalization. Ethnicity can also play a role, but it's not the deciding factor by itself.\n\nArrest and conviction history: arrested once and convicted. This suggests some level of involvement in criminal activity, which is a significant risk factor. The fact that there's a conviction indicates that the legal system has determined guilt, which weighs heavily in risk assessment.\n\nPhysical attributes: height and weight seem average for his age, so nothing stands out there.\n\nMarital status and living situation: never married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because lack of social support might lead to higher-risk behaviors.\n\nEducation: enrolled in school, which is positive. Educational engagement often correlates with lower crime rates.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, as it may lead to frustration and involvement in criminal activities.\n\nDrug use: history of marijuana and cocaine use in the past four years. Drug use, especially harder substances like cocaine, is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior and recidivism.\n\nMental health: no depression in the last month. That's positive, as mental health issues can complicate risk levels.\n\nBackground: lived with biological mother in an urban area in a household of four. Family structure can be a factor; single-parent households sometimes correlate with higher risk, but again, it's not definitive.\n\nBelief in God's influence: this might suggest some level of spiritual or moral framework, which could be positive.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors:\n\n- Conviction history: high risk\n\n- Drug use, especially cocaine: high risk\n\n- Unemployment: moderate risk\n\n- Living alone: mild risk\n\n- Enrolled in school: positive\n\n- No depression: positive\n\n- Belief in God's influence: potentially positive\n\nOverall, the conviction history and drug use, particularly cocaine, are major red flags. Despite being enrolled in school and not currently depressed, the combination of a conviction and substance abuse history suggests a\u8f83\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669.\n\nI'd predict high risk, with perhaps 85% confidence.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
