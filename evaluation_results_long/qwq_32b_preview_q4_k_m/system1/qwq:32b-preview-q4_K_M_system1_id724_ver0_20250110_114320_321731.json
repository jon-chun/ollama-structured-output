    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's dive into this risk assessment. I've got a lot of data points here, and I need to determine if this person presents a high risk based on these factors. First off, the individual is a 21-year-old white male. Age is a significant factor; young adults are often more prone to risky behaviors. Being male also tips the scale somewhat, as statistically, males are more likely to be involved in criminal activities than females.\n\nNow, he's been arrested eight times and has convictions. That's a pretty substantial history. Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that doesn't comply with the law. Convictions confirm that these behaviors have led to judicial sanctions. This is a major red flag in any risk assessment.\n\nHe's 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 pounds. Physical attributes might not directly indicate risk, but they can be relevant in certain contexts, like the types of crimes he might be involved in. However, without more specific information, I'll consider this neutral for now.\n\nLiving alone and never having been married could suggest a lack of stable social connections, which is sometimes linked to higher risk behaviors. Social support systems are important for rehabilitation and staying on the right path.\n\nEducational background: He has a GED, which is better than no high school diploma, but it's not equivalent to a standard high school diploma. Not being enrolled in college might indicate a lower level of educational attainment, which can correlate with higher crime rates.\n\nEmployment history: Holding two jobs in a year suggests some level of employment, which is positive. Stable employment is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. However, the frequency of job changes could be a concern if it indicates instability.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it contributes to criminal behavior or indicates a pattern of rule-breaking.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is good. Mental health issues can sometimes lead to behavioral problems, so the absence of recent depression is positive.\n\nFamily background: Lived with his biological dad in a household of four. Family structure can be influential; living with both parents is often associated with better outcomes, but this varies widely.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God has nothing to do with personal events. Spiritual or religious beliefs can provide a moral compass and support system, so a lack thereof might indicate fewer constraints against criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, the arrest and conviction history is the most compelling indicator of high risk. Combined with the young age, male gender, and some socioeconomic factors like education and employment stability, it suggests a\u8f83\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4f46\u6211\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4ed4\u7ec6\u5730\u6743\u8861\u6240\u6709\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\nLet me consider each factor's weight:\n\n1. **Arrest and Conviction History**: High impact. Multiple arrests and convictions strongly suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n2. **Age and Gender**: Moderate impact. Being a young male increases risk statistically, but this is a generalization.\n\n3. **Living Situation**: Mild impact. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\n4. **Education**: Mild to moderate impact. GED is better than no diploma, but lower than a standard high school degree.\n\n5. **Employment**: Mixed impact. Holding jobs shows some work ethic, but frequent job changes could be\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\n\n6. **Drug Use**: Moderate impact. Marijuana use can be associated with other risky behaviors.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: Mild positive impact. No recent depression is favorable.\n\n8. **Family Background**: Mild impact. Living with biological dad might provide some stability, depending on the relationship quality.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Mild to moderate impact. Lack of religious involvement might mean fewer moral constraints.\n\nGiven all this, the arrest and conviction history overwhelmingly suggests high risk. The other factors mostly support this assessment, with few positives like current mental health and some employment history.\n\nI need to make a prediction in the specified JSON format. Based on the analysis, I conclude that the prediction is \"YES\" for high risk, with a confidence level of 90%.\n\nSo, the JSON response will be:\n\n{\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 90\n\n}\n\n",
    "normalized_prediction": "YES"
