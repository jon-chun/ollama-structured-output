    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 19-year-old male identified as White. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a notable mark against him. Typically, any criminal record is a red flag, especially at such a young age. The fact that it's only once might be slightly mitigating, but still, having a conviction suggests some level of involvement in unlawful activities.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 190 lbs. Physical attributes alone don't necessarily indicate risk, but in combination with other factors, they might be relevant. For instance, someone of this build might be perceived as more threatening in certain situations.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes be a risk factor, as it may indicate a lack of social support or stability. However, many people live alone without any issues, so it's not conclusive by itself.\n\nEducational background: high school diploma and enrolled in a 4-year college. That's positive. Educational attainment is often inversely related to criminal behavior, so this is a plus.\n\nEmployment history: held two jobs during the year. Stability in employment is generally good, but holding multiple jobs could indicate financial pressures, which might be a stressor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common among young adults, and while it's illegal in many places, its association with criminal behavior varies. Some studies suggest that marijuana use is not strongly linked to violent crime, for example.\n\nNo depression in the past month is positive. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in a rural area during upbringing. Stable family environments are generally protective factors against delinquency.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God has something to do with personal events. Spiritual or religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and support system, which might deter risky behavior.\n\nNow, let's weigh these factors. The conviction is a significant negative. However, his educational pursuits and current employment suggest responsibility and a path toward stability. Living alone could be a neutral factor, depending on other circumstances.\n\nDrug use history adds some risk, but marijuana is relatively less impairing compared to harder substances. No recent depression is good.\n\nHis family background seems stable, which is positive, and his religious beliefs might provide additional moral guidance.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present, particularly the conviction and drug use, the protective factors like education, employment, and stable upbringing somewhat mitigate these risks.\n\nGiven all this, my prediction is that he is not at high risk, but I'd rate my confidence at about 75%. There's still some uncertainty, especially regarding the conviction and drug use history.\n\nSo, in JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\n\"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
