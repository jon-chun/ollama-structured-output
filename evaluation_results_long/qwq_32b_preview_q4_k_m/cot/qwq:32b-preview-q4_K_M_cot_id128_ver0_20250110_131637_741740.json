    "raw_message_text": "Okay, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and consider each factor one by one, assigning a relative weight of low, medium, or high based on its potential impact on recidivism.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male identified as White. Age and gender are known risk factors in criminal justice research. Young males are generally at higher risk for recidivism due to various social and biological factors. So, I'll consider age and gender together as a single factor.\n\n**Factor: Age and Gender**\n\n- **Weight:** High\n\n- **Reasoning:** Research consistently shows that young adult males have higher rates of recidivism compared to other demographic groups. The combination of being young and male is a strong predictor.\n\nNext, the individual has been arrested once and has a conviction. This indicates some level of involvement in criminal activity.\n\n**Factor: Prior Arrests and Convictions**\n\n- **Weight:** Medium\n\n- **Reasoning:** Having a prior arrest and conviction suggests that the individual has engaged in criminal behavior in the past. However, with only one arrest and conviction, it's not a extensive criminal history, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight are generally not considered significant risk factors for recidivism. So, I won't assign much weight to this factor.\n\n**Factor: Physical Attributes**\n\n- **Weight:** Low\n\n- **Reasoning:** There is no established link between height and weight and the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nThe individual has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence recidivism rates. Being unmarried and living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\n**Factor: Marital Status and Living Situation**\n\n- **Weight:** Medium\n\n- **Reasoning:** Studies suggest that marital status and having a stable living environment can provide support and structure that may reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Living alone without being married could indicate less social support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level is an important factor in recidivism risk. Higher education is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\n**Factor: Education Level**\n\n- **Weight:** Low\n\n- **Reasoning:** Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests a commitment to education, which is positive. However, since he's only enrolled in a 2-year college, it's not as strong as completing a higher degree, so I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment history can be crucial. Holding multiple jobs might indicate instability or could suggest a proactive approach to finding employment.\n\n**Factor: Employment History**\n\n- **Weight:** Medium\n\n- **Reasoning:** The number of jobs held in a year could reflect job stability. Frequent job changes might indicate difficulties maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor. However, holding two jobs could also mean he is working hard to support himself, which is positive.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, but has not felt depressed over the past month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as it can lead to criminal behavior and relapse.\n\n**Factor: Substance Abuse**\n\n- **Weight:** High\n\n- **Reasoning:** Use of illicit drugs, especially harder substances like cocaine, is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates. Even if he hasn't felt depressed recently, substance abuse remains a major concern.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size four in an urban area during his childhood. Family environment and upbringing can influence criminal behavior later in life.\n\n**Factor: Childhood Home Environment**\n\n- **Weight:** Medium\n\n- **Reasoning:** Living with both parents generally provides a more stable environment, which is positive. However, the specific dynamics within the household aren't known, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective factors against recidivism, providing moral guidance and support.\n\n**Factor: Religious Beliefs**\n\n- **Weight:** Low\n\n- **Reasoning:** While religious affiliation can provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending, it's not a strong predictor on its own. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nNow, let's compile these factors to make a prediction about his 3-year rearrest recidivism risk.\n\nLooking at the weights:\n\n- High: Age and Gender, Substance Abuse\n\n- Medium: Prior Arrests and Convictions, Marital Status and Living Situation, Childhood Home Environment\n\n- Low: Physical Attributes, Education Level, Religious Beliefs\n\nConsidering that there are two high-risk factors and three medium-risk factors, with only low-risk factors providing positive influence, it seems likely that the risk of recidivism is\u8f83\u9ad8.\n\nHowever, he is enrolled in college, which suggests some level of commitment to personal development, and he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. But the substance abuse history is a significant concern.\n\nGiven this balance, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n**Prediction:** YES\n\n**Confidence:** 75\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age and Gender\", \"high\", \"Young adult male, high risk demographic\"),\n\n(\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some criminal history\"),\n\n(\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not linked to recidivism\"),\n\n(\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone may indicate less social support\"),\n\n(\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in college, positive but not strong\"),\n\n(\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs in a year, could indicate instability\"),\n\n(\"Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"History of drug use, including cocaine, high risk\"),\n\n(\"Childhood Home Environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in urban area, unknown dynamics\"),\n\n(\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences personal events, potentially protective but not strong\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",
