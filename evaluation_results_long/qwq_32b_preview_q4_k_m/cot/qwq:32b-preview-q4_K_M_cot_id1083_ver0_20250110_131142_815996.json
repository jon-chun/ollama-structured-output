    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period based on various factors provided. I'll evaluate each factor, assign a relative weight of low, medium, or high based on its impact on recidivism, and then make a prediction.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old\n\n2. Gender: Male\n\n3. Race: Black\n\n4. Arrest history: Arrested 2 times, convicted\n\n5. Physical attributes: 5'11\" tall, weight between 200-224 lbs\n\n6. Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\n7. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n\n8. Employment: Held no jobs during the year\n\n9. Drug use: Used marijuana in the past four years\n\n10. Mental health: Not depressed over the past month\n\n11. Household size during upbringing: Lived in a household of 11 people\n\n12. Religious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nOkay, now I need to consider how each of these factors typically relates to recidivism rates.\n\nStarting with age:\n\n- Age 21: Research shows that younger ages are often associated with higher recidivism rates, as impulsive behavior and lack of maturity can lead to reoffending. So, I'll mark this as a high-risk factor.\n\nNext, gender:\n\n- Male: Males generally have higher recidivism rates than females. So, this is another high-risk factor.\n\nRace:\n\n- Black: There are disparities in the criminal justice system, and being black can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to systemic issues, but it's important to approach this sensitively. I'll consider this a medium-risk factor, acknowledging that societal factors may play a role.\n\nArrest and conviction history:\n\n- Arrested 2 times, convicted: A history of arrests and convictions is a strong predictor of future offending. This should be a high-risk factor.\n\nPhysical attributes:\n\n- Height and weight: These are generally not directly related to recidivism. So, I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nMarital status:\n\n- Never married, living alone: Stability in personal relationships can be protective against reoffending. Living alone might indicate less social support. I'll consider this a medium-risk factor.\n\nEducation:\n\n- No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college: Low education levels are linked to higher recidivism rates due to limited job opportunities. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nEmployment:\n\n- Held no jobs during the year: Unemployment can lead to idle time and fewer positive influences, increasing the risk of reoffending. This is another high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use:\n\n- Used marijuana in the past four years: Substance use, including marijuana, can be associated with higher recidivism due to potential dependency and legal issues. I'll mark this as medium risk.\n\nMental health:\n\n- Not depressed over the past month: Lack of depression might be a positive sign, but mental health overall is complex. Since there's no indication of current mental health issues, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHousehold size during upbringing:\n\n- Lived in a household of 11 people: Growing up in a large household could indicate potential overcrowding and less individual attention, which might be a risk factor. I'll mark this as medium risk.\n\nReligious belief:\n\n- Believes God has something to do with personal events: Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a supportive framework and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. However, this is subjective and varies widely. I'll consider this a low-risk factor, assuming that the belief provides some positive influence.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- High risk: Age, gender, arrest/conviction history, education, employment\n\n- Medium risk: Race, marital status, drug use, household size during upbringing\n\n- Low risk: Physical attributes, mental health, religious belief\n\nGiven that there are multiple high-risk factors, particularly related to age, education, employment, and criminal history, it suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHowever, there are some low-risk factors, like not being depressed and having a religious belief, which might provide some protective effects.\n\nOverall, considering the preponderance of high-risk factors, I would predict a higher chance of rearrest within 3 years.\n\nLet's assign a confidence level. With multiple high-risk factors and fewer mitigating ones, I'll estimate a confidence of, say, 85%.\n\nSo, my prediction is YES, with 85% confidence.\n\nNow, to structure this in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young age correlated with higher recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of maturity.\"),\n\n(\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males have generally higher recidivism rates.\"),\n\n(\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic disparities may influence risk.\"),\n\n(\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"History of arrests and convictions indicates higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n\n(\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no marital ties may indicate less social support.\"),\n\n(\"Education\", \"high\", \"Low education levels link to higher recidivism due to limited opportunities.\"),\n\n(\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n\n(\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Substance use is associated with higher recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No current depression may be a positive sign.\"),\n\n(\"Household size during upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Large household may indicate less individual attention.\"),\n\n(\"Religious belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God possibly provides a positive influence.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n**Final JSON Output**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young age correlated with higher recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of maturity.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males have generally higher recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic disparities may influence risk.\"],\n    [\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"History of arrests and convictions indicates higher likelihood of reoffending.\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly related to recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no marital ties may indicate less social support.\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"high\", \"Low education levels link to higher recidivism due to limited opportunities.\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to higher risk of reoffending.\"],\n    [\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Substance use is associated with higher recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No current depression may be a positive sign.\"],\n    [\"Household size during upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Large household may indicate less individual attention.\"],\n    [\"Religious belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God possibly provides a positive influence.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\n",
