    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Age and gender are known risk factors; younger males tend to have higher rates of recidivism. Race can also be a factor due to systemic biases in the criminal justice system, but it's important to handle this sensitive information carefully.\n\nNext, he has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate issues with the legal process or behavioral tendencies that could lead to future arrests.\n\nHe is 5'9\" and weighs 188 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight don't typically correlate directly with recidivism risk, so I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living situation can be relevant; solitary living might indicate social isolation, which could be a risk factor.\n\nLack of high school diploma or GED and no college enrollment suggests lower educational attainment, which is associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nNo jobs held in the past year indicates unemployment, another significant risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years, but no other drug use is mentioned. Substance use is a known risk factor, but the specific type and frequency should be considered.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so the absence of recent depression is favorable.\n\nGrowing up, he lived with his biological dad in a household of two. Family structure can influence criminal behavior; living with both biological parents is generally considered protective, but in this case, it was only the biological dad.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with personal events, which might indicate religious involvement or spirituality, potentially a protective factor.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. Age and Gender: High risk. Young male age group is statistically more likely to be involved in criminal activities.\n\n2. Race: Medium risk. While race can influence interactions with the justice system, it's not directly indicative of personal risk.\n\n3. Arrest history without convictions: Medium risk. Suggests potential behavioral issues or systemic biases.\n\n4. Physical attributes: Low risk. Height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism.\n\n5. Living situation: Medium risk. Living alone may indicate social isolation, which can be a risk factor.\n\n6. Educational level: High risk. Lower education is linked to higher recidivism.\n\n7. Employment status: High risk. Unemployment increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n\n8. Substance use: Medium risk. Marijuana use is a factor, but the type and frequency need consideration.\n\n9. Mental health: Low risk. No recent depression is positive.\n\n10. Family structure: Medium risk. Living with only one biological parent may influence behavior.\n\n11. Belief in God's personal involvement: Low to medium risk. Could be a protective factor through religious involvement or personal morality.\n\nConsidering these factors, the prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is likely YES, given the high-risk categories like age, gender, education, and employment status. The confidence in this prediction is around 75%, considering both risk factors and some protective elements like no recent depression and a sense of personal faith.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age and Gender\", \"high\", \"Young male age group has higher recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic biases may affect interactions with the justice system.\"],\n    [\"Arrest history without convictions\", \"medium\", \"Indicates potential behavioral issues or legal system biases.\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate social isolation, a risk factor.\"],\n    [\"Educational level\", \"high\", \"Lower education correlated with higher recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases likelihood of reoffending.\"],\n    [\"Substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a factor, but type and frequency are considered.\"],\n    [\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is positive.\"],\n    [\"Family structure\", \"medium\", \"Living with only one biological parent may influence behavior.\"],\n    [\"Belief in God's personal involvement\", \"low\", \"Could be a protective factor through religion or personal morality.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
