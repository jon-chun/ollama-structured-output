    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and assign relative weights to each risk factor.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors:\n\n1. Age: 22 years old\n\n2. Gender: Female\n\n3. Race: White\n\n4. Arrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction\n\n5. Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\n6. Education: Bachelor's degree, not currently enrolled\n\n7. Employment: Held 4 jobs in the past year\n\n8. Substance use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, some drug use in the past month\n\n9. Mental health: Experiencing depression (felt down, nothing could cheer her up)\n\n10. Family background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of size 4\n\n11. Religious beliefs: Considers God has nothing to do with personal events\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each of these factors in terms of their impact on recidivism risk and assign a weight: low, medium, or high.\n\nStarting with age:\n\n- Age: 22 years old\n\nGenerally, younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism, but as they age, this risk decreases. At 22, she is still relatively young, but not in the typical high-risk teenage years. So, I would consider this a medium risk factor.\n\n(\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age, but past typical high-risk teenage years\")\n\nNext, gender:\n\n- Gender: Female\n\nFemales overall have lower recidivism rates compared to males. Therefore, being female is a low risk factor.\n\n(\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Lower recidivism rates for females\")\n\nRace:\n\n- Race: White\n\nRace can be a factor in recidivism, but in many studies, white individuals have lower recidivism rates compared to some other races. So, this would be a low risk factor.\n\n(\"Race\", \"low\", \"Lower recidivism rates for whites\")\n\nArrest history:\n\n- Arrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction\n\nHaving an arrest record, even without conviction, can sometimes influence future behavior or interactions with the justice system. However, only one arrest is not a strong indicator. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\n(\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"Single arrest with no conviction\")\n\nMarital status:\n\n- Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\nBeing unmarried and living alone can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism due to lack of social support. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\n(\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate less social support\")\n\nEducation:\n\n- Education: Bachelor's degree, not currently enrolled\n\nHigher education is generally associated with lower recidivism rates. Having a bachelor's degree is a positive factor, so this would be low risk.\n\n(\"Education\", \"low\", \"Higher education correlated with lower recidivism\")\n\nEmployment:\n\n- Employment: Held 4 jobs in the past year\n\nHigh job instability can be a risk factor for recidivism, as stable employment is often protective. Holding four jobs in a year suggests instability, so this is a medium to high risk factor. I'll go with high.\n\n(\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Job instability may indicate difficulty maintaining employment\")\n\nSubstance use:\n\n- Substance use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, some drug use in the past month\n\nDrug use, especially recent use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism. The use of both marijuana and cocaine, with recent use, suggests potential substance abuse issues. This is a high risk factor.\n\n(\"Substance use\", \"high\", \"History of drug use, including recent use of marijuana and cocaine\")\n\nMental health:\n\n- Mental health: Experiencing depression (felt down, nothing could cheer her up)\n\nMental health issues, particularly depression, can be related to higher recidivism rates due to underlying emotional distress and potential coping mechanisms. This is a medium to high risk factor. I'll assign it as high.\n\n(\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Experiencing depression may impact behavior and decision-making\")\n\nFamily background:\n\n- Family background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of size 4\n\nStable family environments, especially living with both biological parents, are generally protective factors against recidivism. This would be a low risk factor.\n\n(\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with both biological parents\")\n\nReligious beliefs:\n\n- Religious beliefs: Considers God has nothing to do with personal events\n\nReligious involvement can sometimes be a protective factor against recidivism, but the lack thereof may not necessarily be a risk factor. This is likely a low risk factor.\n\n(\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may not directly impact recidivism\")\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Medium: Age, Marital status, Family background\n\n- Low: Gender, Race, Arrest history, Education, Religious beliefs\n\n- High: Employment, Substance use, Mental health\n\nGiven that there are two high-risk factors (employment instability and substance use), along with one other high-risk factor in mental health, and only one medium-risk factor, with the rest being low risk, the overall risk of recidivism seems to be on the higher side.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider that some low-risk factors, like higher education and stable family background, may counterbalance some of the higher risks.\n\nDespite this, the combination of substance use, mental health issues, and employment instability are significant concerns.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is that there is a\u8f83\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669 of rearrest within the next three years.\n\nTo quantify this, considering the presence of multiple high-risk factors, I would estimate a confidence level of around 75%.\n\nSo, the final JSON object would be:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age, but past typical high-risk teenage years\"),\n\n(\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Lower recidivism rates for females\"),\n\n(\"Race\", \"low\", \"Lower recidivism rates for whites\"),\n\n(\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"Single arrest with no conviction\"),\n\n(\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate less social support\"),\n\n(\"Education\", \"low\", \"Higher education correlated with lower recidivism\"),\n\n(\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Job instability may indicate difficulty maintaining employment\"),\n\n(\"Substance use\", \"high\", \"History of drug use, including recent use of marijuana and cocaine\"),\n\n(\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Experiencing depression may impact behavior and decision-making\"),\n\n(\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with both biological parents\"),\n\n(\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may not directly impact recidivism\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",
