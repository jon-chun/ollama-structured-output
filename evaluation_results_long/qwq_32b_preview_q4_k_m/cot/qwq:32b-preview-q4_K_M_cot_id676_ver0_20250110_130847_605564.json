    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are known risk factors; young males tend to have higher rates of offending. So, being 21 and male likely contributes to a higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested 22 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests, which suggests a pattern of criminal behavior. Convictions confirm that these arrests led to guilty findings, which is a strong indicator of future offending.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145 feet 10 inches and 160 lbs\u2014don't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk, so I'll set that aside for now.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status can be a protective factor; being unmarried might increase risk. Living alone could also be a risk factor, as social support networks are important in preventing reoffending.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; lower education levels are associated with higher risks.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment stability is crucial; frequent job changes or unemployment can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, and has been feeling depressed recently. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors for recidivism.\n\nLooking back to his childhood, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size two in an urban area. Family structure and environment can influence criminal behavior, but without more details, it's hard to assess this fully.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual or religious beliefs can sometimes act as protective factors, but the absence of such beliefs isn't necessarily a risk factor unless it correlates with other issues.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these risk factors:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: Being a 21-year-old male\u2014high risk.\n\n   - Reasoning: Young males are statistically more likely to commit crimes.\n\n2. **Arrest and Conviction History**: 22 arrests with convictions\u2014high risk.\n\n   - Reasoning: A history of multiple arrests and convictions indicates a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Unmarried and living alone\u2014medium risk.\n\n   - Reasoning: Lack of marital ties and living alone can reduce social supports that might deter reoffending.\n\n4. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\u2014high risk.\n\n   - Reasoning: Lower educational achievement is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\n5. **Employment History**: Only one job in a year\u2014medium risk.\n\n   - Reasoning: Instability in employment can be a risk factor, but having at least one job is somewhat protective.\n\n6. **Substance Abuse and Mental Health**: Drug use and recent depression\u2014high risk.\n\n   - Reasoning: Both substance abuse and mental health issues are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\n7. **Early Family Environment**: Lived with biological mother in a small urban household\u2014low risk.\n\n   - Reasoning: Without more specific information about the household dynamics, this is neutral to low risk.\n\n8. **Spiritual Beliefs**: Doesn't believe God influences personal events\u2014low risk.\n\n   - Reasoning: Personal beliefs alone may not directly impact recidivism without\u5173\u8054\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u7efc\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u6027\u522b\u3001\u902e\u6355\u548c\u5b9a\u7f6a\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u7269\u8d28\u6ee5\u7528\u53ca\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u9884\u6d4b\u8be5\u4eba\u5728\u4e09\u5e74\u5185\u518d\u6b21\u88ab\u6355\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002\n\n\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u6bd4\u598285%\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684JSON\u5bf9\u8c61\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"Age and Gender\", \"high\", \"Young males have higher rates of offending.\"),\n\n    (\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone may lack social supports.\"),\n\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lower education is linked to higher recidivism.\"),\n\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"\u5c31\u4e1a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u5c11\u6709\u4e9b\u4fdd\u62a4\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\"),\n\n    (\"Substance Abuse and Mental Health\", \"high\", \"\u7269\u8d28\u6ee5\u7528\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u662f\u518d\u72af\u7684\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\"),\n\n    (\"Early Family Environment\", \"low\", \"\u6ca1\u6709\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\"),\n\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u4ef0\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u5230\u518d\u72af\u98ce\u9669\u3002\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",
