    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are known risk factors; younger males tend to have higher rates of recidivism. However, ethnicity can vary in its impact depending on the specific context and population studies.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might suggest some level of involvement in criminal activity, but the lack of conviction could indicate that the charges were unfounded or dismissed. This factor is a bit ambiguous.\n\nHis height and weight are given as 6 feet 0 inches and 155 lbs. Physical attributes like these aren't typically direct predictors of recidivism unless they relate to specific types of crimes or if there's a history of violence associated with them. In this case, without additional context, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status and living situation can be relevant; for instance, stable relationships and cohabitation with family members sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates. Living alone might be neutral or slightly increase risk, depending on support systems.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level is a strong protective factor against recidivism. Higher education generally correlates with better employment opportunities and lower likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment history is important; stable employment can reduce the chances of reoffending. Holding a job for a year is positive, but the type of job and the individual's satisfaction with it could also play a role.\n\nHe has not used any drugs in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism. The fact that he hasn't used drugs recently is a strong positive sign.\n\nHe has not felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues, including depression, can increase the risk of reoffending. The absence of recent depressive feelings is beneficial.\n\nGrowing up, he lived with both biological parents in a household of size four. Family structure during upbringing can influence criminal behavior later in life; living with both biological parents is generally considered more stable and protective against delinquency.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual or religious beliefs can sometimes serve as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and guidance. However, the absence of such beliefs doesn't necessarily imply higher risk; it depends on other support systems and personal values.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: High risk. Young male age is a well-established risk factor.\n\n2. **Arrest without Conviction**: Medium risk. Arrest suggests some level of involvement, but no conviction mitigates this somewhat.\n\n3. **Physical Attributes**: Low risk. Height and weight aren't directly linked to recidivism without additional context.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Medium risk. Living alone with no reported support systems could be a risk factor.\n\n5. **Education Level**: High protective factor (low risk). Being enrolled in college is positive.\n\n6. **Employment History**: Low risk. Holding a job for a year is favorable.\n\n7. **Substance Use**: Low risk. No drug use in the past four years is positive.\n\n8. **Mental Health**: Low risk. No recent depression is beneficial.\n\n9. **Family Structure During Upbringing**: Low risk. Stable family environment is protective.\n\n10. **Spiritual Beliefs**: Medium risk. Lack of spiritual guidance might be a minor risk factor, but it's unclear in this context.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the individual has several protective factors, including higher education, stable employment, no recent substance use or mental health issues, and a stable family background. The risks include young age, male gender, living alone, and a history of arrest without conviction.\n\nGiven the balance of these factors, my prediction is that the risk of rearrest recidivism over the next three years is\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u3002\u6211\u7ed9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5ea6\u625370\u5206\u3002\n\n**Final JSON Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age and Gender\", \"high\", \"Young male age is a well-established risk factor for recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Arrest without Conviction\", \"medium\", \"Arrest suggests some level of involvement, but no conviction mitigates this somewhat.\"],\n    [\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight aren't directly linked to recidivism without additional context.\"],\n    [\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no reported support systems could be a risk factor.\"],\n    [\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in college is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding a job for a year indicates stability.\"],\n    [\"Substance Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is positive.\"],\n    [\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is beneficial.\"],\n    [\"Family Structure During Upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"],\n    [\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of spiritual guidance might be a minor risk factor, but it's unclear in this context.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
