    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Age and gender are known risk factors; younger males tend to have higher rates of recidivism. Race can also be a factor due to systemic biases in the criminal justice system, but it's important to approach this carefully. So, I'll consider age and gender as medium risk factors.\n\nHe has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. Multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of recidivism. This should be a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches, and his weight is between 150 and 174 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight generally don't have a direct correlation with recidivism, so I'll classify this as low risk.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence recidivism; stable relationships and living arrangements are often protective factors. Living alone and never being married could be considered medium risk.\n\nHe does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; lower education levels are associated with higher risks. This should be a high-risk factor.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Employment history is crucial; unemployment is linked to higher recidivism rates. No job in the past year is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors for recidivism. Drug use and depressive symptoms both contribute to higher risks, so this is high risk.\n\nEarly life circumstances: He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Family structure and environment can influence criminal behavior, but without more details on the household dynamics or socioeconomic status, it's hard to assign a specific weight. I'll consider this a medium-risk factor.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs or lack thereof might influence behavior, but this is quite subjective and not a standard risk factor in recidivism assessments. I'll classify this as low risk.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n1. Age and Gender: Medium\n\n2. Number of Arrests and Convictions: High\n\n3. Physical Attributes: Low\n\n4. Marital Status and Living Situation: Medium\n\n5. Education Level: High\n\n6. Employment History: High\n\n7. Substance Abuse and Mental Health: High\n\n8. Early Life Circumstances: Medium\n\n9. Spiritual Beliefs: Low\n\nGiven these factors, particularly the multiple high-risk categories such as convictions, lack of education, unemployment, substance abuse, and mental health issues, it's likely that this individual has a higher probability of rearrest within the next three years.\n\nI would predict a \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of around 85%.\n\nSo, summarizing in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"Age and Gender\", \"medium\", \"Young male age group has higher recidivism rates.\"),\n\n    (\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate higher risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly correlated with recidivism.\"),\n\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone may lack supportive relationships.\"),\n\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED increases risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"No job in the past year indicates unemployment, a risk factor.\"),\n\n    (\"Substance Abuse and Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Drug use and depressive symptoms increase recidivism risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Early Life Circumstances\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in urban area; unclear household dynamics.\"),\n\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Personal beliefs about God not a standard recidivism factor.\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",
