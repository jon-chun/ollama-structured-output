    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 22-year-old White female over the next three years. She's been arrested once but not convicted, which is interesting. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Generally, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but she's already completed a Bachelor's degree and is in a graduate program. Education level is a big factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. So, her education level would likely be a protective factor, reducing the risk.\n\nShe's female, and gender is another important consideration. Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, being female is another protective factor.\n\nEthnicity is White. In some studies, ethnicity can play a role, but in combination with her gender and education, it likely doesn't add much risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrest without conviction could suggest that the legal system didn't find sufficient evidence for a conviction, which might indicate that the initial arrest was maybe unfounded or there were mitigating circumstances. However, an arrest is still a marker of potential involvement in criminal behavior, so it's a risk factor, but perhaps low impact given no conviction.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u2014height and weight\u2014don't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk unless there are specific contexts where they might be pertinent, which I don't see here.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Living alone could potentially be a risk factor if it means she lacks social support, which is important for rehabilitation. However, she's enrolled in graduate school, which suggests she has other forms of engagement and possibly social networks.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs in the past year. Employment is generally a protective factor, as it provides structure and income. Holding down two jobs might indicate responsibility and stability, which are positive signs.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years, and some days in the past month feeling down. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's ongoing. The depression symptoms are also concerning, as mental health issues can correlate with higher recidivism if not addressed.\n\nBackground: lived with both biological parents in a rural area, household size four. Family structure and environment during upbringing can influence criminal behavior, but in this case, living with both parents might be considered stable, which is positive.\n\nReligious belief: believes God has something to do with personal events. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes serve as a protective factor, providing moral guidance and support.\n\nSo, compiling these factors:\n\n1. Age: 22 \u2013 neutral to low risk.\n\n2. Gender: Female \u2013 low risk.\n\n3. Ethnicity: White \u2013 neutral.\n\n4. Education: Bachelor's degree, enrolled in graduate school \u2013 low risk.\n\n5. Arrest history: Arrested once, not convicted \u2013 low risk.\n\n6. Physical characteristics: Neutral.\n\n7. Marital status: Never married, living alone \u2013 potentially medium risk due to lack of social support.\n\n8. Employment: Held two jobs \u2013 low risk.\n\n9. Drug use: Marijuana use, some depression symptoms \u2013 medium to high risk.\n\n10. Background: Stable family upbringing \u2013 low risk.\n\n11. Religious belief: Believes in God's influence \u2013 low risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors collectively:\n\n- Strong protective factors: education, gender, employment, family background, religious beliefs.\n\n- Potential risk factors: living alone, drug use, depression symptoms.\n\nGiven that the protective factors outweigh the risk factors, and considering that her arrest did not lead to a conviction, I would predict a low risk of rearrest recidivism over the next three years.\n\nHowever, the drug use and depression symptoms are concerns that should be monitored, as they could potentially lead to future issues if not addressed.\n\nSo, my prediction is NO recidivism, with a confidence level of, say, 85%.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age: 22\", \"low\", \"Young age generally correlates with higher recidivism, but her education and employment suggest stability.\"],\n    [\"Gender: Female\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Ethnicity: White\", \"low\", \"No specific risk associated with ethnicity in this context.\"],\n    [\"Education: Bachelor's degree, enrolled in graduate program\", \"low\", \"Higher education is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Arrest history: Arrested once, not convicted\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests minimal criminal behavior.\"],\n    [\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly related to recidivism risk.\"],\n    [\"Marital status: Never married, living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support, which could be a risk factor.\"],\n    [\"Employment: Held two jobs\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is a protective factor.\"],\n    [\"Drug use: Marijuana in past four years, some depression symptoms\", \"high\", \"Drug use and mental health issues are significant risk factors for recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Background: Stable family upbringing\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents is a positive factor.\"],\n    [\"Religious belief: Believes God influences personal events\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can provide moral support and reduce recidivism risk.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\n",
