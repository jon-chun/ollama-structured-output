    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old White female over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and see how each factor might influence the prediction.\n\nFirst, her demographic details: she's 19, female, identifies as White, stands at 5'6\" and weighs between 125-149 lbs. Being female is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males, so that might lean towards a lower risk. Age is another important factor; younger individuals sometimes have higher recidivism rates because they may still be developing maturity and making poor choices. But being 19 is relatively young, and with age, people often stabilize their behavior. So, perhaps a medium risk here.\n\nMarital status: she's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be protective factors against recidivism, as they provide support and accountability. This might lean towards a lower risk.\n\nEducation: no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher recidivism rates, as it limits employment opportunities. This could be a medium to high risk factor.\n\nEmployment: held only one job during the year. Unstable employment can be related to higher recidivism, as individuals may turn to criminal activities due to lack of legitimate earning options. This might be another medium to high risk factor.\n\nSubstance use: has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, and has been feeling down lately. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as it can lead to continued illegal activities to support drug habits and impairs judgment and decision-making. The fact that she's been feeling depressed recently could indicate potential for increased substance use or other risky behaviors. This is likely a high-risk factor.\n\nEarly life experiences: lived with her biological mother in a rural area in a household of four. Family structure can be important; living with both parents is generally considered more stable, but since she was with her biological mother only, it might suggest some instability. However, without knowing if the father was absent or what the family dynamics were, it's hard to assign a definitive risk level here. Perhaps a low to medium risk factor.\n\nSpirituality: believes that God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing moral guidance and community support. This might lean towards a lower risk.\n\nNow, let's try to compile these factors and make a prediction.\n\nRisk Factors:\n\n1. Age and Gender: 19-year-old female - Medium (female leans low, young age leans higher)\n\n2. Marital Status: Married, living with spouse - Low\n\n3. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not in college - Medium to High\n\n4. Employment: Held only one job in a year - Medium to High\n\n5. Substance Use: History of drug use and recent depression - High\n\n6. Early Life Experiences: Single parent household in rural area - Low to Medium\n\n7. Spirituality: Believes God influences personal events - Low\n\nConsidering these factors, the substance use and employment education seem to be the highest risks, while marital status and spirituality are lower risks. The age and gender are somewhat mixed.\n\nGiven that, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest recidivism within three years, primarily due to the substance use and employment instability, despite some protective factors like being married and having spiritual beliefs.\n\nPrediction: YES\n\nConfidence: 75%\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age and Gender\", \"medium\", \"19-year-old female; females generally lower recidivism, but young age may indicate higher risk.\"),\n\n(\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \" Married and living with spouse, which is a protective factor.\"),\n\n(\"Education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, limiting employment opportunities.\"),\n\n(\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Only held one job in a year, indicating instability.\"),\n\n(\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"History of drug use including cocaine and marijuana, with recent depression symptoms.\"),\n\n(\"Early Life Experiences\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in rural area; single parent household may indicate some instability.\"),\n\n(\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences personal events, which can be a protective factor.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",
