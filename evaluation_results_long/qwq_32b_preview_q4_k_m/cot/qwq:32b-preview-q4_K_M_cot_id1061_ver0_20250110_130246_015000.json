    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I'm looking at this profile of an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. She's been arrested once but not convicted, which is interesting because usually convictions carry more weight in risk assessments. She's living alone, no high school diploma or GED, no employment in the last year, has used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently has been feeling pretty down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider demographic factors. Age is a big one. Eighteen is young, and youth can be a risk factor because impulsivity and lack of maturity can lead to risky behaviors. But on the other hand, people can change and grow quickly at that age. So, maybe medium risk for age.\n\nGender: she's female. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males. So, low risk here.\n\nRace: she identifies as Black. There are systemic issues that lead to disproportionate arrests and convictions of minorities, so I have to be careful here. But statistically, Black individuals do have higher arrest rates, which could indicate higher risk, but it's complicated by systemic biases. Maybe medium risk, acknowledging the statistical trends but being aware of the underlying issues.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Living alone could be a risk factor because lack of social support. So, maybe medium risk here as well.\n\nEducation: no high school diploma or GED. This is a significant risk factor. Education is strongly linked to employment and overall stability. So, high risk.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the last year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it limits opportunities and can lead to frustration and engagement in criminal activities. High risk here.\n\nDrug use: history of marijuana and cocaine use in the past four years, and recent depressive feelings. Substance abuse and mental health issues are major risk factors for recidivism. So, high risk.\n\nEarly life environment: lived with biological mother in a large household in an urban area. Large households can sometimes indicate overcrowding and potential lack of supervision, which could be a risk factor. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which could also influence behavior. So, maybe medium risk for early environment.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God has something to do with personal events. This could indicate a sense of accountability or moral guidance, which might be a protective factor. So, low risk here.\n\nNow, compiling these:\n\n- Age: medium\n\n- Gender: low\n\n- Race: medium\n\n- Marital status/living situation: medium\n\n- Education: high\n\n- Employment: high\n\n- Drug use/mental health: high\n\n- Early environment: medium\n\n- Religious beliefs: low\n\nLooking at this, the high risks in education, employment, and drug use/mental health are significant. These are major predictors of recidivism. The medium risks are also present, but the high ones are particularly concerning.\n\nGiven this, my prediction is that there is a\u8f83\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u4e09\u5e74\u5185\u518d\u6b21\u88ab\u6355\u3002\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6c34\u5e73\u5927\u7ea6\u662f80%\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0cJSON\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age can indicate impulsivity and lack of maturity.\"),\n\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Statistically, Black individuals have higher arrest rates, but considering systemic biases.\"),\n\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support.\"),\n\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor.\"),\n\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment limits opportunities and can lead to engagement in criminal activities.\"),\n\n    (\"drug_use_mental_health\", \"high\", \"History of drug use and recent depressive feelings are major risk factors.\"),\n\n    (\"early_environment\", \"medium\", \"Large household and urban upbringing may indicate lack of supervision and higher crime exposure.\"),\n\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence on personal events may serve as a protective factor.\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 80\n\n}\n\n",
