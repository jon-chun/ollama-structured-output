    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female identifying as mixed race. Age and gender can be significant factors in recidivism rates. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males, and younger individuals might be more likely to reoffend due to impulsivity and lack of maturity. However, at 22, she's somewhat past the peak ages for criminal behavior, which are typically in the late teens to early twenties. So, I'll consider her gender as a low-risk factor and her age as medium risk.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests that either the charges were dropped or she was found not guilty. Arrest history can be indicative of potential future offenses, but without a conviction, it's less straightforward. I'll rate this as low to medium risk.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse, which is generally considered a protective factor against recidivism. Stable relationships can provide support and deter involvement in criminal activities. This would be a low-risk factor.\n\nHer education level is low; she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; lower education levels are associated with higher risks. So, this would be a high-risk factor.\n\nEmployment status: she hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to idleness and potential engagement in criminal activities. This is another high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use: she has not used drugs in the past four years but has experienced some depressive symptoms in the past month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, but since she hasn't used drugs recently, this might be low to medium risk. However, her recent depressive symptoms could indicate underlying mental health issues that, if untreated, might increase her risk. So, I'll consider this as medium risk.\n\nFamily environment: she lived in a household of four when young. Household size isn't directly indicative of recidivism risk, but growing up in a larger family might affect supervision and resources available to her. This is probably a low-risk factor unless there's evidence of dysfunction in the household, which isn't provided here.\n\nLastly, her view on religion: she believes God has nothing to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against recidivism, but lack thereof doesn't necessarily increase risk. This is likely a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Gender (female): low risk\n\n- Age (22): medium risk\n\n- Arrest history (arrested once, not convicted): low to medium risk\n\n- Marital status (married, living with spouse): low risk\n\n- Education level (no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college): high risk\n\n- Employment status (no jobs in the past year): high risk\n\n- Drug use and mental health (no drug use in 4 years, recent depressive symptoms): medium risk\n\n- Household size during upbringing (four persons): low risk\n\n- Religious view: low risk\n\nConsidering these factors, the high-risk categories are education and employment, which are significant predictors of recidivism. The medium risks are age and recent depressive symptoms. Protective factors include being female, married, and living with her spouse.\n\nGiven this mix, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years due to the high-risk educational and employment statuses, despite the protective factors.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that predictive models should consider more data points for accuracy, and professional judgment should be exercised carefully.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n- **Prediction:** YES\n\n- **Confidence:** 70%\n\n**Risk Factors Assessment:**\n\n1. **Gender (Female):** Low risk. Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\n\n2. **Age (22):** Medium risk. Young adulthood can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors.\n\n3. **Arrest History (Arrested once, not convicted):** Medium risk. Arrest without conviction suggests potential involvement in criminal activities, but lack of conviction reduces the certainty.\n\n4. **Marital Status (Married, living with spouse):** Low risk. Stable relationships can provide support and deter reoffending.\n\n5. **Education Level (No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college):** High risk. Lower education is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\n6. **Employment Status (No jobs in the past year):** High risk. Unemployment can lead to engagement in criminal activities.\n\n7. **Drug Use and Mental Health (No drug use in 4 years, recent depressive symptoms):** Medium risk. History of no recent drug use is positive, but recent depressive symptoms may indicate potential mental health issues that could increase risk if not addressed.\n\n8. **Household Size during Upbringing (Four persons):** Low risk. Household size isn't directly indicative of recidivism risk without additional context.\n\n9. **Religious View (God has nothing to do with personal events):** Low risk. Lack of religious involvement doesn't necessarily correlate with higher recidivism.\n\n**JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Gender (Female)\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Age (22)\", \"medium\", \"Young adulthood can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors.\"],\n    [\"Arrest History (Arrested once, not convicted)\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction suggests potential involvement in criminal activities, but lack of conviction reduces the certainty.\"],\n    [\"Marital Status (Married, living with spouse)\", \"low\", \"Stable relationships can provide support and deter reoffending.\"],\n    [\"Education Level (No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college)\", \"high\", \"Lower education is linked to higher recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Employment Status (No jobs in the past year)\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to engagement in criminal activities.\"],\n    [\"Drug Use and Mental Health (No drug use in 4 years, recent depressive symptoms)\", \"medium\", \"History of no recent drug use is positive, but recent depressive symptoms may indicate potential mental health issues that could increase risk if not addressed.\"],\n    [\"Household Size during Upbringing (Four persons)\", \"low\", \"Household size isn't directly indicative of recidivism risk without additional context.\"],\n    [\"Religious View (God has nothing to do with personal events)\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement doesn't necessarily correlate with higher recidivism.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
