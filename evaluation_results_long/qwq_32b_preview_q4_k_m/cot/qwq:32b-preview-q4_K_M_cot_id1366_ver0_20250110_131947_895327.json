    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the subject is a 21-year-old female identified as White. Age and gender can be significant factors in recidivism rates. Generally, younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, but being female tends to lower the risk compared to males. So, age might be a medium risk factor, while gender is low.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once and convicted. This is her first conviction, which is relatively low in terms of criminal history. However, having a conviction does increase the risk somewhat. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHer height and weight are given as 5'4\" and between 125-149 lbs. Physical attributes like these don't typically correlate directly with recidivism rates, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nMarital status: she's never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism due to lack of social support. But being unmarried at 21 might not be uncommon, so I'll rate this as low to medium.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level is generally inversely related to recidivism; higher education reduces the risk. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nEmployment: She's held four jobs in a year. High job instability can be a risk factor for reoffending, as stable employment is associated with lower recidivism rates. Therefore, this would be a medium to high risk factor.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism, especially for drugs like cocaine. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she doesn't report depression recently, this is low.\n\nEarly life circumstances: Lived with her biological mother in an urban area in a household of four. Family structure and environment can influence criminal behavior. Living with both parents is often protective, but only living with the biological mother might be a medium risk factor.\n\nReligious belief: She believes God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor against reoffending. So, this could be a low risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Age: Medium\n\n- Gender: Low\n\n- Criminal history: Medium\n\n- Physical attributes: Low\n\n- Marital status/living situation: Medium\n\n- Education: Low\n\n- Employment stability: High\n\n- Drug use: High\n\n- Mental health: Low\n\n- Early family environment: Medium\n\n- Religious belief: Low\n\nLooking at these, the high-risk factors are employment instability and drug use, with several medium-risk factors like age, marital status, criminal history, and early family environment.\n\nGiven that, my prediction is that there is a\u8f83\u9ad8 risk of rearrest within 3 years. I'd estimate a confidence level of around 70%.\n\nSo, in JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age increases risk, but being female decreases it\"),\n\n(\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates\"),\n\n(\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"First conviction presents moderate risk\"),\n\n(\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not correlated with recidivism\"),\n\n(\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack social support\"),\n\n(\"education\", \"low\", \"College enrollment reduces risk\"),\n\n(\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes indicate instability, increasing risk\"),\n\n(\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"History of drug use, especially hard drugs, is a strong risk factor\"),\n\n(\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reported\"),\n\n(\"early_family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Single-parent household may pose risks\"),\n\n(\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be a protective factor\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\n",
