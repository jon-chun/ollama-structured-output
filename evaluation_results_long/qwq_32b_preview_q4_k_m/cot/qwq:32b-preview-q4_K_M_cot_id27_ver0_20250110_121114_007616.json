    "raw_message_text": "Alright, let's tackle this step by step. I'm looking at this case of a 21-year-old White female who's been arrested once but not convicted. She's living alone, has a GED, worked two jobs in the last year, has a history of drug use including marijuana and cocaine, and has been feeling pretty down lately. Also, some background about her childhood and her beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the risk factors here and assign them weights: low, medium, or high, based on how much they might contribute to her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Then, I'll use these to make a prediction: yes or no, and give a confidence level.\n\nLet's list out the factors:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old\n\n2. Gender: Female\n\n3. Race: White\n\n4. Arrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction\n\n5. Conviction history: None\n\n6. Current living situation: Living alone\n\n7. Marital status: Never married\n\n8. Education: GED, not enrolled in college\n\n9. Employment: Held 2 jobs in the last year\n\n10. Drug use: History of marijuana and cocaine use, recent use in the past month\n\n11. Mental health: Feeling down, nothing could cheer her up for all of the past month\n\n12. Family background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of 4\n\n13. Religious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nOkay, now I need to think about how each of these factors might relate to recidivism.\n\nStarting with age: 21 years old. Generally, younger ages are associated with higher rates of crime and recidivism, but as people age, they tend to settle down and engage in less criminal behavior. So, being 21 might be somewhat risky, but perhaps not extremely so. I'll tentatively label this as a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, gender: Female. Females overall have lower rates of arrest and conviction compared to males. So, being female is likely a low-risk factor.\n\nRace: White. In many studies, race can be a factor, but in the US, Whites are not typically overrepresented in criminal justice statistics compared to their population size, although there are variations depending on the specific crime. Perhaps this is a low-risk factor, but I should consider that drug use crosses racial lines broadly.\n\nArrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction. An arrest without conviction could indicate either that the behavior wasn't criminal or that the legal system didn't find sufficient evidence. Still, it suggests some level of involvement in illegal activities, so I'll consider this a medium-risk factor.\n\nConviction history: None. No convictions is positive, so low risk here.\n\nLiving alone: This could be a double-edged sword. On one hand, living alone might mean less social support, which could increase risk. On the other hand, it could mean independence and self-sufficiency. Given that she's holding down two jobs, perhaps it's more neutral to low risk.\n\nMarital status: Never married. Marital status can be protective against recidivism because of added responsibilities and social support. So, never being married might be a medium-risk factor.\n\nEducation: GED, not enrolled in college. Having a GED is better than no high school diploma, but not having further education could limit opportunities, potentially leading to higher risk. I'll call this a medium-risk factor.\n\nEmployment: Held 2 jobs in the last year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism because it provides stability and income. Holding two jobs suggests responsibility and possibly economic need, which could be positive. So, low risk here.\n\nDrug use: History of marijuana and cocaine use, recent use in the past month. Drug use, especially of harder substances like cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to addictive behaviors, legal issues, and impaired judgment. This is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nMental health: Feeling down, nothing could cheer her up for all of the past month. This sounds like symptoms of depression, which can impair judgment, lead to poor decision-making, and sometimes result in illegal activities. So, this is another high-risk factor.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of 4. Coming from a stable family structure could be protective, but living in an urban area might expose her to higher crime rates. Overall, perhaps this is a low to medium risk, leaning towards low.\n\nReligious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and support system, which might reduce recidivism risk. So, this could be a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, compiling these:\n\n- Age: Medium\n\n- Gender: Low\n\n- Race: Low\n\n- Arrest history: Medium\n\n- Conviction history: Low\n\n- Living situation: Low\n\n- Marital status: Medium\n\n- Education: Medium\n\n- Employment: Low\n\n- Drug use: High\n\n- Mental health: High\n\n- Family background: Low\n\n- Religious belief: Low\n\nLooking at this list, the high-risk factors are drug use and mental health, with several medium-risk factors like arrest history, marital status, and education.\n\nGiven that, my prediction is that there is a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years due to the significant risks posed by drug use and mental health issues.\n\nI would estimate my confidence at around 75%.\n\nSo, in JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age associated with higher crime rates\"),\n\n(\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females have lower arrest rates\"),\n\n(\"Race\", \"low\", \"Whites not overrepresented in criminal statistics\"),\n\n(\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests some risk\"),\n\n(\"Conviction history\", \"low\", \"No convictions is positive\"),\n\n(\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone but employed suggests independence\"),\n\n(\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may lack social supports\"),\n\n(\"Education\", \"medium\", \"GED without college limits opportunities\"),\n\n(\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates responsibility and stability\"),\n\n(\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"History of marijuana and cocaine use, recent use increases risk\"),\n\n(\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Symptoms of depression can lead to poor decisions\"),\n\n(\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family structure, urban upbringing\"),\n\n(\"Religious belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral support\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",
