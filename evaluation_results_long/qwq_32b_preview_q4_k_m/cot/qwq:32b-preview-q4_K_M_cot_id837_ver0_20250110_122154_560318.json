    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and consider each factor one by one, assigning a relative weight of low, medium, or high based on its potential impact on rearrest.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male identifying as White. Age is a significant factor in criminal behavior; younger individuals are often more impulsive and prone to risk-taking behaviors. Being male also correlates with higher rates of crime compared to females. Race can be a sensitive topic, but studies have shown varying recidivism rates across different ethnic groups. However, it's crucial to avoid stereotypes and consider this within the context of other factors.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once and convicted. This suggests that he has already engaged in criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses. The fact that he has only one arrest and conviction could indicate that this was perhaps an isolated incident, but it still poses a risk.\n\nHe is 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight generally have minimal direct impact on recidivism. However, in certain types of crimes, physical strength might be relevant, but without specific context, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status can influence an individual's stability and social support systems. Being unmarried and living alone may indicate a lack of familial support or accountability, which could increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to criminal behavior; lower education levels are associated with higher recidivism rates. Lack of educational achievement can limit employment opportunities, leading to frustration and potential engagement in criminal activities.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment history is crucial; stable employment can provide structure and a sense of purpose, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. Having only one job in a year might suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and has been feeling down most of the time during the past month. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant predictors of recidivism. Drug use can lead to criminal behavior to support the addiction, and depression can impair judgment and increase vulnerability to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nEarly life experiences are also important. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size five in a rural area. Family structure and environment during formative years can influence an individual's development and propensity for crime. Living in a single-parent home with multiple siblings might present challenges in supervision and resources, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs can have both positive and negative influences. For some, religion provides a moral compass and support system that deters criminal behavior, while for others, it might not play a significant role or could be misinterpreted to justify certain actions.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. Age: High (young age correlated with higher risk)\n2. Gender: Medium (males have higher crime rates, but individual variation exists)\n3. Race: Low (sensitive factor; may have some correlation but not primary)\n4. Arrest and conviction history: High (prior criminal behavior predicts future offenses)\n5. Physical attributes: Low (height and weight generally not directly related to recidivism)\n6. Marital status and living situation: Medium (living alone with no spouse may indicate less social support)\n7. Educational level: High (low education linked to higher recidivism)\n8. Employment history: High (employment stability is crucial for reducing recidivism)\n9. Substance abuse: High (drug use increases risk of reoffending)\n10. Mental health: High (depression can contribute to criminal behavior)\n11. Early family environment: Medium (single-parent household with multiple siblings may present challenges)\n12. Spiritual beliefs: Low (impact varies widely; could be positive or neutral)\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is YES. The individual has several high-risk factors, including young age, prior conviction, low education, unstable employment, substance abuse, and mental health issues. These outweigh the lower-risk factors, leading to a higher confidence in this prediction.\n\nConfidence: 85\n\n## Final Response\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young age correlated with higher risk of recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher crime rates, but individual variation exists.\"],\n    [\"Race\", \"low\", \"Sensitive factor; may have some correlation but not primary.\"],\n    [\"Arrest and conviction history\", \"high\", \"Prior criminal behavior predicts future offenses.\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight generally not directly related to recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no spouse may indicate less social support.\"],\n    [\"Educational level\", \"high\", \"Low education linked to higher recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Employment history\", \"high\", \"Employment stability is crucial for reducing recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Substance abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use increases risk of reoffending.\"],\n    [\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Depression can contribute to criminal behavior.\"],\n    [\"Early family environment\", \"medium\", \"Single-parent household with multiple siblings may present challenges.\"],\n    [\"Spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"Impact varies widely; could be positive or neutral.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
