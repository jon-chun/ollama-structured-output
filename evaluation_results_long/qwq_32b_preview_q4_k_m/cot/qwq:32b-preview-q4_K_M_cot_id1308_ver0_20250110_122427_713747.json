    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male identifying as Black. Age is a significant factor in criminal behavior; younger individuals are generally more prone to commit crimes, possibly due to impulsivity and lack of life experience. Being male also correlates with higher crime rates compared to females. Race can be a sensitive topic, but statistics show that certain racial groups may have higher incarceration rates, which could be due to systemic issues or other socioeconomic factors. However, it's crucial to approach this with caution and consider all other factors before making a judgment.\n\nNext, he has been arrested twice and has convictions. This suggests a pattern of criminal behavior, which increases the risk of recidivism. The number of prior arrests and convictions is a strong predictor of future offending.\n\nHis physical attributes\u20145 feet 9 inches tall and weighing 145 lbs\u2014don't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk unless there are specific circumstances where physical stature plays a role. In general, I wouldn't assign much weight to this factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status can be a protective factor against crime; married individuals often have more stability and social support, which may deter them from engaging in criminal activities. Living alone could mean less supervision and fewer accountability measures, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to crime rates; lower education levels are associated with higher crime rates. Lack of educational achievement can limit employment opportunities, leading to frustration and potential involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Employment is another protective factor; having a stable job can provide structure, income, and a sense of purpose, reducing the likelihood of committing crimes. Unemployment or lack of work history can increase the risk of recidivism.\n\nHe has not used any drugs in the past four years but has felt down most of the time during the past month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for crime, so his abstinence from drugs is positive. However, his recent feelings of depression could be a concern, as mental health issues can sometimes lead to criminal behavior if not properly managed.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with a household size of five, living with his biological mother, might indicate exposure to certain environmental factors that could influence his behavior. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and larger households might present challenges in supervision and resources.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally, which could suggest a level of spirituality or religiosity. Religious involvement is sometimes associated with lower crime rates, as it can provide moral guidance and community support.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. Age: 18 years old \u2013 High risk (due to youth and impulsivity)\n\n2. Gender: Male \u2013 High risk (higher crime rates among males)\n\n3. Race: Black \u2013 Medium risk (considering systemic issues and higher incarceration rates)\n\n4. Prior arrests: 2 arrests with convictions \u2013 High risk (history of criminal behavior)\n\n5. Physical attributes: Height and weight \u2013 Low risk (not directly relevant)\n\n6. Marital status: Never married, living alone \u2013 Medium risk (less social support and supervision)\n\n7. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college \u2013 High risk (limited educational attainment)\n\n8. Employment: No jobs in the past year \u2013 High risk (lack of stable employment)\n\n9. Substance abuse: No drug use in past four years \u2013 Low risk (abstinence from drugs)\n\n10. Mental health: Recent feelings of depression \u2013 Medium risk (potential impact on behavior)\n\n11. Upbringing: Urban area, household size 5, biological mother \u2013 Medium risk (possible environmental influences)\n\n12. Spirituality: Believes God affects personal events \u2013 Low to medium risk (potentially protective factor)\n\nConsidering these factors, the preponderance of high-risk indicators, particularly prior convictions, lack of education, unemployment, and young age, suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism. However, his abstention from drugs and his spiritual beliefs could be mitigating factors.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would predict a YES for 3-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of approximately 75%.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age: 18 years old\", \"high\", \"Youth and impulsivity increase risk.\"],\n    [\"Gender: Male\", \"high\", \"Higher crime rates among males.\"],\n    [\"Race: Black\", \"medium\", \"Systemic issues and higher incarceration rates.\"],\n    [\"Prior arrests: 2 with convictions\", \"high\", \"History of criminal behavior indicates higher risk.\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes: 5'9\\\", 145 lbs\", \"low\", \"Not directly related to recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Marital status: Never married, living alone\", \"medium\", \"Less social support and supervision.\"],\n    [\"Education: No high school diploma or GED, not in college\", \"high\", \"Limited educational attainment correlates with higher crime rates.\"],\n    [\"Employment: No jobs in past year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases recidivism risk.\"],\n    [\"Substance abuse: No drug use in past 4 years\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs is positive.\"],\n    [\"Mental health: Recent depression\", \"medium\", \"Potential impact on behavior.\"],\n    [\"Upbringing: Urban area, household size 5, biological mother\", \"medium\", \"Environmental factors may influence behavior.\"],\n    [\"Spirituality: Believes God affects personal events\", \"low\", \"Potentially protective factor.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
