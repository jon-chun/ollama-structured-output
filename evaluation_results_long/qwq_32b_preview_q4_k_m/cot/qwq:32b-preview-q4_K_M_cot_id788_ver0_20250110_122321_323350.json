    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the recidivism risk for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and assign relative weights to each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given factors:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old\n\n2. Gender: Male\n\n3. Race: White\n\n4. Arrest history: 2 arrests, convicted\n\n5. Physical attributes: 5'11\", 160 lbs\n\n6. Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\n7. Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college\n\n8. Employment: Held 2 jobs during the year\n\n9. Substance abuse: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, recent drug use unclear\n\n10. Mental health: Feels down in the dumps some of the time in the past month\n\n11. Family background: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4\n\n12. Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each of these factors in terms of their impact on recidivism risk and assign a relative weight: low, medium, or high.\n\nLet's start with age. Research shows that younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, possibly due to immaturity and impulsivity. Age 21 is relatively young, so this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, gender. Males are generally more prone to recidivism than females, possibly due to social and biological factors. So, being male could be a medium risk factor.\n\nRace: Being white, in many studies, doesn't carry the same risk as some other racial groups, but this can vary by jurisdiction and specific crimes. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nArrest and conviction history: Having been arrested twice and convicted suggests a pattern of offending behavior. This is likely a high risk factor.\n\nPhysical attributes: Height and weight don't typically correlate with recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone could indicate a lack of social support, which is a known risk factor. This might be a medium risk factor.\n\nEducation: High school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level can affect employment opportunities, which in turn affects recidivism. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nEmployment: Holding two jobs suggests stability and responsibility, which are protective factors against recidivism. This should be a low risk factor, perhaps even negative if we consider that multiple jobs might indicate overcompensation or stress.\n\nSubstance abuse: History of drug use, including cocaine, which is a high-risk substance. Recent use is mentioned for marijuana but not specified for cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. This should be high.\n\nMental health: Feeling down some of the time could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential self-medication and social difficulties. This should be medium to high, but I'll go with high given the potential severity.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in a household of size four. Family structure can be a factor; intact families often provide more support. However, without knowing the dynamics, it's hard to assess. I'll consider this a low to medium risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believing God influences personal events could indicate a sense of morality or possibly a support system through a religious community. This might be a low risk factor, potentially protective.\n\nNow, compiling these assessments:\n\n- Age: Medium\n\n- Gender: Medium\n\n- Race: Low\n\n- Arrest/conviction history: High\n\n- Physical attributes: Low\n\n- Marital status: Medium\n\n- Education: Medium\n\n- Employment: Low\n\n- Substance abuse: High\n\n- Mental health: High\n\n- Family background: Medium\n\n- Religious beliefs: Low\n\nLooking at these, the high-risk factors are arrest/conviction history, substance abuse, and mental health. These are significant predictors of recidivism.\n\nThe medium-risk factors include age, gender, marital status, education, and family background. These contribute to the overall risk but are not as impactful as the high-risk factors.\n\nThe low-risk factors, including race, physical attributes, employment, and religious beliefs, may have minimal impact or could even be protective.\n\nGiven that there are multiple high-risk factors present, particularly the conviction history, substance abuse, and mental health issues, it suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHowever, the individual is employed and has completed high school, which are positive signs. But the combination of conviction, drug use, and mental health problems outweighs these positives.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is that there is a high risk of rearrest within 3 years.\n\nAssigning a confidence level, given the presence of multiple high-risk factors, I would say 85%.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Prediction: YES\n\n- Confidence: 85%\n\nNow, to structure this in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors.\"),\n\n(\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n\n(\"Race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have different experiences with the justice system, but not a significant risk factor here.\"),\n\n(\"Arrest/conviction history\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions indicate a pattern of offending behavior.\"),\n\n(\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not correlated with recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate lack of social support.\"),\n\n(\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not in college may limit employment opportunities.\"),\n\n(\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs suggests responsibility and stability, which are protective factors.\"),\n\n(\"Substance abuse\", \"high\", \"History of drug use, including cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Reporting feelings of depression increases risk due to potential self-medication and social difficulties.\"),\n\n(\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size four; family structure could affect support systems.\"),\n\n(\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide moral guidance or community support.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n**Final Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates compared to females.\"],\n    [\"Race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have different experiences with the justice system, but not a significant risk factor here.\"],\n    [\"Arrest/conviction history\", \"high\", \"Prior convictions indicate a pattern of offending behavior.\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not correlated with recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate lack of social support.\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not in college may limit employment opportunities.\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs suggests responsibility and stability, which are protective factors.\"],\n    [\"Substance abuse\", \"high\", \"History of drug use, including cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Reporting feelings of depression increases risk due to potential self-medication and social difficulties.\"],\n    [\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size four; family structure could affect support systems.\"],\n    [\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide moral guidance or community support.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
