    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old Hispanic male over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and see how each factor might influence the prediction.\n\nFirst off, his demographic details: He's 19, male, Hispanic, 5'9\", 155 lbs. Being young and male are both risk factors for recidivism, as younger males tend to be more involved in criminal activities. Hispanics may also have higher recidivism rates depending on the jurisdiction and specific circumstances, but this can vary widely. His height and weight don't seem directly relevant unless there's something specific about his build that might indicate propensity for certain types of crimes, but I don't think that's the case here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could suggest either that the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence or that he was found not guilty. Either way, it indicates some level of involvement with the criminal justice system, which is a risk factor. However, the absence of convictions might slightly mitigate this.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse, which is generally considered a protective factor against recidivism. Stable relationships can provide support and discourage involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college and hasn't held a job in the past year. Educational attainment and employment are both significant factors. Having a high school diploma is better than not, but lack of current employment and no college enrollment could indicate unemployment or underemployment, which are risk factors for recidivism.\n\nDrug use\u2014specifically marijuana\u2014in the past four years is another risk factor. Substance use, even if it's marijuana, can be associated with higher rates of criminal behavior, although the relationship is complex.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can be linked to higher recidivism rates, so the absence of recent depression is a plus.\n\nHis upbringing: lived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Family structure can be a factor; living with both parents is generally considered protective. However, larger household sizes might present challenges, but again, this isn't always straightforward.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens personally, which could indicate a sense of accountability or guidance that might influence his behavior positively.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: High risk due to being young and male.\n   - Weight: High\n   - Reasoning: Demographic factors that have been consistently linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\n2. **Ethnicity**: Medium risk.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Varies by jurisdiction and specific circumstances; may require more context to accurately assess.\n\n3. **Arrest History**: Medium risk.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Arrests without convictions suggest some level of involvement but lack of conviction could indicate innocence or insufficient evidence.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Low risk.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Being married and living with spouse is a protective factor.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: Medium risk.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: High school diploma is positive, but lack of current employment and no college enrollment could indicate unemployment, which is a risk factor.\n\n6. **Drug Use**: Medium risk.\n   - Weight: Medium\n   - Reasoning: Marijuana use is a factor, but its impact can vary; may indicate some level of substance involvement.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: Low risk.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: No recent depression is positive.\n\n8. **Family Structure During Upbringing**: Low risk.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Living with both biological parents is generally protective.\n\n9. **Spiritual Beliefs**: Low risk.\n   - Weight: Low\n   - Reasoning: Belief in personal accountability through God may have a positive influence.\n\nNow, balancing these factors:\n\n- High-risk factors: Age and gender.\n- Medium-risk factors: Ethnicity, arrest history, education and employment, drug use.\n- Low-risk factors: Marital status, living situation, mental health, family structure, spiritual beliefs.\n\nGiven that there are more medium-risk factors than high or low, but considering the significant protective factors like being married and having a high school diploma, I would lean towards a moderate risk of recidivism.\n\nHowever, the lack of recent convictions and the presence of several protective factors might outweigh the risk factors. Therefore, my prediction is that he will not be rearrested within the next three years.\n\n**Prediction: NO**\n\n**Confidence: 70**\n\nSo, the final JSON object would look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age and Gender\", \"high\", \"Young male demographic linked to higher recidivism rates\"],\n    [\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Variable impact depending on jurisdiction and circumstances\"],\n    [\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"Arrests without convictions suggest some involvement but lack of conviction\"],\n    [\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Married and living with spouse is protective\"],\n    [\"Education and Employment\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but unemployed, a risk factor\"],\n    [\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use indicates some substance involvement\"],\n    [\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is positive\"],\n    [\"Family Structure During Upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents is protective\"],\n    [\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in personal accountability through God may be positive\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
