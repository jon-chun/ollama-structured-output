    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I have this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for a 20-year-old white female over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and consider each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's 20 years old. Generally, younger age is associated with higher recidivism rates, but I need to see how this fits into the bigger picture.\n\nShe's a female, which typically correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, that's a positive point.\n\nHer ethnicity is white. Ethnicity can be a factor, but it's essential to handle this sensitively and ensure that any considerations are based on statistical trends rather than stereotypes.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might suggest that the charges were dropped or she was found not guilty, which could indicate lower risk. However, it also shows some involvement in criminal activity.\n\nHer height and weight\u20145'7\" and 150-174 lbs\u2014don't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk. I'll set this aside unless there's a specific context where physical attributes play a role.\n\nShe has never been married and is living alone. Living situation can be a factor; living alone might indicate less social support, which could potentially increase risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. Education level is important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Not being in college might suggest lower educational attainment, possibly increasing risk.\n\nShe has held four jobs in the past year. That's quite frequent job changes, which could indicate instability in employment, a factor that might increase recidivism risk.\n\nDrug use: she has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed in the last month. Substance use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's ongoing. However, the fact that she hasn't felt depressed recently could be a positive sign.\n\nEarly family environment: lived with both biological parents in a household of five in a rural area. Family structure and environment can influence criminal behavior. Living with both parents is generally considered protective, but I need to consider how this might interact with other factors.\n\nHer view on God's influence on personal events: she believes God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism, but this is nuanced and varies widely.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 20 years old \u2013 Medium risk due to youth but balancing with gender.\n\n2. Gender: Female \u2013 Low risk.\n\n3. Ethnicity: White \u2013 Neutral; depends on other factors.\n\n4. Arrest history: Arrested once, not convicted \u2013 Low to medium risk.\n\n5. Living situation: Lives alone, never married \u2013 Medium risk.\n\n6. Education: High school diploma, not in college \u2013 Medium risk.\n\n7. Employment stability: Four jobs in a year \u2013 High risk.\n\n8. Substance use: Marijuana use in past four years \u2013 Medium to high risk.\n\n9. Mental health: No depression in the last month \u2013 Low risk.\n\n10. Family environment: Lived with both parents in a rural area \u2013 Low risk.\n\n11. Spiritual beliefs: God has nothing to do with personal events \u2013 Neutral to low risk.\n\nConsidering these factors, the key risks seem to be employment instability and substance use, both of which are significant predictors of recidivism. The protective factors include being female, having a high school diploma, living with both parents during upbringing, and not currently experiencing depression.\n\nGiven this mix, I would predict a moderate to high risk of rearrest within three years. However, the lack of a conviction and the positive aspects of her background suggest that with appropriate interventions, such as stable employment support and substance abuse counseling, the risk could be mitigated.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'd say 70%. There are substantial risks present, but also some protective factors that could influence outcomes.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n\n- Prediction: YES, there is a risk of rearrest within three years.\n\n- Confidence: 70%\n\nNow, to structure this in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Youth is associated with higher recidivism, but balanced by gender.\"),\n\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"neutral\", \"Ethnicity is considered with caution, based on statistical trends.\"),\n\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low-medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests possible lower risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not in college indicates moderate educational level.\"),\n\n    (\"Employment stability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, increasing risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Substance use\", \"medium-high\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive sign.\"),\n\n    (\"Family environment\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents is protective.\"),\n\n    (\"Spiritual beliefs\", \"neutral-low\", \"Beliefs may have varying impacts on individual behavior.\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\n**Final Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Youth is associated with higher recidivism, but balanced by gender.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Ethnicity\", \"neutral\", \"Ethnicity is considered with caution, based on statistical trends.\"],\n    [\"Arrest history\", \"low-medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests possible lower risk.\"],\n    [\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not in college indicates moderate educational level.\"],\n    [\"Employment stability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, increasing risk.\"],\n    [\"Substance use\", \"medium-high\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor for recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive sign.\"],\n    [\"Family environment\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents is protective.\"],\n    [\"Spiritual beliefs\", \"neutral-low\", \"Beliefs may have varying impacts on individual behavior.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
