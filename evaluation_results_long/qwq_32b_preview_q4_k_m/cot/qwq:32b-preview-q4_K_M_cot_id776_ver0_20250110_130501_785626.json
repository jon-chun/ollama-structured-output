    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 19-year-old White male over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and see how each factor might influence the prediction.\n\nFirst off, he's 19 years old. Age is a significant factor in criminal behavior. Statistics show that crime rates tend to peak in late adolescence and early twenties, and then decline as people get older. So, being 19 places him in that higher-risk age group. But, it's not the only factor, and there are others that might mitigate this risk.\n\nHe's male, which also tends to be associated with higher rates of criminal activity compared to females. Biological and social factors play a role here, but again, it's just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nHis ethnicity is White. In some studies, race can be a factor, but it's important to approach this cautiously and ensure that any considerations are based on solid evidence and not stereotypes.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. This is a crucial point. Having a prior conviction indicates that he has engaged in criminal behavior in the past, which could suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending. However, it's just one arrest and conviction, so it's not a extensive criminal history.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 190 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight don't typically have a direct correlation with recidivism. So, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living situation can be relevant. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor. On the other hand, some people manage well on their own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level is generally inversely related to criminal behavior. Higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates because it can lead to better job opportunities and socioeconomic status. So, being enrolled in college is a positive sign.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment history is important. Stable employment can reduce the likelihood of reoffending by providing structure and income. Holding two jobs suggests responsibility and perhaps a commitment to stability.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Substance use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Even though it's marijuana, which is less severe than harder drugs, any drug use can indicate potential issues that may lead to reoffending.\n\nHe has not felt depressed over the past month. Mental health status is crucial. Depression and other mental health issues can be linked to criminal behavior. That he hasn't felt depressed recently is positive, but it's important to consider if there's a history of mental health problems.\n\nGrowing up, he lived with both biological parents in a household of size four in a rural area. Family structure and environment during upbringing can influence future behavior. Living with both parents is generally considered beneficial, but again, this is just one aspect.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing guidance and a sense of morality that may deter criminal activity.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. Age: High risk (due to being in the higher-risk age group)\n\n2. Gender: Medium risk (males have higher crime rates, but it's a general statistic)\n\n3. Ethnicity: Low risk (no specific indications; needs to be handled carefully)\n\n4. Prior arrests and convictions: High risk (indicative of past criminal behavior)\n\n5. Physical attributes: Low risk (height and weight not directly related to recidivism)\n\n6. Living situation: Medium risk (living alone with potential lack of social support)\n\n7. Education level: Low risk (enrolled in college, positive sign)\n\n8. Employment history: Low risk (held two jobs, shows responsibility)\n\n9. Drug use: High risk (past drug use, even if it's marijuana)\n\n10. Mental health: Low risk (no depression in the past month)\n\n11. Family structure during upbringing: Low risk (stable family environment)\n\n12. Spiritual beliefs: Low risk (may act as a deterrent)\n\nConsidering these factors, there are several high-risk elements (age, gender, prior convictions, drug use) and some low-risk mitigating factors (education, employment, spiritual beliefs). The medium-risk factors include living situation and ethnicity.\n\nGiven this mix, I would predict that there is a moderate to high risk of rearrest recidivism over the next three years. However, the individual's current positive behaviors, such as being in college and having stable employment, suggest that with continued support and perhaps addressing the drug use issue, the risk could be managed.\n\nI'll assign a prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism, but with a confidence level of 65%. This accounts for the presence of multiple risk factors but also acknowledges the protective factors present in his current life situation.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"high\", \"Being 19 places him in a higher-risk age group for criminal activity.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have statistically higher crime rates.\"],\n    [\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"No specific indications; handled cautiously.\"],\n    [\"Prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Indicative of past criminal behavior.\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly related to recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"],\n    [\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college, positive sign.\"],\n    [\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs, shows responsibility.\"],\n    [\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use, even if it's marijuana, is a risk factor.\"],\n    [\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month.\"],\n    [\"Family structure during upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment.\"],\n    [\"Spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"May act as a deterrent to criminal behavior.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n",
