    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male identifying as White. Age and gender are known risk factors in criminal justice; younger males tend to have higher rates of recidivism. So, being 21 and male might indicate a higher risk. But I need to consider this in conjunction with other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests don't necessarily lead to convictions, but multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that might increase the risk of future arrests. However, since there are no convictions, it's possible that these arrests were unfounded. I'll have to weigh this carefully.\n\nHis physical attributes: 5'10\" and 195 lbs. I'm not sure how much weight should be given to height and weight in predicting recidivism. These might not be directly relevant unless they relate to specific types of crimes. For now, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status and living situation can be indicators. Generally, being married and having a stable living arrangement are considered protective factors against recidivism. So, living alone without a spouse might be a medium risk factor.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a GED but is not enrolled in college. Having a GED is better than no high school diploma, but not pursuing higher education could be a risk factor. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. So, this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nEmployment: He has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism. People without stable employment may turn to criminal activities out of necessity or lack of opportunities. This is likely a high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior and recidivism. Both legal and illegal drug use can impair judgment and lead to involvement in crime. This is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, but since he doesn't report depression recently, this might be a low-risk factor. However, the absence of reported depression doesn't rule out other mental health issues, so perhaps it's medium risk.\n\nEarly life circumstances: He lived with his biological mother in a household of size seven in an urban area. Family structure and environment can influence criminal behavior. Living in a large household might indicate overcrowding and potential lack of attention, which could be a risk factor. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which might also influence individual behavior. This could be considered a medium risk factor.\n\nNow, let's summarize the risk factors with their assigned weights and reasoning:\n\n1. Age and Gender: High (young male)\n2. Arrest history: Medium (arrested twice, no convictions)\n3. Physical attributes: Low (height and weight likely irrelevant)\n4. Marital status and living situation: Medium (living alone, never married)\n5. Education: Medium (GED, not enrolled in college)\n6. Employment: High (no jobs in the past year)\n7. Drug use: High (uses marijuana and cocaine)\n8. Mental health: Medium (no recent depression reported)\n9. Early life circumstances: Medium (large household, urban area)\n\nBased on these factors, particularly the high-risk categories like employment status and drug use, it seems likely that this individual has a higher probability of being rearrested within the next three years.\n\nI would predict recidivism: YES\n\nConsidering the multiple high-risk factors, I'd estimate a confidence level of around 85%.\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age and Gender\", \"high\", \"Young male, higher recidivism rates\"),\n\n(\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Arrested twice, no convictions\"),\n\n(\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly relevant\"),\n\n(\"Marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, never married\"),\n\n(\"Education\", \"medium\", \"GED, not enrolled in college\"),\n\n(\"Employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs in the past year\"),\n\n(\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Uses marijuana and cocaine\"),\n\n(\"Mental health\", \"medium\", \"No recent depression reported\"),\n\n(\"Early life circumstances\", \"medium\", \"Large household, urban area\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",
