    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I have this case to predict whether this 18-year-old black male will be rearrested within three years. He's been arrested 17 times and convicted. He's 5 feet 3 inches tall, weighs 155 lbs, never married, lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, has held one job in the past year, uses marijuana and cocaine, and has been feeling depressed all the time for the past month. He lived with his biological mother in an urban area when he was young and doesn't believe God influences his life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what factors might predict rearrest recidivism based on the examples provided. Let's look at the n-shot examples to see patterns.\n\nIn example #1, it's a 25-year-old white male with one arrest, no conviction, lives with parents, high school diploma, employed, doesn't use drugs, never felt depressed, and believes in God. The outcome was \"NO\" for rearrest.\n\nExample #2 is a 20-year-old black male with five arrests, convicted, lives alone, no high school diploma, unemployed, uses drugs, often depressed, and doesn't believe in God. Outcome was \"YES.\"\n\nExample #3 is similar to #2 but with different specifics, still \"YES.\"\n\nExample #4 is a 22-year-old hispanic female with two arrests, convicted, lives with others, high school diploma, employed, no drug use, sometimes depressed, believes in God. Outcome \"NO.\"\n\nLooking at these, it seems that factors like number of arrests, convictions, employment, education, drug use, depression, and belief in God play a role.\n\nLet me try to assign weights to these factors based on the examples:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests**: Higher number seems to increase risk. Example #2 with 5 arrests was \"YES,\" while example #1 with 1 arrest was \"NO.\" So, this is probably a high-weight factor.\n\n2. **Convictions**: Having convictions might increase risk. Example #2 was convicted and had \"YES,\" while example #1 wasn't convicted and had \"NO.\"\n\n3. **Employment**: Employed seems better. Example #1 was employed (\"YES\") vs. example #2 unemployed (\"YES\"), but example #4 was employed but still \"NO.\" So, maybe employment is medium weight.\n\n4. **Education**: Higher education might help. Example #1 has a high school diploma, \"NO,\" while example #2 doesn't, \"YES.\" So, education could be medium weight.\n\n5. **Drug Use**: Using drugs seems to increase risk. Example #2 uses drugs, \"YES,\" example #4 doesn't use drugs, \"NO.\" So, drug use is probably high weight.\n\n6. **Depression**: Persistent depression might increase risk. Example #2 is often depressed, \"YES,\" while example #4 is sometimes depressed, \"NO.\" So, depression could be medium to high weight.\n\n7. **Living Situation**: Living with parents seems better. Example #1 lives with parents, \"NO,\" while example #2 lives alone, \"YES.\" So, living situation might be medium weight.\n\n8. **Belief in God**: Believing in God might have some influence. Example #1 believes, \"NO,\" example #2 doesn't, \"YES.\" But example #4 believes and is \"NO,\" so maybe this is a medium weight factor.\n\nNow, looking at the specific case:\n\n- **Age**: 18, which is younger compared to some examples, but still an adult.\n\n- **Race**: Black, which might have societal implications, but I need to focus on the factors provided.\n\n- **Number of Arrests**: 17 times, which is significantly higher than other examples. This is a very high number, so this factor should be weighted heavily towards \"YES.\"\n\n- **Convictions**: He has been convicted, which, based on example #2, increases the risk.\n\n- **Height and Weight**: 5'3\", 155 lbs. Not sure how this affects rearrest rates. Probably not directly relevant, so low weight.\n\n- **Marital Status**: Never married, living alone. Based on examples, living with parents is better, so living alone might be negative, medium weight.\n\n- **Education**: No high school diploma or GED, which is similar to example #2, \"YES.\" So, this is a negative factor, medium weight.\n\n- **Employment**: Held one job in the past year. Not consistently employed, which might be similar to being unemployed. So, this is negative, medium weight.\n\n- **Drug Use**: Uses marijuana and cocaine, which is a significant negative factor, high weight.\n\n- **Depression**: Feels depressed all the time for the past month, which is severe, so this should be a high-weight negative factor.\n\n- **Upbringing**: Lived with biological mother in an urban area. Not sure how this compares to other upbringing situations. Probably low weight.\n\n- **Belief in God**: Doesn't believe God influences his life. Based on examples, this might be medium weight towards \"YES.\"\n\nConsidering all these factors, especially the high number of arrests, drug use, severe depression, and lack of education and stable employment, it seems very likely that this individual will be rearrested within three years.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any positive factors. He's young, and sometimes younger people have more room for change, but given the severity and frequency of his arrests, convictions, and current circumstances, it's hard to see many positives here.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is \"YES\" for rearrest within three years.\n\nBut let's look back at the examples to confirm. Example #5 was a 21-year-old white female with three arrests, convicted, lives alone, high school diploma, unemployed, uses drugs, often depressed, doesn't believe in God, outcome \"YES.\" Similar to our case but with fewer arrests and a different gender, still \"YES.\"\n\nExample #6 was a 23-year-old hispanic male with two arrests, not convicted, lives with parents, some college, employed, no drug use, never depressed, believes in God, outcome \"NO.\" Completely opposite scenario, \"NO.\"\n\nExample #7 was a 19-year-old black male with 10 arrests, convicted, lives alone, no high school diploma, unemployed, uses drugs, always depressed, doesn't believe in God, outcome \"YES.\" Very similar to our case, \"YES.\"\n\nExample #8 was a 24-year-old white female with one arrest, not convicted, lives with partner, college degree, employed, no drug use, sometimes depressed, believes in God, outcome \"NO.\" Again, very different, \"NO.\"\n\nExample #9 was a 22-year-old black male with five arrests, convicted, lives alone, high school diploma, unemployed, uses drugs, often depressed, doesn't believe in God, outcome \"YES.\" Similar to our case but with fewer arrests, still \"YES.\"\n\nExample #10 was a 20-year-old asian female with zero arrests, no conviction, lives with parents, bachelor's degree, employed, no drug use, never depressed, believes in God, outcome \"NO.\" Perfect scenario, \"NO.\"\n\nFrom these, it's clear that high number of arrests, convictions, living alone, no education, unemployment, drug use, depression, and lack of belief in God all point towards \"YES.\" Our case has almost all of these negative factors, especially the extremely high number of arrests.\n\nTherefore, I am confident in predicting \"YES\" for rearrest within three years.\n\n## Final Prediction\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"Yes\"\n}\n```",
