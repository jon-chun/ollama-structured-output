    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to predict whether this person will be rearrested within three years. Let's see what we have here.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old white male. He's been arrested once but not convicted. He's 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 190 pounds. He's never been married and lives alone. He has a high school diploma and is currently enrolled in a four-year college. He's held one job in the past year. He has used drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years, but he hasn't felt depressed in the last month. When he was young, he lived with both biological parents in a four-person household in an urban area. He believes that God plays a role in his life.\n\nOkay, so I need to look at these factors and see which ones might increase or decrease the chance of him being rearrested in three years. Let's consider each one step by step.\n\n**Age:** He's 20 years old. In the examples, most people are around 18 to 22, so age doesn't seem too unusual. But maybe younger ages have higher recidivism rates?\n\n**Race:** He's white. In the examples, there are blacks and whites, but I don't see a clear pattern based on race alone.\n\n**Arrest history:** He's been arrested once but not convicted. In example #10, someone was arrested once but not convicted and didn't recidivate. So maybe just one arrest without conviction isn't a big red flag.\n\n**Height and weight:** 5'11\" and 190 lbs. Doesn't seem relevant unless there's something about physicality in crimes, but I don't see that in the examples.\n\n**Marital status:** Never married, lives alone. In example #4, someone living alone didn't recidivate, and in #7, someone living with others did. Maybe living alone isn't a strong predictor.\n\n**Education:** He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. That seems positive. In example #15, someone with some college didn't recidivate.\n\n**Employment:** Held one job in the past year. Not sure if that's good or bad. In example #2, multiple jobs were mentioned, and that person recidivated, but in #14, one job and no recidivism.\n\n**Drug use:** Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That seems like a significant risk factor. In example #3, drug use was a factor in recidivism.\n\n**Mental health:** No depression in the past month. That's positive. In example #12, depression was present, and the outcome was no recidivism.\n\n**Family background:** Lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Seems stable compared to some of the other examples where single-parent households were more common among those who recidivated.\n\n**Religious belief:** Believes God plays a role in his life. In example #5, similar belief didn't prevent recidivism, but in #18, it might have helped.\n\nOkay, let's try to assign some weights to these factors based on the examples.\n\n**Drug use:** High weight. Especially since he's used both marijuana and cocaine. In several examples, drug use was present, and recidivism occurred.\n\n**Age:** Medium weight. Younger age might be slightly higher risk, but not extremely so.\n\n**Arrest history:** Low weight. Since he was only arrested once and not convicted, maybe this isn't as strong a predictor.\n\n**Education and employment:** Both positive factors, so low to medium weight in the opposite direction.\n\n**Living situation:** Medium weight. Living alone might be slightly riskier, but not confidently so.\n\n**Family background and religious belief:** Medium weight. Stable family background might be protective.\n\n**Mental health:** Low weight. No depression is positive, but not a strong predictor on its own.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems like the drug use is the biggest red flag here. Despite his education and seemingly stable background, the fact that he's used illicit drugs, particularly cocaine, worries me. In several examples, drug use was associated with recidivism.\n\nHowever, he's enrolled in college, which might suggest a certain level of stability and future orientation. Also, not feeling depressed is positive.\n\nPerhaps my prediction would be \"YES\" for recidivism, but with medium confidence, say 60%. The drug use tips it over, but the educational and living circumstances make me hesitate.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n{\n\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"History of using marijuana and cocaine, which was present in several recidivism cases.\"),\n\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age, but not extremely low, which might indicate higher risk.\"),\n\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction, which doesn't strongly predict recidivism.\"),\n\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college, which is positive, but not a strong protective factor on its own.\"),\n\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held one job in the past year; employment history is unclear.\"),\n\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, which might be slightly riskier, but not confidently so.\"),\n\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Stable family background, which could be protective.\"),\n\n    (\"Religious belief\", \"medium\", \"Believes God plays a role, which might have some influence.\"),\n\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month, which is positive.\")\n\n  ],\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 0.6\n\n}\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe primary driving factor for predicting recidivism is the history of drug use, particularly the use of cocaine, which is a significant red flag. While the individual is enrolled in college and has no current depression, these positive factors are outweighed by the drug use history. The arrest without conviction and living alone also add to the risk profile, although to a lesser extent. The stable family background and religious beliefs are considered mitigating factors but are not strong enough to override the drug use history.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n{\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 0.6\n\n}\n\n## Final Solution\nTo predict whether the individual will be rearrested within three years, we need to analyze various factors from their profile and compare them with provided examples to assign weights and make an informed decision.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Key Factors:**\n   - Age, race, arrest history, living situation, education, employment, drug use, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs.\n\n2. **Assign Weights to Factors:**\n   - Based on the provided examples, determine which factors are most strongly correlated with recidivism.\n\n3. **Evaluate Each Factor:**\n   - Assess how each factor in the individual's profile relates to the trends observed in the examples.\n\n4. **Make a Prediction:**\n   - Combine the weighted factors to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Define the individual's profile\nprofile = {\n    \"age\": 20,\n    \"race\": \"white\",\n    \"arrest_history\": \"arrested once, not convicted\",\n    \"living_situation\": \"lives alone\",\n    \"education\": \"high school diploma, enrolled in college\",\n    \"employment\": \"held one job in the past year\",\n    \"drug_use\": \"marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\",\n    \"mental_health\": \"no depression in the past month\",\n    \"family_background\": \"lived with both biological parents in an urban area\",\n    \"religious_belief\": \"believes God plays a role in his life\"\n}\n\n# Define the risk factors and their weights based on provided examples\nrisk_factors = [\n    {\"factor\": \"Drug use\", \"weight\": \"high\", \"description\": \"History of using marijuana and cocaine, which was present in several recidivism cases.\"},\n    {\"factor\": \"Age\", \"weight\": \"medium\", \"description\": \"Young age, but not extremely low, which might indicate higher risk.\"},\n    {\"factor\": \"Arrest history\", \"weight\": \"low\", \"description\": \"Only one arrest with no conviction, which doesn't strongly predict recidivism.\"},\n    {\"factor\": \"Education\", \"weight\": \"low\", \"description\": \"Enrolled in college, which is positive, but not a strong protective factor on its own.\"},\n    {\"factor\": \"Employment\", \"weight\": \"low\", \"description\": \"Held one job in the past year;
