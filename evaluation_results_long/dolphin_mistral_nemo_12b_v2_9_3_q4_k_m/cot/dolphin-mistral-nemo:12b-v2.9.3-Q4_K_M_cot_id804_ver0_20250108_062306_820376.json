Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as mixed race. She has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 139 lbs. She is divorced and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3.
