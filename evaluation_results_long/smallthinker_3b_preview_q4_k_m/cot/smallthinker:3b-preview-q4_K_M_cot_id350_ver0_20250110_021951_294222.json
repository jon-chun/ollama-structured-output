    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully evaluate each risk factor for the 22-year-old White female and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] before using them collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start with her arrest history. She has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. Wait, let me check the implications of this... Since she hasn't been convicted yet, it suggests that she may be less likely to reoffend in the future. However, being arrested multiple times still indicates a pattern of behavior. Let me weigh these factors... I think her arrest history warrants a medium weight.\n\nNext, I'll consider her biological parents' household size when she was young. She lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 6. This is an important factor because it may indicate a lack of individual attention and support. Let me think about how this compares to other factors... Given that she has only been living alone since the age of 21, this experience might be significant in shaping her behavior and social skills. I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's examine her depression history. She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign. However, considering that she has lived with both biological parents who may have been able to provide emotional support but instead did not, it's possible that these individuals might have played a role in shaping her mental health and behavior. Let me balance these perspectives... I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nHer education level is another crucial aspect. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. While having some formal education can be beneficial, it doesn't necessarily indicate an increased risk of reoffending. Wait a minute... The fact that she's not currently pursuing higher education might suggest that she values her current lifestyle or has other priorities. However, this alone isn't enough to classify as a high-risk factor. I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nHer employment history is also worth considering. She has held only one job during the year, which could indicate some instability in her life. Let me think about how this might relate to her likelihood of reoffending... Given that she's had limited work experience and doesn't seem to be actively seeking new opportunities, this might be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHer substance use history is another factor. She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive development. Let me reflect on how this compares to other factors... Since she has no current substance use issues or a history of addiction, it suggests that she may be at lower risk for reoffending due to substance-related issues.\n\nConsidering her beliefs about God and personal life, she believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This is an interesting aspect because it might influence her perception of the world and her actions. However, let me weigh this against other factors... Without further context or evidence suggesting a direct link to criminal behavior, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nHer living situation is also important. She considers herself not living alone currently, which might indicate a certain level of social support. Let me think about how this compares to her other characteristics... Given that she's been living with both biological parents in the past and now lives alone, it's possible that these experiences have shaped her social skills and relationships. I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nLastly, I need to consider her gender and ethnicity. She identifies as White, which might influence how judges or parole officers perceive her. However, let me consider the broader implications... Given that she hasn't been convicted yet and has no other significant risk factors, it's challenging to classify her based solely on her race or ethnicity. I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nAfter carefully evaluating each factor, I can now predict 3-year rearrest recidivism based on my analysis. Let me summarize my findings... Based on the weights assigned to each factor and considering their collective impact, I believe that there is a moderate risk of reoffending in the future.\n\nHere's my final assessment:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight due to multiple arrests but no conviction yet.\"),\n    (\"household_size_youth\", \"high\", \"High weight due to lack of individual attention and support from biological parents who may not have been able to provide emotional support.\"),\n    (\"depression_history\", \"low\", \"Low weight as she has not felt depressed in the past month, despite living with potentially unsupportive parents.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Low weight due to high school diploma and lack of college enrollment, but also considering she is not currently pursuing higher education for unknown reasons.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight due to only one job during the year and no indication of instability or reoffending risk related to employment.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\", \"Low weight as she has no current substance use issues or history of addiction.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god_and_life\", \"low\", \"Low weight as her beliefs do not directly indicate a higher risk of reoffending without further context or evidence.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight due to living alone currently, but also considering she has lived with both biological parents in the past.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
