    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider the various risk factors associated with a 21-year-old female who has been arrested multiple times. Let me break down each factor step-by-step and assign a relative weight before predicting her 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's look at her arrest history. She has been arrested nine times and convicted. This is a clear indication of high-risk behavior. So, the arrest count stands out as a significant factor.\n\nNext, I'll consider her conviction status. Since she has been convicted, this adds another layer of risk to her profile. This factor also needs to be considered as high.\n\nNow, let's think about her drug use. She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While this is not a major issue on its own, it does indicate some level of substance abuse, which could be a contributing factor to higher recidivism rates.\n\nLet me check her living situation. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests she lives independently, which might reduce the risk of reoffending due to familial pressures or support systems.\n\nHer educational background is also important. With a high school diploma and no college enrollment, this indicates a lower level of education, which could correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nThe number of jobs she has held in the past year is another factor. She has only held one job, which might suggest instability or lack of financial stability, potentially increasing her risk of reoffending.\n\nHer age and gender are also relevant. At 21 years old, she is a young adult who may still be learning about life and its consequences. Her identification as White and her biological mother's household size could provide some context, but they don't directly impact her recidivism risk.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally indicates a lower level of religiosity, which might not significantly affect her recidivism risk.\n\nLet me summarize these factors:\n\n1. Arrest count: high\n2. Conviction status: high\n3. Drug use (marijuana): medium\n4. Living situation (independent adult): low\n5. Educational background: low\n6. Job stability: low\n7. Age and gender: low\n8. Belief in a higher power: low\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given her arrest history, conviction status, and drug use, it seems likely that she will rearrest within three years. However, other factors like living independently and having a lower educational background might mitigate this risk.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest count\", \"high\", \"her nine arrests and convictions indicate a clear pattern of high-risk behavior\"),\n    (\"conviction status\", \"high\", \"being convicted multiple times suggests a significant increase in recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"past four years of drug use, though not severe, may contribute to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"living situation (independent adult)\", \"low\", \"currently living independently with no familial pressures\"),\n    (\"educational background\", \"low\", \"high school diploma and no college enrollment indicates lower education level\"),\n    (\"job stability\", \"low\", \"only one job in the past year, suggesting instability or lack of financial stability\"),\n    (\"age and gender\", \"low\", \"21-year-old female with no significant familial or social support systems\"),\n    (\"belief in a higher power\", \"low\", \"personal belief that God has nothing to do with her life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
