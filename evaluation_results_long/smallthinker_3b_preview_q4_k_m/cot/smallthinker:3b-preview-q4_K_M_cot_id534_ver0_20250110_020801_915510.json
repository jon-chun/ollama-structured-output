    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for this individual and assign a weight based on its potential impact on their likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. The person has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. This is a significant piece of information because it suggests some level of involvement with the criminal justice system. However, since they haven't been convicted, it doesn't indicate any ongoing criminal activity. So, I'll assign this factor a medium weight. Let me check the reasoning behind this: arrest history can be predictive but isn't always definitive.\n\nNext, the individual's age and racial identity. Being 20 years old and identifying as Black may contribute to certain statistical disparities in recidivism rates. However, these factors alone don't provide enough information to make a strong case for either low or high risk. Therefore, I'll also assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the education level. Holding a high school diploma indicates that the individual has completed their basic education but is not currently enrolled in college. This suggests some level of educational attainment but may not fully capture their future educational or vocational prospects. So, I'll also give this factor a medium weight.\n\nLiving situation and marital status. Currently living alone without being married doesn't seem to significantly impact recidivism risk on its own. Therefore, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nEmployment history is next. The individual has held two jobs during the year, which suggests some level of employment stability and potential for future gainful employment. This factor should also be assigned a medium weight.\n\nSubstance use history. Using drugs in the past four years and experiencing feelings of despair in the past month could indicate higher risk behavior that might contribute to recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign this factor a high weight.\n\nLastly, the individual's belief in God may not directly impact recidivism but could influence other factors such as motivation for rehabilitation or access to support systems. So, I'll also give this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. The combination of drug use and feelings of despair suggests higher risk behavior that might contribute to recidivism. However, the individual's education level and employment history indicate some stability and prospects for future gainful employment. Therefore, I'll predict a high-risk scenario.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet, suggesting involvement with the criminal justice system, but not ongoing criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Age and Racial Identity\", \"low\", \"Being 20 years old and identifying as Black may contribute to certain statistical disparities in recidivism rates, but these factors alone do not provide enough information to make a strong case for either low or high risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Holding a high school diploma indicates completion of basic education but not necessarily higher prospects.

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
