    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully evaluate each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest record and convictions. He has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates a pattern of non-compliance with the law. Given this history, I would rate this as high.\n\nNext, his height and weight are relatively standard for an adult male in the United States. There's no evidence that these factors directly influence his likelihood of reoffending, so I'll classify this as low.\n\nThe fact that he has never been married and is currently not living alone suggests a certain level of independence. However, this doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll also rate this as low.\n\nHis educational background is high school diploma, which is the minimum required for many jobs and indicates some basic literacy and numeracy skills. This factor doesn't directly relate to his likelihood of reoffending, so it's another low.\n\nThe number of jobs he has held in the past year is one. While this could be seen as a lack of stability or skill development, it also suggests he may have found suitable employment quickly. I'll consider this as medium because it indicates some level of employability but not exceptional stability.\n\nHe has not used any drugs for the past four years and has not felt depressed in the past month. These factors are positive indicators that suggest he is currently without substance abuse issues or significant mental health concerns. Therefore, I'll classify this as low.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size 2 at a young age could be seen as a factor related to family dynamics and environment. However, there's no direct evidence linking this to criminal behavior, so I'll rate this as medium because it suggests some level of environmental influence that may need attention but isn't directly tied to reoffending.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a lack of faith in traditional religious or moral frameworks. This could potentially suggest a lower likelihood of engaging in deviant behavior due to societal norms and values being less influential on him. Therefore, I'll classify this as low.\n\nLet me check my reasoning again before making the final prediction and confidence level.\n\nAfter careful consideration, here is the refined answer:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_record\", \"high\", \"Previous arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of non-compliance with the law, indicating a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"There is no evidence that physical characteristics influence an individual's likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Having never been married does not directly correlate with criminal tendencies, as it indicates independence and freedom from certain social pressures.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"A high school diploma suggests some level of education and basic literacy, but there is no direct link to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job in the past year could be seen as a lack of stability or skill development, but it also indicates that he may have found suitable employment quickly.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use and no feelings of depression suggest that substance abuse issues are not influencing his behavior currently.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of size 2 at a young age could indicate family dynamics and environment, but there is no direct link to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally may suggest a lower likelihood of engaging in deviant behavior due to societal norms being less influential.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
