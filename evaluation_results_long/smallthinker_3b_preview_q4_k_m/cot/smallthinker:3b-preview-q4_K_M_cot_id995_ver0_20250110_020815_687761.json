    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old male identified as White, who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the analysis step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. The person has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor, indicating some level of criminal behavior. However, since there was no conviction, it suggests that the situation might have been resolved without legal repercussions. Let me think about this carefully... Given that he hasn't been convicted and there's no clear indication of repeated offenses or serious crime, I'll assign a \"medium\" weight to this factor.\n\nNext, his education level is another important factor. He has never had a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lower likelihood of higher education and employment stability. Let me check... Since he hasn't been in a formal educational setting recently, I'll assign a \"high\" weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's look at his employment history. He has held 3 jobs during the year. While this suggests some level of employment experience, it doesn't necessarily indicate a stable career path or high skill set. Let me think about this... Considering the lack of long-term employment stability and diversity in job roles, I'll assign a \"medium\" weight to this factor.\n\nHis substance use is another critical factor. The person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates potential drug dependence and mental health issues. Let me break this down... Given the repeated drug use and severe emotional state, I'll assign a \"high\" weight to this factor.\n\nHis living situation is also important. He does not live alone and has never been married. However, his current household size is 3, which might indicate some level of dependence on family members. Let me think about this... Considering the dependency on a larger household and the lack of independence, I'll assign a \"medium\" weight to this factor.\n\nHis religious beliefs are another aspect to consider. The person considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a lower likelihood of seeking spiritual support or guidance in times of crisis. Let me check... Given his disbelief in divine intervention, I'll assign a \"low\" weight to this factor.\n\nFinally, his height and weight are relatively average for the population. They don't provide significant insight into risk behavior or lifestyle choices. Let me think about this... These physical attributes won't significantly impact the risk assessment, so I'll assign a \"medium\" weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's compile these factors into a JSON object with a prediction and confidence level:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted. While this is a significant factor, the lack of conviction suggests that the situation may have been resolved without legal repercussions.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"The person has never had a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.
