    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old mixed-race male who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and recidivism history. The person is only 18 years old and has a conviction record. This suggests that his youth might be a mitigating factor, but the presence of a conviction does carry weight. I'll rate this as medium risk because while youth can be protective against recidivism, the conviction itself indicates some level of criminal behavior.\n\nNext, his mixed race identity. While racial identity can influence how he is perceived by law enforcement and society, it doesn't directly translate into increased or decreased risk of recidivism. Therefore, I'll classify this as low risk.\n\nHis height and weight are also relevant. However, these physical attributes do not directly correlate with an individual's propensity for criminal behavior. So, I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nLiving in a large household at a young age could suggest family instability or lack of stability, which might indirectly affect his development and decision-making. But the impact is likely minimal compared to other factors. Thus, I'll classify this as medium risk.\n\nHis educational background\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014is a significant concern. Lack of education can lead to limited job opportunities and potentially higher crime rates among those with lower education levels. This factor will be rated as high risk.\n\nHis unemployment status is another critical factor. Not having held any jobs during the year suggests he may be without gainful employment, which could indicate a lack of structured life and potential for criminal behavior. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years is a serious concern. Past drug use increases the likelihood of future substance-related offenses and potentially violent behavior. This factor will also be rated as high risk.\n\nHis lack of feeling depressed over the past month suggests he might not have any mental health issues, which is important because mental health conditions can influence criminal behavior. However, since this factor does not directly correlate with recidivism, I'll rate it as low risk.\n\nFinally, his statement that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a lack of moral guidance or accountability, which could increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior. This will be rated as medium risk.\n\nLet me summarize my findings and create the JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_and_recidivism_history\", \"medium\", \"Youth can be protective against recidivism, but the presence of a conviction does carry some weight.\"),\n    (\"mixed_race_identity\", \"low\", \"Racial identity generally does not directly correlate with an individual's propensity for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes such as height and weight do not directly influence an individual's likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"large_household_at_young_age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household at a young age may suggest family instability or lack of stability, but this factor is likely to have a minimal impact on recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_high_school_diploma_or_ged\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can lead to limited job opportunities and potentially higher crime rates among those with lower education levels.\"),\n    (\"unemployment_status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can indicate a lack of structured life and potential for criminal behavior, particularly if the individual has not been actively seeking employment.\"),\n    (\"past_drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use increases the likelihood of future substance-related offenses and potentially violent behavior.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_feeling_depressed_over_past_month\", \"low\", \"The absence of depression does not directly correlate with an individual's propensity for criminal behavior, but it may indicate a lack of mental health issues that could influence decision-making.\"),\n    (\"statement_on_god_and_personal_life\", \"medium\", \"A statement indicating a lack of moral guidance or accountability can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
