    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given data and assign a relative weight to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors one by one:\n\n1. **Age**: The individual is 21 years old. This factor alone doesn't seem particularly risky, as age is generally not a significant predictor of future criminal behavior in adulthood. So, I'll assign it a low risk weight.\n   \n   \"Let me check... Age does play a role in juvenile delinquency but not in adulthood. So, 'low' seems appropriate.\"\n\n2. **Race**: The individual identifies as White. Race is not typically a significant factor in predicting criminal behavior based on racial demographics. Thus, I'll also assign it a low risk weight.\n\n   \"Wait a minute... Racial background doesn't influence individual criminal behavior significantly. Low again.\"\n\n3. **Number of Arrests and Convictions**: The person has been arrested 22 times and convicted. This is a significant number of arrests and convictions, indicating a pattern of problematic behavior. I'll assign it a high risk weight.\n\n   \"Hmm... 22 arrests are quite alarming. It suggests a history of problematic behavior.\"\n\n4. **Height and Weight**: The individual's physical attributes don't seem to be relevant to criminal behavior. So, I'll assign them a low risk weight.\n\n   \"Let me think... Physical characteristics aren't typically linked to criminal behavior. Low is fine here.\"\n\n5. **Marital Status**: The person is currently living alone, having never been married. This could indicate independence and potentially a lack of support system. However, it's not directly related to future criminal behavior. I'll assign it a low risk weight.\n\n   \"Wait... Marital status isn't a strong predictor in this context.\"\n\n6. **Education**: The individual has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests limited educational attainment, which could be linked to lower socioeconomic status. Given the correlation between education and criminal behavior, I'll assign it a medium risk weight.\n\n   \"Let me consider... Limited education can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, but it's not directly indicative of future behavior.\"\n\n7. **Employment**: The person has held only 1 job during the year. This is very low employment, which could indicate issues with work ethic and potentially criminal involvement. I'll assign it a high risk weight.\n\n   \"Hmm... Low employment can be a sign of other issues that might lead to criminal behavior.\"\n\n8. **Drug Use**: The individual has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and feels so down that nothing could cheer him up most of the time during the past month. This indicates substance abuse, which is strongly linked to criminal activity. I'll assign it a high risk weight.\n\n   \"Let me think... Substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\"\n\n9. **Lived with Biological Mother**: The person lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2 at a young age. While this could influence family dynamics, it's not directly linked to future criminal behavior. I'll assign it a low risk weight.\n\n   \"Wait... Family background doesn't typically predict adult criminal behavior.\"\n\n10. **Belief in God**: The individual considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a lack of moral compass, which could be linked to higher crime rates. I'll assign it a medium risk weight.\n\n    \"Let me consider... Lack of belief in divine justice might correlate with higher criminal behavior.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these weights to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n- Low: Age, Race, Physical attributes, Marital status\n- Medium: Education, Belief in God\n- High: Number of Arrests and Convictions, Employment, Drug Use\n\nGiven the high number of arrests and convictions, low employment, and substance abuse, I'll predict a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is generally not a significant factor in predicting adult criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Racial background does not typically influence individual criminal behavior based on racial demographics.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are not usually linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are not usually linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marital status is generally not a significant factor in predicting adult criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Limited education can sometimes correlate with lower socioeconomic status, which may be linked to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Low employment can indicate issues with work ethic and potentially lead to criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is strongly correlated with increased likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"lived_with_biological_mother\", \"low\", \"Family background does not typically predict adult criminal behavior based on upbringing.\"),\n    (\"believe_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in divine justice may correlate with higher crime rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
