    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me take a step back and carefully think through the risk assessment process for this individual. I'll break it down into manageable parts and assign weights to each factor before using them to collectively predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's start with the arrest history. The person has been arrested once, which is a significant event. However, since she has also served time in jail for this offense, the weight of this factor might not be as high as one might initially think. Let me check the guidelines again to ensure I'm considering all relevant factors.\n\nNext, her conviction status. This is a crucial piece of information. The fact that she has been convicted suggests a pattern of behavior that could lead to future criminal activity. Given this context, I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nHer physical attributes and living situation are next. At 5 feet 6 inches and weighing between 150 and 174 lbs, her size is within the typical range for adults. Living alone after never being married is also a factor that could influence her behavior. Let me think about how these factors might impact her risk level.\n\nRegarding education and employment, she does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and has held no jobs during the year. This suggests significant gaps in her educational and professional development, which could contribute to her potential for recidivism. I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nHer substance use history is quite detailed. She has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, and some of the time during the past month she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates a pattern of drug use and mental health issues, which are significant risk factors. I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nLastly, her family history and personal beliefs. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 as a child and considers God to have something to do with what happens to her personally. These factors could influence her behavior and decision-making processes. I'll assign a medium weight to these factors.\n\nNow, let's put it all together:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested once, but has also served time in jail for this offense.
