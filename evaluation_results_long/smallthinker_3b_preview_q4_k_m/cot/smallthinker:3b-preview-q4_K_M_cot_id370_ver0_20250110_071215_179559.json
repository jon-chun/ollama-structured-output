    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully evaluate each risk factor for a 19-year-old male named John Doe. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. John has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor indicating a higher risk of recidivism. So, I'll rate this as high.\n\nNext, his conviction status is also important. Given that he has been convicted, it suggests a pattern of criminal behavior. Therefore, this factor should be rated high.\n\nNow, let's think about the age at first offense. John was 19 when arrested, which means he is still young and may not have developed fully as an individual. This could indicate a higher risk of recidivism. So, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHis weight and height don't directly relate to his criminal behavior or recidivism risk, so I'll consider these factors low for now.\n\nLiving alone might suggest independence but doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll rate this factor as low.\n\nJohn has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, which are positive indicators of potential future success. This factor should be rated low.\n\nHis employment history shows he's held two jobs during the year, indicating some stability and adaptability. So, this factor should also be rated low.\n\nThe use of drugs in the past four years could potentially influence his behavior and decision-making processes. However, since it doesn't directly indicate criminal intent or recidivism, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nFeeling depressed over the past month is another important factor. While not directly related to crime, feelings of depression can sometimes be associated with impulsive actions. So, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of size four indicates a potentially stable upbringing environment. This factor should be rated low.\n\nFinally, John's belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is more of an individualistic perspective and doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism risk. So, I'll rate this as low.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors in a JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested once and convicted, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"high\", \"Convicted status suggests a higher risk of recidivism due to past convictions.\"),\n    (\"age_at_first_offense\", \"medium\", \"Being 19 when arrested indicates potential for future recidivism due to age factors.\"),\n    (\"weight_and_height\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone does not necessarily indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment are positive indicators of future success.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Two jobs during the year suggest some stability and adaptability but do not directly correlate with crime or recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use can potentially influence behavior and decision-making processes, but does not directly indicate criminal intent or recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mood_and_depression\", \"medium\", \"Feeling depressed over the past month may suggest potential impulsive behaviors, which could be correlated with crime, but this is speculative and should be considered cautiously.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Household size of four does not directly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may not necessarily indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
