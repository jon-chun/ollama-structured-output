    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully assess the provided information about a 20-year-old male who has been arrested twice but not convicted. He lives alone, has never been married, no high school diploma or GED, and has used drugs in the past four years. Let me break down each risk factor and assign a weight accordingly.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. Having been arrested twice without conviction is concerning but doesn't necessarily indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. However, it does suggest some level of legal issues that could impact future behavior. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNext, his height and weight are relatively standard for his age and gender. There's no indication that these factors contribute significantly to his risk profile beyond basic physical characteristics. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nHis living situation is described as being alone, which might suggest some level of isolation but doesn't directly impact his risk assessment. Therefore, I'll also rate this as low.\n\nThe fact that he has never been married and is currently living alone could indicate a lack of social support network. This is something to consider when evaluating his potential for recidivism. So, I'll assign a medium weight here.\n\nHis educational background is limited, with no high school diploma or GED certificate, and he's not enrolled in college. This suggests that he might be at risk of unemployment due to his lack of formal education. Therefore, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year, which could indicate some level of employability but also suggest a history of job-hopping. This factor is somewhat mixed and should be rated as medium.\n\nHis drug use in the past four years, primarily marijuana, does not significantly impact his risk profile beyond indicating potential substance abuse issues. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nThe fact that he has felt down in the dumps during the past month suggests emotional distress but doesn't necessarily indicate criminal intent. Therefore, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHis upbringing with a biological mother and household of size 3 in a rural area is somewhat neutral and doesn't directly impact his risk profile beyond providing context to his background. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a lack of moral guidance but doesn't necessarily contribute to a high-risk assessment. Therefore, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNow, let's put all these factors together and make a prediction based on the collective risk scores.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested twice without conviction may suggest some level of legal issues that could impact future behavior.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"There is no indication that these factors contribute significantly to his risk profile beyond basic physical characteristics.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"low\", \"Being alone does not directly impact his risk profile, but it may indicate a lack of social support network.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never been married and living alone may suggest a lack of social support network, which could be a factor in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate, and not enrolled in college may indicate some level of unemployment due to his educational background.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs during the year suggests some level of employability, but also a history of job-hopping which could be indicative of instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Primarily marijuana use in the past four years does not significantly impact his risk profile beyond indicating potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Upbringing with biological mother and household of size 3 in a rural area is somewhat neutral and doesn't directly impact his risk profile.\"),\n    (\"faith_and_causality\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally may indicate a lack of moral guidance, which could be a factor in recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
