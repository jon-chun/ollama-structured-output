    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me first carefully analyze each risk factor for this individual and assign a relative weight to it before using them collectively to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. I'll break down my thought process step by step.\n\nLet's start with the arrest history:\n- The person has been arrested once but has not been convicted.\n- This is a critical factor, as conviction history strongly correlates with future criminal behavior.\n- Wait, let me think... Even though she hasn't been convicted, this still indicates a past pattern of illegal activity. It's crucial to consider this in the risk assessment.\n- Therefore, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNext, her biological mother's influence:\n- She lived with her biological mother for an extended period.\n- This suggests potential social and environmental factors that could affect her behavior.\n- Let me check... Living with parents can significantly impact one's life choices, especially at a young age.\n- I'll assign this factor a medium weight as well.\n\nNow, the drug use:\n- She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine).\n- This indicates current substance abuse, which is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n- Wait a minute... Substance abuse can lead to reckless behavior and poor decision-making.\n- Therefore, I'll assign this factor a high weight.\n\nHer living situation:\n- She currently lives alone after being raised in a household of size 2.\n- This could indicate independence issues or potential social isolation.\n- Let me think... Living alone might not necessarily be a risk factor; however, it's an important consideration for understanding her current life circumstances.\n- I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nEducation and employment status:\n- She has a high school diploma but is currently enrolled in college and has no jobs.\n- This suggests limited vocational skills and potentially higher recidivism rates due to unemployment.\n- Wait, let me check... Unemployment can lead to feelings of frustration and desperation, which might drive individuals towards criminal activities.\n- Therefore, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nDepression:\n- She hasn't felt depressed over the past month.\n- This is a positive factor as it indicates her current mental state is not influenced by depression.\n- Let me think... Depression can be a significant risk factor for recidivism due to its impact on decision-making and motivation.\n- Therefore, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHer belief in God:\n- She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n- This is an interesting factor, but it's difficult to quantify its direct impact on future behavior.\n- Wait a minute... Faith can provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, potentially reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n- Therefore, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nFinally, her physical attributes:\n- She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 135 lbs.\n- These are common physical characteristics with no direct correlation to future behavior.\n- Let me check... Physical traits do not typically influence recidivism rates based on available data.\n- Therefore, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let's compile the risk factors:\n- Arrest history: Medium\n- Influence of biological mother: Medium\n- Drug use: High\n- Living situation: Low\n- Education and employment status: Medium\n- Depression: Low\n- Belief in God: Low\n- Physical attributes: Low\n\nWith these weights in mind, I'll predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism rate:\n- Based on the analysis, a high probability of future criminal behavior can be inferred.\n- Therefore, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 85%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate past patterns of illegal activity, but it's not sufficient to predict future behavior.\"),\n    (\"influence_of_biological_mother\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother may influence her behavior, but the extent is unclear due to limited data on this specific factor.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use indicates current substance abuse, which can lead to reckless behavior and poor decision-making.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone after being raised in a household of size 2 does not necessarily indicate higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Enrolled in college with no jobs may suggest limited vocational skills, which can lead to unemployment and potential recidivism due to frustration or desperation.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression indicates a stable mental state and lower likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Considering God's role in personal life is an interesting factor but lacks direct correlation with recidivism rates based on available data.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly influence recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
