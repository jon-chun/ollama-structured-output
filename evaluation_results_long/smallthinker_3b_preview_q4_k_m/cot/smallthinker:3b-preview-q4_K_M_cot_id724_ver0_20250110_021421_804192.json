    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign a relative weight to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested 8 times and convicted. This is a significant number of arrests over time, indicating a pattern of behavior that may increase his risk of future criminal activity. Let me think about this carefully... Given the frequency and recency of these arrests, I would assign this factor as high.\n\nNext, let's look at his conviction history. He has been convicted, which is a clear indication of past criminal behavior. However, compared to the arrest history, it might not be as weighty in predicting future crimes. Wait, let me check... Considering all factors, I will assign this as medium.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical attributes. His height and weight are within normal ranges, with no specific indicators suggesting increased risk of violence or substance abuse. This factor seems to have a low impact on the prediction.\n\nFor his marital status, he is not married and lives alone. This does not seem to directly correlate with higher crime rates. So, I will assign this as low.\n\nHis educational background shows that he has a GED certificate but is not enrolled in college. While education can be a mitigating factor, it doesn't significantly impact his risk level. Therefore, I will assign this as medium.\n\nHis employment history indicates that he has held 2 jobs during the year. This suggests some stability and work ethic, which might slightly reduce his risk of crime. So, I will assign this as low.\n\nRegarding his drug use, he has used marijuana in the past four years but does not feel depressed currently. This factor seems to have a low impact on the prediction.\n\nFor his living situation, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4 at a young age. While there might be some family dynamics at play, this factor is relatively low in terms of its direct influence on future criminal behavior.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests that he does not attribute personal issues to divine intervention. This factor seems to have no significant impact on the prediction.\n\nFinally, his general health and well-being are described as good, with no specific indicators suggesting increased risk of violence or substance abuse. Therefore, I will assign this as low.\n\nAfter all these considerations, let me summarize:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested multiple times and convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that may increase his risk of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"While the individual has a conviction history, it is not as significant as his arrest history in predicting future crime.
