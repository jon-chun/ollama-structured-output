    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider each risk factor and assign a weight to it based on its potential impact on the individual's likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors one by one:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested four times and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\n2. **Age and Race**: At 19 years old and identifying as Black, there are racial disparities that might influence recidivism rates.\n3. **Physical Characteristics**: Height and weight range aren't directly relevant to recidivism but could be considered if there's evidence linking physical attributes to criminal behavior.\n4. **Marital Status**: Living alone suggests a certain level of independence that might affect how they interact with the criminal justice system.\n5. **Education and Employment History**: A high school diploma and one job over the past year indicate limited education and employment stability.\n6. **Drug Use**: Past four years of marijuana use, plus recent feelings of depression, suggest potential substance abuse issues or mental health concerns that could influence behavior.\n7. **Adoption Background**: Living with adoptive parents in a household of size 4 suggests a potentially unstable upbringing, which might have influenced the individual's life trajectory.\n8. **Belief in Divine Intervention**: The belief that God has nothing to do with personal matters is neutral and doesn't directly impact recidivism.\n\nLet me check each factor again:\n\n- Arrest History: High (Given multiple arrests and convictions)\n- Age and Race: Medium (There are racial disparities, but age alone isn't a strong predictor)\n- Physical Characteristics: Low (Height and weight range aren't significant factors in recidivism)\n- Marital Status: Low (Living alone doesn't directly correlate to recidivism)\n- Education and Employment History: Medium (Limited education and employment history could indicate instability)\n- Drug Use: High (Current drug use, even if not consistently used, and recent feelings of depression suggest a higher risk)\n- Adoption Background: Low (Adoption status isn't strongly linked to recidivism)\n- Belief in Divine Intervention: Low (Neutral factor)\n\nNow, let's assign the weights:\n\n1. Arrest History: High\n2. Age and Race: Medium\n3. Physical Characteristics: Low\n4. Marital Status: Low\n5. Education and Employment History: Medium\n6. Drug Use: High\n7. Adoption Background: Low\n8. Belief in Divine Intervention: Low\n\nLet's put this all together into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age and Race\", \"medium\", \"Racial disparities exist, but age alone doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight range aren't directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone isn't a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Limited education and employment history may indicate instability, but this is not a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Current drug use and recent feelings of depression suggest potential substance abuse or mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Adoption Background\", \"low\", \"Adoption status isn't strongly linked to recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Belief in Divine Intervention\", \"low\", \"This belief doesn't directly impact the individual's likelihood of committing a crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his adoptive parent(s) in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
