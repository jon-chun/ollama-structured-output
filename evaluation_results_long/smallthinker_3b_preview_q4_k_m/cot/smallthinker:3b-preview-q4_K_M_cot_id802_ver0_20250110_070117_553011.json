    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested once but is not convicted. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. The individual has been arrested once but is not convicted. This suggests that while there has been some contact with the legal system, it may not be indicative of a high-risk behavior pattern. Therefore, I will assign \"low\" to the factor of arrest history.\n\nNext, let's think about substance use. The person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and recently felt down for an extended period. This indicates that there may be underlying mental health issues or substance abuse issues that could impact behavior. However, I will rate this as \"medium\" because it suggests a need for attention but not necessarily a high-risk level.\n\nNow, let's consider the living situation. The individual has lived with both biological parents and is currently alone. While this indicates some family history, there are no specific risk factors related to housing that stand out. Therefore, I will assign \"low\" to the factor of living situation.\n\nNext, let's think about education and employment. The person has a high school diploma and has held two jobs during the year. This suggests that he is not currently in a low-education or unemployed status but also doesn't have extensive academic or vocational training. Therefore, I will assign \"medium\" to the factor of education and employment.\n\nNow, let's consider family background. The individual lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in an urban area. This suggests some family history but no specific risk factors related to living conditions or family dynamics that stand out. Therefore, I will assign \"low\" to the factor of family background.\n\nFinally, let's think about religious beliefs. The person considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a lack of faith in traditional religious authority, but it does not necessarily indicate a high-risk behavior pattern. Therefore, I will assign \"medium\" to the factor of religious beliefs.\n\nLet me check my analysis again and make sure all factors are covered:\n\n- Arrest History: Low\n- Substance Use: Medium\n- Living Situation: Low\n- Education and Employment: Medium\n- Family Background: Low\n- Religious Beliefs: Medium\n\nNow, let's combine these risk factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. Based on the analysis, there is a moderate likelihood of the individual committing a crime in the next three years due to the presence of some substance use and limited education and employment history.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction does not necessarily indicate high-risk behavior. However, it is a factor to consider in risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used drugs in the past four years and recently felt down for an extended period, indicating possible substance abuse or mental health issues that may impact behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in an urban area. No specific risk factors related to housing are evident.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"Has a high school diploma and has held two jobs during the year. However, no extensive academic or vocational training is evident, suggesting some limitations in education and employment history.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. No specific risk factors related to family background are evident.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Has a non-traditional view regarding God's role in personal life, but this does not necessarily indicate high-risk behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
