    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully assess each risk factor for a 21-year-old Black female who has been arrested once but not convicted. She is married, lives with her spouse, holds a GED, has no job history in the past year, and reports being drug-free and mentally healthy over the last four years. Additionally, she grew up in a household of four, living with her biological mother in an urban area, and considers God's role in her life.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Age**: At 21, there is still significant room for growth and development. This factor does not significantly impact the risk profile.\n   - Risk Factor: Age\n   - Weight: low\n\n2. **Racial Identity**: Being Black in the United States can influence social and economic factors. However, it does not necessarily increase or decrease the likelihood of criminal behavior without additional context.\n   - Risk Factor: Racial Identity\n   - Weight: low\n\n3. **Previous Arrests**: The individual has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a relatively minor offense with no conviction record.\n   - Risk Factor: Previous Arrests\n   - Weight: medium (Note: A single arrest without conviction does not significantly impact the risk profile.)\n\n4. **Marital Status**: Being married and living with her spouse can provide support and stability, which may mitigate some risks.\n   - Risk Factor: Marital Status\n   - Weight: low\n\n5. **Education Level**: Holding a GED is equivalent to completing high school, indicating some level of education. This does not significantly impact the risk profile.\n   - Risk Factor: Education Level\n   - Weight: low\n\n6. **Employment History**: No jobs in the past year could indicate unemployment or non-employment issues. However, this factor alone does not significantly contribute to the risk profile without additional context.\n   - Risk Factor: Employment History\n   - Weight: medium (Note: Unemployment may be a contributing factor but is not significant on its own.)\n\n7. **Substance Use**: The individual has not used drugs in the past four years, indicating stable behavior.\n   - Risk Factor: Substance Use\n   - Weight: low\n\n8. **Mental Health**: Reporting no depression over the past month suggests stable mental health.\n   - Risk Factor: Mental Health\n   - Weight: low\n\n9. **Family Background**: Growing up in a household of four with her biological mother in an urban area can influence social and economic factors but does not significantly impact the risk profile without additional context.\n   - Risk Factor: Family Background\n   - Weight: low (Note: Urban upbringing and family structure may have some impact, but it is relatively minor.)\n\n10. **Spiritual Beliefs**: Considering God's role in her life can influence behavior and decision-making but does not significantly impact the risk profile without additional context.\n    - Risk Factor: Spiritual Beliefs\n    - Weight: low (Note: This factor has a very slight influence on behavior, but it is negligible.)\n\nNow, let me combine these factors to make a collective prediction:\n\n- Low-risk factors: Age, Racial Identity, Previous Arrests (without conviction), Marital Status, Education Level, Substance Use, Mental Health, Family Background\n- Medium-risk factors: Employment History\n\nGiven the low-risk nature of most factors and the moderate unemployment issue, I will assign a medium risk profile. However, since the overall risk is relatively low, I will lean towards a \"NO\" prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"At 21, there is still significant room for growth and development.\"),\n    (\"Racial Identity\", \"low\", \"Being Black in the United States can influence social and economic factors, but it does not necessarily increase or decrease the likelihood of criminal behavior without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrests\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction does not significantly impact the risk profile.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with her spouse can provide support and stability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Holding a GED is equivalent to completing high school, indicating some level of education.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"No jobs in the past year could indicate unemployment or non-employment issues.
