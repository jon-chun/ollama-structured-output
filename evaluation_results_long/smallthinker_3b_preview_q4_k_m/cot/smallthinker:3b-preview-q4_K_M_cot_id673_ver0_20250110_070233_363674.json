    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the analysis step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest and conviction history. The person has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor that indicates a pattern of behavior potentially leading to criminal activity. Given this information, I would assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNext, I'll look at his current age and physical attributes. Being 20 years old and male does not inherently increase the risk of recidivism beyond other factors like socioeconomic status. So, I'll rate this as \"low.\"\n\nHis occupation is another important factor. Currently living alone without any jobs during the year suggests a lack of financial stability and social support. This could be a significant risk factor leading to criminal activity in pursuit of income or survival. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"high.\"\n\nThe length of his educational attainment is also relevant. Having a high school diploma but not being enrolled in college indicates limited formal education, which may affect his employability and future prospects. This suggests a moderate level of risk, so I'll rate it as \"medium.\"\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a large household as a child could influence his socialization and family dynamics. However, since he considers God irrelevant to personal experiences, this factor seems less impactful. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nHis substance use is another critical factor. Using drugs over the past four years, albeit not recently, and having no feelings of depression in the past month suggests a pattern of substance abuse that may be linked to criminal behavior. Given his recent arrest, this risk seems high.\n\nFinally, his personal beliefs regarding God are irrelevant to predicting recidivism based on available information. This factor will be rated as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's compile these assessments and make a collective prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrested once and convicted\", \"high\", \"Recent arrest history suggests a pattern of behavior potentially leading to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age and male\", \"low\", \"No significant indicators of increased risk beyond other factors.\"),\n    (\"current living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone without jobs may lead to financial instability, potentially influencing criminal behavior in pursuit of income or survival.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college indicates limited formal education, which may affect employability and future prospects.\"),\n    (\"living with both parents as a child\", \"low\", \"Limited impact on recidivism based on available information.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"Recent substance abuse history suggests potential involvement in criminal activity to support addiction or financial needs.\"),\n    (\"personal beliefs about God\", \"low\", \"Irrelevant to predicting recidivism based on available information.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5.
