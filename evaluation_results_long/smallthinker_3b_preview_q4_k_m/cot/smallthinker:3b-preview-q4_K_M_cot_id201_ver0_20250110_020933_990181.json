    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully evaluate each risk factor for the 20-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her demographic factors:\n- Age: 20 years old.\n- Household size: 4 (as a child).\n- Marital status: Not married.\n- Educational attainment: No high school diploma or GED certificate.\n- Employment history: Held 3 jobs during the year.\n- Substance use: No drug use in the past four years, but she has felt down recently.\n\nNext, let's look at her behavioral and attitudinal factors:\n- Substance use history.\n- Spiritual beliefs.\n- Current living situation (currently not living alone).\n\nLet me break this down further. For substance use, it's important to note that she has no drug use in the past four years, which is a positive sign. However, feeling down recently suggests potential mental health issues.\n\nFor household size and living arrangement, her past experience with a larger household could indicate resilience, but it also suggests instability. Living alone currently adds another layer of complexity.\n\nSpiritual beliefs are significant. The belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally might influence her behavior positively, indicating potential self-regulation.\n\nNow, let's assign weights based on these observations:\n\n1. Age: Low risk due to the arrest but no conviction.\n2. Household size and living arrangement: Medium risk because of past instability and current living situation.\n3. Marital status: Low risk as she is not married.\n4. Educational attainment: High risk due to lack of high school diploma or GED certificate.\n5. Employment history: Medium risk for a female with only 3 jobs in a year, but no conviction.\n6. Substance use history: Low risk for no drug use in the past four years.\n7. Mental health concerns: Medium risk based on feeling down recently.\n8. Spiritual beliefs: Medium risk due to potential self-regulation.\n\nLet's compile this into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The subject is young, but no conviction in the arrest suggests limited criminal history and potential for change.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Past experience with larger household indicates resilience, but current living situation adds complexity.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not married, indicating a stable environment\"),\n    (\"educational_attainment\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate suggests limited education and potential barriers to rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held 3 jobs in a year but no conviction; indicates some employment experience but possibly not fully committed to education or career development.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, indicating positive behavior change\"),\n    (\"mental_health_concerns\", \"medium\", \"Felt down recently suggests potential mental health issues and may impact risk assessment\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence indicates possible self-regulation but also raises questions about external support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis JSON object reflects the detailed analysis of each factor, providing a comprehensive risk assessment for this individual.",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 160 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
