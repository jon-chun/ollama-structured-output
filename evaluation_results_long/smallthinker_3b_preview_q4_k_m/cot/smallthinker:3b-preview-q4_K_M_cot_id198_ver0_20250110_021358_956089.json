    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Let me break down the factors one by one and assign them appropriate weights.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice and convicted. This is significant because it indicates a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity. Given this information, I would rate this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNext, his conviction. Being convicted suggests a clear intent or past actions that led to legal consequences. This factor also deserves a weight of \"high.\"\n\nHis educational background and employment status are less directly related to criminal risk but still important. He has completed a Bachelor's degree and is enrolled in college, which generally indicates a higher likelihood of future success and reduced criminal activity. His job history shows only one job held during the year, which might suggest instability. However, given his academic pursuits, I would rate this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nHis drug use history is another critical factor. Using drugs in the past four years can be indicative of potential criminal behavior related to substance trafficking or distribution. Given this, I would assign a \"high\" weight to this factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents and having experienced multiple life changes at a young age might suggest resilience but could also indicate a history of environmental stressors that could influence future behavior. I would rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nThe influence of religion is unique and less directly related to criminal risk factors. However, it's important to consider how deeply someone believes in their faith can impact their decision-making. Given this, I would assign a \"low\" weight to this factor.\n\nHis current living situation being solitary might suggest a lack of social support, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a higher likelihood of future crime. Therefore, I would rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. Based on the weighted analysis, the overall risk seems moderate to high.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The two arrests and conviction suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted indicates a clear intent or past actions that led to legal consequences.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"Completed Bachelor's degree and enrollment in college suggest higher likelihood of future success, but one job held during the year may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Using drugs in the past four years can be indicative of potential criminal behavior related to substance trafficking or distribution.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents and experiencing multiple life changes at a young age might suggest resilience, but could also indicate environmental stressors influencing future behavior.\"),\n    (\"religious_influence\", \"low\", \"The influence of religion is less directly related to criminal risk factors, but may impact decision-making in unique ways.\"),\n    (\"current_living_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone currently does not necessarily indicate a higher likelihood of future crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
