    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the situation step by step. I need to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors and think about their implications:\n\n1. **Male Age**: The person is 20 years old.\n   - Let me check... Being young can indeed pose higher risks due to impulsivity and potential learning opportunities in education and employment. I'll assign this a medium weight (M).\n\n2. **Unconvicted Arrest**:\n   - Wait, let me think about this... An unconvicted arrest does indicate some level of criminal behavior, but the lack of conviction suggests that he may be responsive to rehabilitation. I'll go with a low weight (L) here.\n\n3. **Height and Weight**: These physical attributes don't directly correlate with criminal risk.\n   - Let me consider this carefully... No direct relevance means a low weight (L).\n\n4. **Marital Status**:\n   - Single, living alone...\n   - This doesn't directly impact crime risk, so I'll assign it a low weight (L).\n\n5. **Education Level**: He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college.\n   - Education generally reduces criminal activity... So, this should be a medium weight (M).\n\n6. **Employment History**:\n   - Holding two jobs during the year...\n   - Employment can indicate stability and reduced crime risk, so I'll assign it a medium weight (M).\n\n7. **Drug Use**:\n   - Used drugs in the past four years...\n   - Drug use is often associated with higher crime rates... This should be a high weight (H).\n\n8. **Depression**:\n   - Hasn't felt depressed over the past month...\n   - Lack of depression suggests lower risk... So, this will be a low weight (L).\n\n9. **Previous Residence**:\n   - Lived with biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area...\n   - Urban living can affect crime rates, so I'll assign it a medium weight (M).\n\n10. **Belief in God**:\n    - Believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally...\n    - This belief might influence behavior but doesn't directly correlate with crime risk... So, this will be a low weight (L).\n\nNow, let's compile these weights and make a prediction:\n\n- Factors: [Male Age, Unconvicted Arrest, Height and Weight, Marital Status, Education Level, Employment History, Drug Use, Depression, Previous Residence, Belief in God]\n- Weights: [M, L, L, L, M, M, H, L, M, L]\n\nLet me think about the collective risk score... Given the mix of medium and high weights, I'll predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism as \"YES\" with a confidence level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Male Age\", \"medium\", \"Being young can indeed pose higher risks due to impulsivity and potential learning opportunities in education and employment.\"),\n    (\"Unconvicted Arrest\", \"low\", \"An unconvicted arrest does indicate some level of criminal behavior, but the lack of conviction suggests that he may be responsive to rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with criminal risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Single, living alone...
