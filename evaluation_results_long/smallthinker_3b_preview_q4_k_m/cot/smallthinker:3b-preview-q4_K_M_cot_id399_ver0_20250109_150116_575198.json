    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about each factor step by step and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] before using them collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's start with his age and gender. A young age might suggest vulnerability, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk of recidivism. I'll consider this as a low-risk factor.\n\nNext, the arrest without conviction. While not convicted, the fact that he has been arrested once is a significant indicator of potential recidivism. This should be a medium-risk factor.\n\nPhysical characteristics are generally not predictive of criminal behavior, so I'll classify this as a low-risk factor.\n\nLiving alone and being unmarried don't typically correlate with increased crime risk, so these factors will also be low in weight.\n\nLack of education is often associated with higher recidivism rates. Given that he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college, this should be a medium-risk factor.\n\nUnemployment for the year might suggest difficulty finding employment, but it's not directly linked to crime risk. I'll consider this as a low-risk factor.\n\nSubstance use is a strong indicator of increased recidivism risk, especially with past drug use and current substance abuse. This should be a high-risk factor.\n\nCurrent mental health status indicates no depression over the past month, which reduces the risk of recidivism. This will be a low-risk factor.\n\nLiving in a household of size 5 is not directly linked to crime risk, so I'll classify this as a low-risk factor.\n\nBelief in God's influence might provide some insight into personal values and behaviors, but it doesn't typically impact recidivism rates. This will also be a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors:\n\n- Arrest without conviction (medium)\n- Physical characteristics (low)\n- Living alone (low)\n- Unemployment (low)\n- Substance use (high)\n- Current mental health status (low)\n- Household size (low)\n- Belief in God's influence (low)\n\nCollectively, the high-risk factor for substance use is a significant indicator of increased recidivism risk. Therefore, my prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 80.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age and gender\", \"low\", \"A young age may suggest vulnerability, but it does not necessarily indicate an increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"While not convicted, the fact that he has been arrested once is a significant indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are generally not predictive of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living alone and unmarried\", \"low\", \"Living alone and being unmarried do not typically correlate with increased crime risk.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"medium\", \"A lack of high school diploma or GED certificate may indicate difficulties in finding employment, but it is not directly linked to crime risk.\"),\n    (\"unemployment for the year\", \"low\", \"Unemployment for the year might suggest difficulty in finding employment, but it does not necessarily increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Past drug use and current substance abuse are strong indicators of increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"current mental health status\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month indicates a low risk of recidivism due to stable mental health.\"),\n    (\"living in a household of size 5\", \"low\", \"Household size is not directly linked to crime risk.\"),\n    (\"belief in God's influence\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence might provide some insight into personal values and behaviors, but it does not typically impact recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
