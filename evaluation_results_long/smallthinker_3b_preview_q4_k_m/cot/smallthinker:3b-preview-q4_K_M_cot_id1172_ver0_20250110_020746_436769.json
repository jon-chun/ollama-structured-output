    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant factor. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest and conviction history. This is clearly a major concern. The more arrests someone has, the higher their risk of future offenses. Given that he has already had one arrest and conviction, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNext, his age and gender. Being 19 years old and male, there are specific considerations here. Younger males often face different challenges compared to older individuals or females. However, the data suggests that being Black at a young age can increase risk due to systemic factors. Given these details, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his living situation and family history. He is currently living alone with parents from a household of size 4. Living with parents who have experienced similar issues might influence behavior. However, the specific circumstances here are not as clear-cut as in other areas, so I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nEducation and employment status are also important factors. He has only recently received a GED certificate and is currently unemployed. This suggests that he may be at risk of engaging in high-risk behaviors due to a lack of structured life path. Given his current situation, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While not every user will become an offender, the presence of substance use does increase risk. However, it's important to note that he has not felt depressed over the past month, which might mitigate some risks. I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nPersonal beliefs and attitudes are also worth considering. His belief in God having something to do with what happens to him personally suggests a strong sense of spirituality or divine intervention. While faith can sometimes provide support, it may not necessarily protect against risky behaviors. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nFinally, his living situation at a young age could influence how he navigates life and potential risks. However, the specific circumstances here are less clear-cut compared to other factors, so I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nAfter careful consideration, here is my analysis in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"A single arrest and conviction significantly increase risk of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"age/gender\", \"medium\", \"Young male Black individual may face unique challenges due to age and gender, but the presence of a household with similar issues may influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation/family history\", \"low\", \"Living alone with parents from a larger household does not provide clear-cut risk indicators.\"),\n    (\"education/employment\", \"medium\", \"No recent education or employment could lead to high-risk behaviors due to lack of structured life path, but his current unemployment may not necessarily increase risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of marijuana use does increase risk, but he has not felt depressed over the past month, mitigating some risks.\"),\n    (\"personal beliefs/attitudes\", \"low\", \"Belief in God having something to do with personal experiences may provide support or a sense of meaning, potentially reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
