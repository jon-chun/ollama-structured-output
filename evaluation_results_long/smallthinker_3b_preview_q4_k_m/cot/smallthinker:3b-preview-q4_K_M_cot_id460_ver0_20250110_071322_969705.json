    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 20 years old and being male, this is generally not a significant risk factor for recidivism. So, I'll assign \"low\" to this factor.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but not convicted. This could indicate some level of criminal behavior, so I'll go with \"medium\".\n\nHe is White, which is unlikely to be a significant risk factor. So, \"low\" again.\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight don't typically influence recidivism. Therefore, \"low\".\n\nBeing single and not living alone might suggest a lack of familial support, but it's not directly linked to recidivism. I'll assign \"medium\".\n\nHe has a GED and is not in college, which doesn't seem to impact his likelihood of reoffending. So, \"low\".\n\nHe has held four jobs, which could indicate employment stability or instability. Given the context, I think \"low\" is appropriate.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. This suggests substance use, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Therefore, \"high\".\n\nHaving not felt depressed over the past month might suggest lower mental health concerns, so \"low\".\n\nGrowing up with six people in an urban household could indicate some level of socio-economic disadvantage or exposure to crime, but it's not directly linked to recidivism. I'll assign \"medium\".\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally might suggest a lack of personal responsibility or accountability, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Therefore, \"high\".\n\nNow, let me summarize and make a prediction based on these weights.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20-year-old male, no significant evidence of age-related risks\"),\n    (\"arrested but not convicted\", \"medium\", \"has been arrested once, indicating some level of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White, no direct correlation with recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes are unlikely to influence recidivism\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"single, not living alone, may indicate lack of familial support\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"GED holder, not enrolled in college, no direct correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"held four jobs, suggests some employment stability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"hasn't felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"grew up with six people in an urban household\"),\n    (\"personal philosophy\", \"high\", \"believes God has nothing to do with personal matters\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
