    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider each risk factor for the 20-year-old male identified as White. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the criminal justice system, which could potentially increase the risk of future arrests. However, since he hasn't been convicted, I'll assign it a low weight.\n\nNext, his height and weight are straightforward physical characteristics that don't directly influence crime risk. So, I'll assign these factors a low weight as well.\n\nLiving in an urban area is another factor. Living in urban areas can sometimes be associated with higher levels of criminal activity, but since he has never been convicted, this factor will also get a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his educational background. He has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests that he hasn't pursued further education or training beyond high school, which could limit his career opportunities and potential for higher-paying jobs. However, given his low conviction rate, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nHis employment history is also important. He has held two jobs during the year. While having multiple jobs might suggest some level of stability and employability, it doesn't directly correlate with crime risk. So, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nDrug use in the past four years is another significant factor. Using drugs can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, but since he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, his likelihood of engaging in violent or property crimes might be lower. However, given his conviction history, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nHis living situation and family background are also important. Living with both parents and having experienced multiple family members could potentially influence his behavior, but since he hasn't been convicted, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nFinally, his belief in God might have some impact on his decision-making processes, but given that he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, this factor will also get a low weight.\n\nNow, let's summarize these factors and their weights:\n\n1. Arrested once (not convicted): Low\n2. Height: Low\n3. Weight: Low\n4. Urban area living: Low\n5. High school diploma: Medium\n6. Two jobs during the year: Low\n7. Used drugs in the past four years: Medium\n8. Living with both parents: Low\n9. Belief in God: Low\n\nLet me think about how these factors collectively predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism risk. Given that he has a low conviction rate and multiple job holdings, but also uses drugs and has used them in the past four years, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nSo, my prediction based on these factors is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested once (not convicted)\", \"low\", \"A single arrest not leading to conviction suggests a low risk of future arrests.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics do not directly influence crime risk.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Similar to height, weight is unrelated to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Urban area living\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban area may slightly increase risk due to higher crime rates, but conviction history mitigates this factor.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma\", \"medium\", \"Lack of further education and employment stability suggests a medium level of risk.\"),\n    (\"Two jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Multiple job holdings do not necessarily correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Used drugs in the past four years\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can sometimes lead to criminal activity, but conviction history suggests low risk.\"),\n    (\"Living with both parents\", \"low\", \"Family background is generally unrelated to crime risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Personal beliefs are unlikely to directly influence crime risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis prediction reflects a careful analysis of each factor and its impact on the overall risk assessment.",
