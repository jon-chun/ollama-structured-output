    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider each risk factor and assign a relative weight to it before using them collectively to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism of the individual in question. Let's break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let me think about the arrest history. The person has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. This is an important factor because it shows a pattern of behavior that may indicate criminal tendencies. However, since it hasn't led to a conviction, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNext, her age and gender. Being 19 years old and female might suggest certain vulnerabilities or patterns related to juvenile justice, but overall, it doesn't significantly impact the recidivism prediction. So, I'll classify this as low.\n\nHeight and weight are not directly relevant to criminal behavior in most cases, so I'll assign a very low weight here as well.\n\nMarital status is another factor. Not being married might suggest certain living conditions or support systems, but it doesn't have a direct link to recidivism. So, again, this will be classified as low.\n\nEducation level and employment history are crucial. Without a high school diploma or GED and no job experience, this person has limited social and economic resources, which can influence their behavior. I'll assign a medium weight here.\n\nDrugs and substance abuse is another critical factor. The fact that she hasn't used drugs in the past four years suggests a clean record, but her recent feelings of depression might indicate underlying mental health issues. This will be classified as low due to the lack of direct criminal behavior.\n\nLiving environment and family history can provide insights into childhood trauma or support systems. Living with two biological parents in a large household might suggest some level of familial support, but the specific mention of living with both parents doesn't directly correlate to recidivism. So, this will be classified as low.\n\nPersonal beliefs and spirituality are generally not predictive of criminal behavior, so I'll assign a very low weight here.\n\nFinally, overall confidence in the prediction is subjective but based on the analysis above, I would say it's medium.\n\nNow, let me summarize all these factors into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"The fact that she has been arrested once but not convicted indicates some level of criminal behavior, but given her age and other factors, this is relatively low impact on recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age and Gender\", \"low\", \"Being 19 years old and female may suggest certain vulnerabilities or patterns related to juvenile justice, but this factor does not significantly impact the prediction of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"very_low\", \"Physical attributes such as height and weight are generally not predictive of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Not being married may suggest some level of independence or support system, but this is not directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Limited education and no job experience may indicate a lack of social and economic resources that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drugs and Substance Abuse\", \"low\", \"The fact that she has not used drugs in the past four years suggests a clean record, but her recent feelings of depression may indicate underlying mental health issues not directly related to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Environment and Family History\", \"low\", \"Living with two biological parents in a large household may suggest some level of familial support, but this factor does not significantly impact recidivism prediction.\"),\n    (\"Personal Beliefs and Spirituality\", \"very_low\", \"Belief systems and spirituality are generally not predictive of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs between 100 and 124 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
