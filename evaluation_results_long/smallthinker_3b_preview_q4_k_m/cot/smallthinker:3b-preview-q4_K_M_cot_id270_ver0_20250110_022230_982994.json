    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each factor and consider its impact on the individual's likelihood of reoffending within three years. Let me break down the factors one by one.\n\nFirst, let's look at his arrest history. He has been arrested twice and convicted once. This is a significant part of his criminal record. Given that he has had multiple encounters with the legal system, I would rate this factor as \"high.\" The recency and frequency of these incidents suggest a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 18 years old, he is still a minor in many jurisdictions, which might impact the severity of sentencing or parole conditions. However, his male identity does not directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I would rate this factor as \"low.\"\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward. His height and weight do not suggest any particular risk factors related to violence or substance abuse, so I would rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nMarital status is another factor. Since he is currently living alone, without a spouse, his living situation does not directly correlate with criminal behavior. However, the lack of a spouse might indicate some level of independence and potentially a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors for personal gain, so I would rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nHis educational status is also important. Being enrolled in school suggests that he has alternative opportunities and responsibilities that might influence his decision to reoffend. This factor is neutral, neither increasing nor decreasing the risk significantly.\n\nEmployment history is a significant factor. The fact that he has held no jobs during the year indicates potential instability and possibly higher stress levels, which could correlate with increased criminal behavior. Given this, I would rate this as \"high.\"\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. This history of substance abuse is a strong indicator of higher risk for reoffending, so I would rate this as \"high.\"\n\nDepression history is also relevant. The fact that he has not felt depressed over the past month suggests relatively low mental health issues, which is positive. However, since depression can be a significant factor in criminal behavior, I would rate this as \"low.\"\n\nHis family background is complex and might influence his behavior. Growing up with both biological parents in a household of size 6 indicates a potentially stable upbringing, which could mitigate risk factors. This factor is neutral.\n\nFinally, his belief in God's role in personal matters is an interesting factor. It suggests that he may be more likely to follow moral guidelines due to religious beliefs, which could reduce the risk of reoffending. Given this, I would rate this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's consider all these factors together to make a prediction and assign a confidence level.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice and convicted once, indicating a significant history of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age and Gender\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with risk of reoffending based on age and gender alone.\"),\n    (\"Physical Attributes\", \"medium\", \"Height and weight do not suggest any particular risk factors related to violence or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone without a spouse, no direct correlation with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"neutral\", \"Enrolled in school, but alternative opportunities may influence decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year, indicating potential instability and higher stress levels.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"History of using drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, suggests higher risk for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Depression History\", \"low\", \"Not depressed over the past month, suggesting relatively low mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"neutral\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a household of size 6, potentially stable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has something to do with what happens personally, suggests potential adherence to moral guidelines.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
