    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the person's demographic and personal characteristics:\n\n- Age: 22 years old\n- Ethnicity/Color: Black\n- Arrests and convictions: 4 arrests, convicted\n- Physical attributes: Height (5'5\"), weight (221 lbs)\n- Marital status: Never married\n- Living situation: Currently living alone\n- Education level: No high school diploma or GED certificate\n- Employment: No jobs during the year\n- Substance use: Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana)\n- Mental health: Has not felt depressed over the past month\n- Family background: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 6, urban area\n- Spiritual beliefs: Believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally\n\nLet me think about each factor individually and then consider how they collectively influence the risk assessment.\n\n1. **Arrests and convictions**: The person has been arrested 4 times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past behavior and likelihood of future criminal activity.\n   - Weight: High\n\n2. **Substance use**: She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Substance abuse can be a risk factor for recidivism.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n3. **Living situation**: Currently living alone without any family support or support network. This could indicate isolation and lack of social support.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n4. **Education level**: No high school diploma or GED certificate, and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can be a risk factor for recidivism due to limited job opportunities.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n5. **Employment status**: No jobs during the year. Lack of employment history can also be a risk factor.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n6. **Family background**: Lived with her biological mother in a large household, urban area. This could indicate a lack of family support and potentially higher crime rates in urban areas.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n7. **Spiritual beliefs**: Believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This could be a mitigating factor but is difficult to quantify statistically.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n8. **Age and ethnicity/color**: Age 22, Black/Color. These factors can influence recidivism based on societal trends and biases.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n9. **Mental health**: Has not felt depressed over the past month. This is a positive factor indicating no current mental health issues.\n   - Weight: Low\n\nNow, let's consider how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n- Arrests and convictions (High)\n- Substance use (Medium)\n- Living situation (Low)\n- Education level (Medium)\n- Employment status (Low)\n- Family background (Medium)\n- Spiritual beliefs (Low)\n- Age and ethnicity/color (Low)\n- Mental health (Low)\n\nCombining these weights, the collective risk assessment suggests a medium to high likelihood of recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested 4 times and convicted, indicating a significant history of past criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which can be a risk factor for recidivism due to substance abuse patterns.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone without any family support or support network, indicating isolation and lack of social support.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate, and not enrolled in college, suggesting limited job opportunities and potential for low-skilled employment.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"low\", \"No jobs during the year, indicating a lack of recent work experience and potential unemployment history.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a large household (size 6) in an urban area, which may indicate higher crime rates or potential family support issues.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has something to do with what happens to her personally, which is difficult to quantify statistically and may be a mitigating factor but not directly related to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Age and ethnicity/color\", \"low\", \"22 years old, Black/Color, which are demographic factors that can influence recidivism but have low weight in the overall assessment.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating no current mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
