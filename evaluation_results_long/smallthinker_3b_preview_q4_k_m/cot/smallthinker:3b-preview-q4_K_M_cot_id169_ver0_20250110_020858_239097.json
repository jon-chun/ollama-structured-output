    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully think through the assignment of risk factors for a 21-year-old male White, who has been arrested three times, convicted, is 6 feet 0 inches tall, weighs 210 lbs, never married, lives alone, holds a high school diploma, has never been enrolled in college, held two jobs during the year, used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), and has not felt depressed over the past month. Additionally, he lived with both biological parents aged 4, in an urban area, and considers that God has something to do with his personal experiences.\n\nLet me break down each factor and assign a relative weight before using them collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests**: This is clearly indicative of criminal behavior. Given the person's history of three arrests and convictions, I would rate this as \"high\". The reasoning is straightforward: multiple arrests suggest a pattern of criminal activity.\n\n2. **Convictions**: Similar to arrests, convictions indicate past involvement in illegal activities. Given his two convictions, I would also assign \"high\" weight to this factor. Convictions are a strong indicator of potential future criminal behavior.\n\n3. **Age at First Arrest**: The age factor is less relevant here since the person has been arrested multiple times already. This factor gets a \"low\" rating because it doesn't significantly impact the prediction based on current data.\n\n4. **Education Level**: A high school diploma and lack of college enrollment might suggest limited life opportunities, but this is not strongly correlated with future criminal behavior. Therefore, I would assign a \"medium\" weight to this factor.\n\n5. **Employment History**: Holding two jobs during the year suggests some level of employability and stability. This factor also gets a \"medium\" rating because it doesn't directly correlate with future criminal activity.\n\n6. **Drug Use**: Using drugs in the past four years, but not feeling depressed over the past month, indicates no immediate risk of substance abuse-related problems that could lead to criminal behavior. Thus, I would rate this as \"low\".\n\n7. **Family Background**: Living with both biological parents aged 4 suggests a complex family environment, which might indicate some level of support or conflict. However, since we don't have specific information about the nature of this support or conflict, I would assign a \"medium\" weight to this factor.\n\n8. **Personal Beliefs**: Considering that God has something to do with personal experiences is a strong indicator of low risk for future criminal behavior. This factor gets an \"high\" rating because it suggests a strong moral compass and reduced likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\n9. **Current Living Situation**: Currently living alone, which might suggest more freedom but also potentially more vulnerability to peer pressure. However, since we don't have specific details about the environment, I would assign a \"medium\" weight to this factor.\n\n10. **Physical Appearance**: The person's physical appearance doesn't directly correlate with future criminal behavior. Therefore, I would rate this as \"low\".\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors in a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Two convictions suggest involvement in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"age_at_first_arrest\", \"low\", \"The age at first arrest does not significantly impact the prediction based on current data.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma and lack of college enrollment may indicate limited life opportunities, but this factor is not strongly correlated with future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs during the year suggests some level of employability and stability, but this does not directly correlate with future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Using drugs in the past four years may indicate substance abuse issues, but not feeling depressed over the past month suggests no immediate risk of substance-related problems that could lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents aged 4 may indicate a complex family environment, which might suggest some level of support or conflict.
