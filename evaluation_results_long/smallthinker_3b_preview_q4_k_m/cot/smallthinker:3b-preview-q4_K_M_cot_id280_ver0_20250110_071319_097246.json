    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested six times but has not been convicted. This is a significant point. Let me break it down - arrest history doesn't directly correlate to conviction, so I need to weigh the frequency and context of these arrests. Given that he hasn't been convicted, this factor seems moderate in its impact on risk.\n\nNext, his physical attributes: height and weight are straightforward. They don't suggest any particular risk beyond what is typical for his age and gender. So, I'll assign this a low risk weight.\n\nMarital status and living situation also seem to have little direct correlation with criminal behavior. Being unmarried and living alone doesn't indicate any specific risk factor related to crime. Therefore, I'll rate this as low.\n\nEducation level is another critical factor. He lacks a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests some educational limitations that could impact his future employment opportunities and potentially his path into criminal activity. So, I'll assign a medium risk weight to this factor.\n\nEmployment history: holding only one job during the year indicates limited work experience and possibly lower financial stability. However, it doesn't necessarily suggest any propensity towards crime. Therefore, I'll rate this as low.\n\nSubstance use is another important aspect - he hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These positive indicators for no substance abuse and mental health suggest a relatively stable lifestyle with fewer risk factors related to substance misuse or mental health issues. So, I'll assign this a low risk weight.\n\nLiving situation: being part of a household of size 4 with both biological parents at an urban area could potentially influence his environment but doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll rate this as low.\n\nFinally, his belief in God seems to indicate a strong sense of spirituality or faith. This factor is hard to quantify statistically and doesn't directly suggest any criminal propensity. So, I'll assign it a low risk weight.\n\nNow, let's summarize the weights for each factor:\n\n- Arrest history: moderate\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Marital status: low\n- Education level: medium\n- Employment history: low\n- Substance use: low\n- Living situation: low\n- Belief in God: low\n\nCombining these factors, the collective risk score is 4 out of 10. Given this moderate to high risk factor pool and the absence of other mitigating circumstances, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest recidivism within three years.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"moderate\", \"The person has been arrested six times but has not been convicted.
