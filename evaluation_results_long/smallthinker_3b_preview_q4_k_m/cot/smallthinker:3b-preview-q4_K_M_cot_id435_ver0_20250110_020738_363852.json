    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully assess each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. The person has been arrested nine times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of criminal behavior. Wait, let me break this down further - the fact that they've been arrested multiple times without any rehabilitation efforts suggests a pattern of antisocial behavior. This factor definitely warrants a high weight.\n\nNext, his current age of 19 and male identity are important contextual details. The legal system often treats young males differently due to societal norms and biases. However, these factors alone don't contribute much to the risk assessment beyond providing context.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes - height and weight. These characteristics don't directly influence criminal behavior but might be relevant in certain contexts. I'll assign a low weight to this factor since it doesn't significantly impact the prediction of recidivism.\n\nEducation level is another critical factor. The individual has no high school diploma or GED certificate, which indicates a lack of education and potential difficulties in finding employment. This suggests a higher risk of engaging in criminal activities due to economic pressures. Therefore, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nEmployment status is also important. The fact that he has not held any jobs during the year increases his vulnerability to financial instability and stress, which can lead to criminal behavior. This factor warrants a high weight as well.\n\nDrug use history shows that he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, indicating a clean record regarding substance abuse. This is a positive factor that should be given a low weight.\n\nMental health status indicates that he has not felt depressed over the past month, which is a good sign. However, the fact that he considers God to have something to do with his personal experiences might suggest an internalized moral framework. I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nLiving situation details provide insight into his social support network and living conditions. The fact that he lives with his biological mother in a household of size 14 indicates some level of familial support but also potential overcrowding issues. This factor should be given a low weight.\n\nFinally, the consideration of God's role in personal experiences might suggest an internalized moral framework that could influence behavior. I'll assign this as a medium weight.\n\nNow, let me aggregate these weights to form a prediction and confidence level. The high arrest history, lack of education, and employment issues are significant factors pointing towards a higher risk of recidivism. However, the clean drug use history and relatively stable living situation mitigate some risks. Therefore, I'll predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism with a medium-to-high likelihood.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of antisocial behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"These factors are contextual but do not significantly impact the prediction beyond providing age and gender context.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly influence criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED suggests a lack of education, potentially leading to unemployment and increased risk of crime.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs indicate vulnerability to financial instability and stress, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"low\", \"Clean drug use history reduces the likelihood of using drugs as an escape mechanism or for immediate gain.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed suggests a relatively stable mental state, but the consideration of God's role may indicate an internalized moral framework.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living with parents in a large household indicates familial support but also potential overcrowding issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

He has been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
