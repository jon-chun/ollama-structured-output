    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the situation step by step. I need to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor in risk assessment. Let me think about this carefully. Given the nature of these arrests and the fact that he hasn't been convicted yet, I would say the weight for this factor is high.\n\nNext, let's look at his physical characteristics. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 160 lbs. These factors don't directly impact recidivism in a statistically significant way, so I'll assign a low to medium weight to this factor. Let me check if there are any other relevant details here that might affect the weight assignment.\n\nNow, his marital status is currently living alone with no spouse or children. This suggests some level of independence and stability, which could be beneficial. However, since it's a relatively neutral point without strong implications for recidivism, I'll assign a low to medium weight.\n\nHis education level is high school diploma, not enrolled in college. This factor indicates potential limitations but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior at this stage. So, I'll also give this a low to medium weight.\n\nJob history: He has held 2 jobs during the year. This shows some level of employment stability and possibly skill development, which could be positive or negative depending on the context. Given that it's not excessively high or low, I'll assign a low to medium weight here as well.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests potential mental health issues or substance abuse problems, which are significant risk factors. So, I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nHis living situation growing up is also important. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. While it's not clear how this directly correlates to recidivism, the urban setting could indicate certain life circumstances that might be relevant. I'll assign a low to medium weight here.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is straightforward but doesn't significantly impact recidivism risk assessment. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction and confidence level. Based on the analysis above, it seems reasonable to predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism of \"YES\" with a moderate to high confidence level.\n\nHere is my refined answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested multiple times but not convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that may increase the likelihood of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low_to_medium\", \"Height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism risk in this case.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low_to_medium\", \"Currently living alone with no spouse or children does not strongly influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low_to_medium\", \"High school diploma, not enrolled in college, may indicate potential limitations but is not a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low_to_medium\", \"Two jobs during the year show some level of employment stability and skill development, which could be beneficial or detrimental depending on the context.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use (marijuana) and recent feelings of despair suggest potential mental health issues or substance abuse problems that may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low_to_medium\", \"Living with parents in an urban household at a young age does not directly correlate to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"The person's belief that God has nothing to do with their personal life is a neutral factor without significant impact on recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
