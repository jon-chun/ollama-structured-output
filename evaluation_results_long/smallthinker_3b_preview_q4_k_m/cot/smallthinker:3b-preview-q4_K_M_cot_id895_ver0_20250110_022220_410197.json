    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze each risk factor and assign a relative weight before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the arrest history:\n- The person has been arrested 4 times.\n- This is a significant number of arrests for an individual who has already had convictions.\n- Given this pattern, I would assign this factor as \"high\".\n\nNext, let me think about the conviction history:\n- The person has been convicted multiple times.\n- Convictions indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\n- This factor is also \"high\".\n\nNow, let's look at the physical attributes:\n- The person is 6 feet 6 inches tall.\n- While height can sometimes influence certain types of crimes, it does not directly correlate with recidivism.\n- I would assign this as \"low\".\n\nMoving on to personal life factors:\n- The person has never been married and lives alone.\n- This factor might suggest a lack of support system, which could be relevant in some contexts.\n- However, given the other factors, I would still rate it as \"medium\".\n\nLet me consider education and employment status:\n- The person does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and has held no jobs during the year.\n- This indicates significant educational and professional challenges.\n- Given these circumstances, this factor is also \"high\".\n\nNow, let's look at substance use:\n- The person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana).\n- Substance use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n- However, it's important to note that some of the time during the past month he felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up, which might indicate underlying mental health issues.\n- I would assign this as \"medium\".\n\nLet me think about living environment:\n- The person has lived in a household of size 7 at a young age.\n- Growing up in larger households can sometimes lead to social and behavioral challenges.\n- This factor is also \"medium\".\n\nFinally, let's consider the belief in God:\n- The person does not consider that God has anything to do with what happens to him personally.\n- This suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability, which could be relevant.\n- Given this, I would assign this as \"low\".\n\nNow, let's compile all these factors and make a prediction:\n- High arrest history\n- High conviction history\n- Low physical attributes\n- Medium personal life factors\n- High substance use\n- Medium living environment\n- Low belief in God\n\nGiven the collective analysis of these risk factors, I would predict a high likelihood of recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted multiple times, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions suggest a high risk of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height is not directly correlated with recidivism, so this factor carries low weight.\"),\n    (\"personal_life_factors\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate limited social support but also resilience in some cases.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate and no jobs during the year suggest significant educational and professional challenges.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially if accompanied by mental health issues, increases recidivism risk but is not the only factor here.\"),\n    (\"living_environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household may indicate social or behavioral challenges but does not directly correlate with recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
