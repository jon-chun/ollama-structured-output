    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old female who has been arrested three times, convicted, and lives with her biological mother in an urban area. Let me break down the factors one by one and assign a relative weight to each.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history and conviction record. The person has been arrested multiple times and has a conviction record. This suggests a pattern of behavior that could lead to further criminal activity. Wait, let me think... Given this history, I would rate this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNext, her age and gender are relevant but less impactful in the context of the specific risk factors provided. The person is 22 years old, which is not particularly young or old, and identifies as White. These characteristics do not significantly influence the likelihood of rearrest recidivism based on the given information. So, I would rate this factor as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's examine her physical appearance and living situation. The person is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. These details are not directly related to the risk of rearrest recidivism in this context. Therefore, I would rate this factor as \"low.\"\n\nHer education level is another factor. She has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests a lack of formal education and potential social isolation. However, the impact on rearrest recidivism seems moderate compared to other factors. So, I would rate this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nEmployment history shows that she has held two jobs during the year, which indicates some level of employability but also possibly limited job stability. This could be a relevant risk factor, so I would rate it as \"medium.\"\n\nSubstance use is a critical factor. The person has used drugs in the past four years and has felt down for an extended period in the past month. Substance abuse can significantly influence criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like employment instability. Therefore, I would rate this factor as \"high.\"\n\nLastly, her history of living with her biological mother and her belief in God are less directly relevant to the risk of rearrest recidivism based on the provided information. So, I would rate these factors as \"low.\"\n\nLet me summarize my findings:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history_and_conviction_record\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"The person's age is not particularly young or old, and her gender does not significantly influence the likelihood of rearrest recidivism based on the given information.\"),\n    (\"physical_appearance_and_living_situation\", \"low\", \"The person's physical appearance and living situation do not directly relate to the risk of rearrest recidivism in this context.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of formal education may influence social isolation, but its direct impact on rearrest recidivism seems moderate based on the provided information.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs during the year indicate some level of employability, but also possibly limited job stability, which could be a relevant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"The person's history of substance use and feelings of sadness suggest potential mental health issues that may impact her likelihood to engage in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_history_and_cultural_identity\", \"low\", \"The person's family history and cultural identity are less directly relevant to the risk of rearrest recidivism based on the provided information.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
