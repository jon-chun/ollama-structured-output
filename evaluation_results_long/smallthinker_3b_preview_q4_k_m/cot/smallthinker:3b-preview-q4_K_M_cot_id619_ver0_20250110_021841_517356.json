    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider each of the risk factors provided for the 18-year-old male identified as Hispanic. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors one by one:\n\n1. **Age**: The individual is 18 years old.\n   - Let me check the literature on youth recidivism rates. Studies show that younger individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates due to their inexperience and potential impulsivity. However, this factor might not be as critical compared to other aspects of the person's life.\n   \n2. **Convicted**: He has been convicted once.\n   - This is a significant factor. Convictions indicate past behavior that suggests a likelihood of reoffending. I need to consider how often convictions correlate with future criminal activity.\n   \n3. **Living Situation**: Currently living alone.\n   - Let me think about this. Living alone might suggest a lack of support network, which could increase the risk of getting involved in further criminal activities. However, it's not as directly correlated as other factors like employment or substance use.\n   \n4. **Education**: Enrolled in school at present.\n   - This is a strong positive indicator. Education can provide a sense of purpose and structure, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n   \n5. **Substance Use**: Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine).\n   - This is a critical factor. Substance use is strongly linked to increased risk of recidivism due to impaired judgment and potential involvement in drug-related crimes.\n   \n6. **Mental Health**: Has not felt depressed over the past month.\n   - Lack of depression might suggest that mental health issues are not currently contributing to criminal behavior, but it's important to consider other factors as well.\n   \n7. **Early Life**: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4, urban area at young age.\n   - This factor is complex. Living conditions and family dynamics can influence an individual's development and risk factors for crime. However, the specific details about this living situation are limited.\n   \n8. **Spiritual Belief**: Considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n   - This is a cultural and personal belief that might not directly correlate with recidivism rates. It could potentially influence behavior through moral guidance, but it's speculative.\n\nNow, let me assign the weights based on these considerations:\n\n- **Age**: Low (10%)\n  - Reasoning: While age can play a role, it's less significant compared to other factors like convictions and substance use.\n  \n- **Convicted**: High (40%)\n  - Reasoning: Convictions are a strong indicator of increased recidivism risk.\n  \n- **Living Situation**: Medium (20%)\n  - Reasoning: Living alone might suggest a lack of support network, but this is not as directly correlated as other factors.\n  \n- **Education**: High (30%)\n  - Reasoning: Being enrolled in school can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior due to structured education and potential future opportunities.\n\nNext, I'll consider how these factors collectively predict the risk:\n\n- The individual has a high conviction rate, which is a significant risk factor.\n- He has used drugs in the past four years, indicating substance use that could lead to impaired judgment and potentially reoffending.\n- His living situation and education status provide some mitigating factors.\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism of \"YES\" (80%).\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"While age can play a role, it's less significant compared to other factors like convictions and substance use.\"),\n    (\"Convicted\", \"high\", \"This is a strong indicator of increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone might suggest a lack of support network, but this is not as directly correlated as other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Being enrolled in school can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior due to structured education and potential future opportunities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
