    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the given information step by step. I need to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's break down the person's background:\n- Age: 19 years old\n- Race: Black\n- Arrest record: 1 time but not convicted\n- Physical attributes: Height and weight\n- Marital status: Never married\n- Living situation: Currently living alone\n- Education: GED certificate, not enrolled in college\n- Employment: Held 2 jobs during the year\n- Substance use: No drug use in the past four years\n- Mental health: Not felt depressed over the past month\n- Household size at a young age: Households of size 2\n- Belief: God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally\n\nLet me think about each factor one by one.\n\n1. **Age**: At 19, this person is still in their teenage years and may be more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior due to immaturity.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n2. **Race**: Being Black does not directly correlate with criminal behavior but can influence societal perceptions and biases.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n3. **Arrest record**: 1 arrest without conviction suggests some level of involvement with the law, which could indicate a higher risk.\n   - Weight: High\n\n4. **Height and weight**: Physical attributes do not significantly impact criminal behavior.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n5. **Marital status**: Never married can be a factor in personal stability but does not directly correlate with crime.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n6. **Living situation**: Currently living alone might suggest independence, which could influence risk-taking behaviors.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n7. **Education**: GED certificate and no college enrollment indicate some level of education but may also mean limited opportunities for personal growth.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n8. **Employment**: Holding 2 jobs during the year suggests financial stability and possibly a sense of responsibility, which could reduce risk-taking.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n9. **Substance use**: No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor indicating minimal substance-related risks.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n10. **Mental health**: Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health, reducing the likelihood of impulsive behavior.\n    - Weight: Low\n\n11. **Household size at a young age**: Households of size 2 might indicate a certain level of stability and possibly family support.\n    - Weight: Medium\n\n12. **Belief in God**: Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a low level of religiosity, which may not directly correlate with crime.\n    - Weight: Low\n\nNow, let's consider the collective risk factors:\n- High: Arrest record\n- Medium: Age, living situation, household size at young age\n- Low: Race, height and weight, marital status, education, employment, substance use, mental health, belief in God\n\nBased on this analysis, I can confidently say that the person is a high-risk individual for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, this person is still in their teenage years and may be more likely to engage in risk-taking behavior due to immaturity.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Being Black does not directly correlate with criminal behavior but can influence societal perceptions and biases.\"),\n    (\"arrest_record\", \"high\", \"1 arrest without conviction suggests some level of involvement with the law, which could indicate a higher risk.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not significantly impact criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married can be a factor in personal stability but does not directly correlate with crime.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone might suggest independence, which could influence risk-taking behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED certificate and no college enrollment indicate some level of education but may also mean limited opportunities for personal growth.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding 2 jobs during the year suggests financial stability and possibly a sense of responsibility, which could reduce risk-taking.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor indicating minimal substance-related risks.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health, reducing the likelihood of impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"household_size_at_young_age\", \"medium\", \"Households of size 2 might indicate a certain level of stability and possibly family support.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a low level of religiosity, which may not directly correlate with crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
