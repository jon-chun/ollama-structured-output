    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information about a 22-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors one by one:\n\n1. **Past Arrest**: The individual has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it suggests there might be underlying issues that led to his arrest. I'll consider this as medium weight because while he hasn't been convicted, the fact remains that he's had contact with law enforcement.\n\n2. **Age and Gender**: The person is 22 years old and male. These factors are often considered in risk assessments due to societal trends and biases. Given that there's no specific data indicating a higher risk for males at this age, I'll assign this as low weight.\n\n3. **Education Level**: He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. This indicates he has some education and is currently pursuing further learning. I'll consider this as medium weight because it suggests he might be more likely to change his behavior over time due to increased opportunities for growth.\n\n4. **Employment History**: The individual has held two jobs during the year. This shows a modicum of work ethic, but not extensive experience. I'll assign this as low weight because while having multiple jobs is positive, it doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk behaviors.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This is a significant factor because drug use can be indicative of potential criminal behavior or increased risk of recidivism. I'll consider this as high weight because it directly points to substance involvement, which can be a strong predictor of future illegal activities.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: The person has not felt depressed over the past month and considers God's influence in his life. This suggests he might have some form of support system or coping mechanisms in place. I'll assign this as low weight because mental health is generally considered a stable factor unless there are signs of worsening symptoms.\n\n7. **Family Background**: He lived with adults other than biological parents (foster or adoptive) in a household of size 3, in an urban area at a young age. This can be significant because living conditions and family dynamics often play a role in shaping behavior. I'll consider this as medium weight because it indicates potential influences that could shape his future actions.\n\n8. **Life Philosophy**: The individual considers God's influence in his life. This is more of an abstract factor, but it might suggest he values certain principles or has support networks. I'll assign this as low weight because it doesn't directly impact risk assessment unless there are specific beliefs linked to criminal behavior.\n\n9. **Urban Area Location**: He lives in an urban area. Urban areas can have different crime rates and social dynamics compared to rural areas, which might influence recidivism. I'll consider this as low weight because while urban living can present challenges, it doesn't necessarily mean higher risk behaviors are more likely.\n\n10. **Past Recidivism**: The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating a potential history of minor offenses. This is significant and will be considered as medium weight.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n- Medium (past arrest), Medium (age and gender), Medium (education level), Low (employment history), High (substance use), Low (mental health), Medium (family background), Low (life philosophy), Low (urban area location), Medium (past recidivism)\n\nGiven the combination of medium, high, and some low risk factors, I'll predict a 50% chance of rearrest. This is based on the idea that while he has some mitigating factors like education and employment, the substance use and past arrest are significant concerns.\n\nHere's my final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, which may indicate underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"Age and gender alone do not necessarily correlate with higher risk factors in this case.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests some education and potential for growth.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Two jobs during the year show a modicum of work ethic, but not extensive experience.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Using drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) may indicate higher risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests stable mental health.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with adults other than biological parents can influence behavior, but no specific indicators of higher risk here.\"),\n    (\"life_philoosophy\", \"low\", \"Considering God's influence does not directly impact recidivism prediction without specific beliefs linked to crime.\"),\n    (\"urban_area_location\", \"low\", \"Urban living may present challenges, but no direct correlation with higher risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"past_recidivism\", \"medium\", \"Past arrest and conviction concerns indicate potential for rearrest.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
