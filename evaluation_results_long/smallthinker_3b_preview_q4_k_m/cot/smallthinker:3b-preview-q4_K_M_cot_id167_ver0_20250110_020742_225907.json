    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully evaluate each risk factor for a 21-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. He is White, 6 feet 1 inch tall, weighs 155 lbs, lives alone, holds a GED certificate, and is enrolled in college. He has used drugs but not felt depressed recently, and had a family situation at age 8. Let me break this down step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the arrest and conviction. These are significant factors that indicate past criminal behavior. Given his single arrest and conviction, it suggests he might be at risk of reoffending within three years. So, I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nNext, age and gender. The individual is 21, which is relatively young, but there's no clear link between age and recidivism. However, the fact that he has been arrested once already might imply some level of risk. So, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nEducation and employment status are also important. He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in college, which suggests he is educated and possibly more likely to seek better opportunities. Being currently living alone indicates stability but doesn't directly relate to recidivism. So, I'll call this low weight.\n\nFamily background at age 8 shows that he had a larger household with three members. This could indicate some level of instability or lack of parental guidance. However, the impact on his behavior might be less clear. So, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use is another factor. He has used drugs in the past four years but not recently, which suggests that drug use may not currently pose a significant risk to reoffending within three years. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally might indicate resilience or lack of reliance on external factors for guidance. However, this doesn't directly correlate to recidivism. So, I'll call this medium.\n\nLet me summarize and finalize the analysis:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_and_conviction\", \"high\", \"A single arrest and conviction suggest a higher risk of reoffending within three years.\"),\n    (\"age_21\", \"medium\", \"While age is not directly linked to recidivism, his past behavior indicates a need for caution.\"),\n    (\"education_level_ged\", \"low\", \"Having a GED certificate suggests some level of education but does not necessarily correlate with reoffending risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"lives_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate stability but lacks direct correlation to recidivism factors.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_in_past_four_years\", \"low\", \"Recent drug use is a concern, but not feeling depressed for the past month suggests lower immediate risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family_background_living_with_three_members_at_age_8\", \"medium\", \"Family stability at age 8 may indicate some level of instability that could impact future behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
