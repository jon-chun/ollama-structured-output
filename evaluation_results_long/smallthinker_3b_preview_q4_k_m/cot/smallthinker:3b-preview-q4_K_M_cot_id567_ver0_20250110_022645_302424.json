    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided for the individual and assign a relative weight of low, medium, or high based on my expertise as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age. At 18 years old, he is in a critical period of development where many individuals are making significant life choices for the first time. This makes him more susceptible to peer influence and potential behavioral changes that could lead to criminal activities. So, I'll categorize this as high.\n\nNext, his arrest record. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. This is a relatively low risk factor because there's no conviction history, which suggests he might still be in the process of learning from his actions. So, I'll assign this as medium.\n\nHis physical attributes don't seem to directly influence criminal behavior, so I won't categorize them as high or medium. They are part of the contextual information but not a direct risk factor in terms of propensity for crime.\n\nHis marital status and living situation could be relevant. Being married and living with his spouse might indicate a stable environment that supports positive behaviors. However, it's important to consider other factors like education and employment history. So, I'll assign this as low.\n\nHis educational background is quite limited, which could be a significant risk factor for future criminal activities. Lack of formal education can limit job opportunities and potential financial stability, leading individuals into crime. So, I'll categorize this as high.\n\nEmployment history shows he has held two jobs in the past year. This suggests he has basic employment skills but might not have advanced career prospects. While it's positive, it doesn't directly impact future criminal behavior significantly. So, I'll assign this as medium.\n\nHis substance use and mental health status are also important. He hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed for a month. These factors indicate he is currently stable and unlikely to engage in criminal activities due to substance abuse or mental health issues. So, I'll categorize this as low.\n\nHis past living situation with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in a rural area could be relevant but lacks direct correlation to future criminal behavior. So, I'll assign this as medium.\n\nLastly, his belief in God and its influence on personal life might not directly impact criminal behavior unless it leads to a strong moral compass or a lack thereof. Given the information provided, I'll categorize this as low.\n\nNow, let's compile these thoughts into a JSON object format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"At 18 years old, he is in a critical period of development where many individuals are making significant life choices for the first time.
