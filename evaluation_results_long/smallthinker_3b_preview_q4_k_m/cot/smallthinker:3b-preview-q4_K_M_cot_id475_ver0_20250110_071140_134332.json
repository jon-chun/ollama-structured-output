    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully assess each risk factor for a 20-year-old female who has been arrested twice but not convicted. She is married, has held four jobs, used drugs in the past four years, and lives with her parents. Let me break down each factor step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider **arrest history**. The person has been arrested twice but not convicted. This indicates a pattern of potential criminal behavior. Given this context, I would assign this factor a **medium** weight because it suggests some level of criminal activity, but the lack of conviction may indicate mitigating factors or social support.\n\nNext, her **marital status** is important. Being married and living with her spouse might provide stability and support. However, this also means she has a family to consider, which could influence her behavior. I'll assign this factor a **low** weight because the marital status itself does not strongly indicate risk beyond what's already considered in other factors.\n\nHer **education level** is high school diploma, not enrolled in college. This suggests limited formal education and possibly fewer opportunities for advancement. However, it also means she has some practical experience and may be resourceful. I'll assign this factor a **low** weight because while it indicates potential challenges, it does not strongly predict higher-risk behavior.\n\nHer **employment history** shows four jobs in one year. This suggests adaptability and possibly a strong work ethic. However, the number of jobs might also indicate job-hopping or difficulties in retaining employment. I'll assign this factor a **low** weight because while multiple jobs can be seen as positive resilience, it does not strongly predict higher-risk behavior.\n\nHer **drug use** is marijuana in the past four years. This indicates some substance abuse but not frequent or severe use. I'll assign this factor a **medium** weight because drug use can be a risk factor, but the frequency and severity are moderate.\n\nHer **mental health** status shows no depression over the past month. This suggests she is currently coping well with mental health issues, which is positive. I'll assign this factor a **low** weight because current mental health status does not strongly predict higher-risk behavior.\n\nHer **family background** includes living with both biological parents in an urban household of size 3. This indicates some family support and possibly influences her behavior through socialization and cultural context. I'll assign this factor a **medium** weight because it suggests a supportive environment but also potential influence from familial factors.\n\nLastly, her belief that \"God has something to do with what happens to me personally\" might indicate a strong sense of spirituality or moral compass. This could influence her behavior positively. However, the direct impact on risk assessment is moderate. I'll assign this factor a **medium** weight because it suggests some level of moral guidance but does not strongly predict higher-risk behavior.\n\nLet's summarize these factors in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"A pattern of potential criminal behavior, though not convicted\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Marriage may provide stability and support\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Limited formal education, but possibly resourceful\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Multiple jobs indicate adaptability and resilience\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Moderate substance abuse with no severe issues\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month, positive outlook\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Supportive environment, but influences from family exist\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nThis assessment reflects a careful consideration of each factor and its potential impact on the person's risk of rearrest.",
