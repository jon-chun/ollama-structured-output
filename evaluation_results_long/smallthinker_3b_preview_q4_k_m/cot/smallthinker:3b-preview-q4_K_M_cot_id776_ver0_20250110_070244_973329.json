    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest and conviction history. The fact that he has already been convicted once is significant. This suggests a pattern of aggressive behavior or lack of respect for the law. Therefore, I would assign this factor a high weight. \"Let me think... Conviction history is a strong indicator of future criminal activity.\"\n\nNext, I'll consider his age and gender. Being 19 years old puts him in a period of high risk for crime, given that many young adults are still developing their life skills and may be more prone to impulsive decisions. Additionally, males have historically higher rates of incarceration than females. \"Wait a minute... Age and gender both point towards increased risk.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his substance use history. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While this is not as severe as other factors, it still indicates potential instability or rebellious behavior. Therefore, I'll rate this as medium. \"Let me check... Substance use can be a warning sign but may not always lead to criminal activity.\"\n\nRegarding his marital status and living situation, he is currently living alone without a spouse. This suggests independence and potentially a lack of social support network, which could influence his decision-making. However, the impact is less severe compared to other factors. \"Let me think... Living alone can be a sign of independence but also a potential vulnerability.\"\n\nHis educational background and employment history are positive. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, as well as having held multiple jobs. This indicates stability and a commitment to education and work. \"Wait, this is important... His stable lifestyle suggests he values responsibility and hard work.\"\n\nConsidering his past living situation, he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in a rural area. This background might have influenced his socialization and could be seen as less risky compared to other factors. \"Let me check... A stable upbringing can provide a foundation for responsible behavior.\"\n\nLastly, his belief in God has personal significance but does not directly influence his crime risk. This factor is more about his psychological makeup than his criminal activity. \"Wait a minute... Belief in God may offer support but it doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior.\"\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each factor, I'll assign the following weights:\n\n- Arrest and conviction history: high\n- Age and gender: medium (due to historical crime rates)\n- Substance use: medium\n- Marital status and living situation: low (as he is stable and independent)\n- Educational background and employment: medium (positive factors that may reduce risk)\n- Past living situation: low (no significant impact on crime risk)\n- Belief in God: low (neutral factor)\n\nBased on this analysis, the collective prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_and_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Already convicted once suggests a pattern of aggressive behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"Young age and male gender increase risk due to historical crime rates.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use indicates potential instability or rebellious behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone, stable lifestyle with no significant impact on crime risk.\"),\n    (\"educational_background_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment indicate stability and commitment to education and work.\"),\n    (\"past_living_situation\", \"low\", \"Lived in a rural household with parents, background may influence socialization but not directly related to crime risk.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God has personal significance but does not directly influence crime risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
