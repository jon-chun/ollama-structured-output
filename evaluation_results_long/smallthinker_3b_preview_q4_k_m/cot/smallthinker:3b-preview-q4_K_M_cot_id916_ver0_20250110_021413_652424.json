    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the given individual and assign a relative weight to it. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors that might influence the 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction:\n\n1. Age (21 years old)\n2. Race (White identification)\n3. Arrested but not convicted\n4. Height and Weight (5'9\" and 160 lbs)\n5. Marital Status (never married, currently not living alone)\n6. Education level (associate/junior college graduate, not enrolled in college)\n7. Employment history (held 2 jobs during the year)\n8. Substance use (used drugs in the past four years - marijuana and cocaine)\n9. Mental health (not felt depressed over the past month)\n10. Family background (lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4)\n11. Personal beliefs (God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally)\n\nLet me check each factor one by one.\n\n**Factor 1: Age**\n- The individual is 21 years old, which is still young and may not have accumulated much life experience or matured fully.\n- Let me think... this factor seems moderate in its impact on recidivism risk.\n- Assigning a weight of \"medium\".\n\n**Factor 2: Race (White identification)**\n- This factor does not provide any information about the individual's behavior, motivations, or tendencies towards crime.\n- It is neutral and does not influence the prediction significantly.\n- Assigning a weight of \"low\".\n\n**Factor 3: Arrested but not convicted**\n- While arrested, this individual has not been convicted. This suggests that they may be more likely to return to the same behavior in the future.\n- Let me think... this factor seems high in its impact on recidivism risk.\n- Assigning a weight of \"high\".\n\n**Factor 4: Height and Weight**\n- These physical attributes do not provide any information about the individual's behavior or tendencies towards crime.\n- They are neutral and do not influence the prediction significantly.\n- Assigning a weight of \"low\".\n\n**Factor 5: Marital Status (never married, currently not living alone)**\n- This factor does not provide any information about the individual's behavior or motivations.\n- It is neutral and does not influence the prediction significantly.\n- Assigning a weight of \"low\".\n\n**Factor 6: Education level (associate/junior college graduate, not enrolled in college)**\n- The individual has completed an associate/junior college education but is not currently enrolled. This suggests some level of educational attainment and possibly a foundation for future learning or career development.\n- Let me think... this factor seems low in its impact on recidivism risk.\n- Assigning a weight of \"low\".\n\n**Factor 7: Employment history (held 2 jobs during the year)**\n- Holding two jobs suggests some level of employment stability and possibly financial responsibility.\n- Let me think... this factor seems low in its impact on recidivism risk.\n- Assigning a weight of \"low\".\n\n**Factor 8: Substance use (used drugs in the past four years - marijuana and cocaine)**\n- Past substance use can be indicative of potential behavioral issues or tendencies towards criminal activity, especially if the use is frequent.\n- Let me think... this factor seems high in its impact on recidivism risk.\n- Assigning a weight of \"high\".\n\n**Factor 9: Mental health (not felt depressed over the past month)**\n- The individual has not felt depressed recently, which may suggest some level of mental well-being and stability.\n- Let me think... this factor seems low in its impact on recidivism risk.\n- Assigning a weight of \"low\".\n\n**Factor 10: Family background (lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4)**\n- Growing up in a larger family environment may provide some social support and structure, potentially influencing behavior.\n- Let me think... this factor seems low in its impact on recidivism risk.\n- Assigning a weight of \"low\".\n\n**Factor 11: Personal beliefs (God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally)**\n- This statement does not provide any information about the individual's behavior or motivations, and it is neutral regarding recidivism risk.\n- Assigning a weight of \"low\".\n\nNow that I have assigned weights to each factor, let me think about how they collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. The factors with high weights are arrested but not convicted (high), substance use (high), and personal beliefs (low). The other factors do not significantly influence the prediction.\n\nLet me check my overall confidence in this prediction. Given the combination of a young age, arrested status, and past substance use, I feel moderate to high confidence that there is a risk of recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21 years old)\", \"medium\", \"The individual's youth may indicate some level of immaturity or lack of life experience, which could influence their behavior in the future.\"),\n    (\"Race (White identification)\", \"low\", \"This factor does not provide any information about the individual's behavior or motivations, making it neutral and having little impact on the prediction.\"),\n    (\"Arrested but not convicted\", \"high\", \"A past arrest without conviction may indicate a higher risk of recidivism, as it suggests that the individual has demonstrated some level of criminal tendencies in the past.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"These physical attributes do not provide any information about the individual's behavior or motivations, making them neutral and having little impact on the prediction.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (never married, currently not living alone)\", \"low\", \"This factor does not provide any information about the individual's behavior or motivations, making it neutral and having little impact on the prediction.\"),\n    (\"Education level (associate/junior college graduate, not enrolled in college)\", \"low\", \"The individual has completed an associate/junior college education but is not currently enrolled.
