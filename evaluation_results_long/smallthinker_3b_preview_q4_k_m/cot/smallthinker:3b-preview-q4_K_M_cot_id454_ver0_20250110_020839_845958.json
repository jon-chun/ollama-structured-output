    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully assess the given information about a 22-year-old White female with several risk factors. Let me break down each factor and think through it step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested twice and convicted. This is quite significant. Arrests are indicators of criminal behavior, and convictions suggest a pattern of law-breaking. Given this context, I would assign a high weight to her arrest history. \n\nNext, her age. At 22 years old, she is relatively young. Youth can be seen as a risk factor in terms of potential recidivism due to the stage of life being influenced by developmental factors and societal pressures. However, her maturity might also play a role in mitigating this. I would assign a medium weight to her age.\n\nNow, let's look at her criminal history. She has been arrested twice, which is a clear indicator of a history of law-breaking. This factor deserves a high weight as well.\n\nEducation level. She has a high school diploma and is currently enrolled in a 4-year college. This suggests that she has some form of educational attainment and is pursuing higher education. While this might not directly correlate with recidivism, it does indicate a commitment to personal development. I would assign a low weight to her education level.\n\nEmployment history. She has held only one job during the year, which indicates a limited work history. This could be seen as a risk factor for future employment stability and financial security, but it's not directly correlated with recidivism. Therefore, I would also assign a low weight to her employment history.\n\nDrug use is another factor. She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can influence criminal behavior and might be linked to substance abuse disorders or other related issues. However, given that she does not feel depressed and has no recent symptoms of mental health issues, I would assign a low weight to her drug use.\n\nLiving situation is also important. She currently lives alone but has lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 5 when she was younger. This could indicate instability or potential influences from the environment. However, given that she has been living alone for some time now and does not report any significant issues, I would assign a low weight to her living situation.\n\nPersonal beliefs are another aspect. She considers God's role in what happens to her personally. This suggests a strong sense of spirituality and potentially a lower likelihood of criminal behavior driven by personal beliefs or values. Therefore, I would assign a low weight to her personal beliefs.\n\nFinally, depression is not reported recently. This absence of depressive symptoms might suggest that she has access to resources or support systems that help manage mental health issues. Given this context, I would assign a low weight to the lack of depression.\n\nNow, let's summarize these factors and make a prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of law-breaking, indicating a high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may indicate potential for recidivism due to developmental influences, but also suggests maturity that might mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests and convictions are clear indicators of a history of law-breaking, warranting a high weight in the prediction.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest some educational attainment, which might not directly correlate with recidivism but indicates personal development.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Limited work history might indicate instability, but does not directly relate to recidivism given her current living situation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Past use of marijuana is noted, but no recent depression or mental health issues suggest a low weight for this factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Lives alone now, with prior living with adults other than biological parents.
