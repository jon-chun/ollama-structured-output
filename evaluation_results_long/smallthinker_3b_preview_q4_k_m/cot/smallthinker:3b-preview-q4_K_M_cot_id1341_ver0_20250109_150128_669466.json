    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign risk weights to each factor before using them collectively to predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the person's age and gender. At 21 years old, she is in her early twenties, which means she has had enough time to potentially have multiple run-ins with the law without much intervention or rehabilitation. This suggests a medium risk weight for age.\n\nNext, let's look at the number of arrests and convictions. The person has been arrested 5 times and convicted. This indicates a high level of criminal activity, suggesting a high risk weight for arrests and convictions.\n\nThe person's physical attributes are listed, but these do not directly affect her likelihood of reoffending. Therefore, I will assign a low risk weight to height and weight.\n\nMarital status is also important. She is married and currently living alone, which might indicate some stability in her life, suggesting a low risk weight for marital status.\n\nEducation level is another factor. She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. This indicates she may have limited education or vocational training, which could be a medium risk weight for education.\n\nEmployment history shows that she has held 2 jobs during the year. While this might suggest some stability and adaptability, it also could indicate a lack of long-term employment, which might be considered a low risk weight for employment.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. The person has not used any drugs in the past four years, suggesting a medium risk weight for substance use.\n\nDepression history indicates that she has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests a low risk weight for depression.\n\nLiving situation in her early life was with her biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. This might indicate some influence from her environment, but it is also possible to have overcome this, so I will assign a medium risk weight for living situation.\n\nLastly, the person's belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally could be seen as a low risk weight for religious involvement.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors:\n\n- Age: Medium\n- Arrests and convictions: High\n- Height and weight: Low\n- Marital status: Low\n- Education: Medium\n- Employment: Low\n- Substance use: Medium\n- Depression: Low\n- Living situation: Medium\n- Religious involvement: Low\n\nCombining these, the overall risk is high due to significant criminal history.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Early twenties with potential for multiple run-ins with law\"),\n    (\"arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"5 arrests and convictions indicating potential for repeat offenses\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes not directly related to reoffending\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Married and currently living alone suggesting some stability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but no college enrollment possibly indicating limited education or vocational training\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"2 jobs in the year suggesting some employment history but potentially lacking long-term employment\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"No substance use in the past four years but may not indicate a complete absence of drug involvement\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Hasn't felt depressed in the past month possibly indicating resilience\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban household potentially influencing environment and behavior\"),\n    (\"religious_involvement\", \"low\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with personal life suggesting low risk of being influenced by religious beliefs\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
