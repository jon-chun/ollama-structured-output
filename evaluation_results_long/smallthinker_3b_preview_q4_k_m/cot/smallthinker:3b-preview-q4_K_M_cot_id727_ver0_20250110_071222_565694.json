    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors provided:\n\n- Arrested (1 time)\n- No conviction\n- Age: 19 years old\n- Height: 5 ft 7 inches\n- Weight: 185 lbs\n- Never married\n- Living alone\n- No high school diploma or GED certificate\n- Not enrolled in college\n- Used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years\n- Has not felt depressed over the past month\n- Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5, urban area\n- Believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally\n\nLet me break this down one by one.\n\n1. **Arrested (1 time)**: This is a significant factor. Being arrested once can be indicative of some level of risk. However, since it's not a conviction and there's no further information about the circumstances, I'll rate this as \"medium\" because arrests are concerning but not necessarily definitive indicators of future criminal behavior.\n\n2. **No conviction**: This mitigates the impact of being arrested. Since there's no conviction, this factor is less severe. Therefore, I'll rate it as \"low\".\n\n3. **Age (19 years old)**: The age factor here is neutral. Being 19 years old doesn't necessarily indicate higher or lower risk unless combined with other factors. So, I'll rate this as \"medium\" because while the age itself isn't particularly high-risk, being a young adult can sometimes mean more impulsivity.\n\n4. **Height and weight**: These physical characteristics are not relevant to risk assessment in criminal behavior. They don't influence how likely someone is to commit a crime. So, I'll rate this as \"low\".\n\n5. **Never married**, **Living alone**: Being single or living alone doesn't directly relate to criminal risk. These factors can be part of a broader picture but aren't significant enough on their own to warrant a high or medium risk assessment. Therefore, I'll rate them both as \"medium\" because they suggest some level of independence that might not inherently correlate with higher risk.\n\n6. **No high school diploma/GED**, **Not enrolled in college**: These factors can be indicative of lower educational attainment and potentially lower socioeconomic status. Lower education levels have been linked to higher crime rates, so this factor is significant. I'll rate it as \"high\" because it suggests a need for vocational training or further education, which might help mitigate future criminal behavior.\n\n7. **Used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years**: Using marijuana can be a risk factor for substance abuse and potentially higher crime rates. However, since it's only marijuana and not a regular use pattern is mentioned, I'll rate this as \"medium\" because it's a concerning behavior but not as severe as other factors.\n\n8. **Has not felt depressed over the past month**: This suggests relatively good mental health, which is positive. It's unlikely to directly influence criminal risk unless there are underlying issues that aren't evident here. Therefore, I'll rate this as \"low\".\n\n9. **Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5, urban area**: Living in an urban household might indicate different social dynamics and potential exposure to crime. However, the specific family circumstances aren't directly linked to future criminal behavior. So, I'll rate this as \"medium\" because while it's not necessarily high-risk, it suggests some level of vulnerability.\n\n10. **Believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally**: This is a personal belief and doesn't directly influence risk assessment in terms of criminal behavior. It might indicate higher resilience or different life values but isn't relevant to predicting future crime. Therefore, I'll rate this as \"low\".\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a collective prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nGiven the analysis above, here is my JSON response:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested (1 time)\", \"medium\", \"Being arrested once can be concerning but mitigated by no conviction.\"),\n    (\"No conviction\", \"low\", \"A lack of conviction suggests a lower likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age (19 years old)\", \"medium\", \"While age is not high-risk, it's important to consider the young adult phase which may involve more impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not relevant to risk assessment in this context.\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"medium\", \"Singles and single individuals can be part of a broader picture but aren't typically high-risk on their own.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Independence doesn't directly correlate with higher crime risk unless combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma/GED\", \"high\", \"Lower education levels have been linked to higher crime rates, suggesting potential need for training or education.\"),\n    (\"Not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Not being in college can be part of a broader picture but isn't typically high-risk on its own unless combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"Used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years\", \"medium\", \"Drug use is concerning but not as severe as some other factors when only marijuana is used and no regular use pattern is evident.\"),\n    (\"Has not felt depressed over the past month\", \"low\", \"Good mental health is generally a positive indicator for lower risk of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5, urban area\", \"medium\", \"While potentially vulnerable to crime due to living conditions, this isn't typically high-risk unless combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"Believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally\", \"low\", \"Personal beliefs are not directly relevant to predicting future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
