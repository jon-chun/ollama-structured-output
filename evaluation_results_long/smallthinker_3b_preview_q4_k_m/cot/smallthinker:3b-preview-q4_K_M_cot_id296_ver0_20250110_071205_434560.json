    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor that points towards a higher risk of recidivism. Let me think about this... Given the frequency and nature of these incidents, I would classify this as high-risk. It suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is still relatively young, which means there's potential for growth and change over time. However, his male gender does not inherently suggest higher recidivism risk. Wait, let me check... No, I'll keep this as low-risk.\n\nNow, his physical attributes. He is tall and of a certain weight range, but these factors do not directly correlate with recidivism risk. So, I'll classify this as low-risk.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone without a spouse or dependents. This suggests independence, which could be protective against high-risk behavior. Therefore, I'll rate this as low-risk.\n\nEducation and employment history: He has no diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college. Additionally, he has held only two jobs during the year. These factors indicate limited education and a lack of stable employment, both of which are associated with higher recidivism risk. Let me think... Yes, this should be high-risk.\n\nSubstance use: He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), and some times in the past month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests a history of drug use and current emotional distress, both of which are linked to higher recidivism risk. So, I'll classify this as high-risk.\n\nPrevious living environment: He lived with his biological dad in a household of size 3, in an urban area. This information might be relevant but does not directly correlate with recidivism risk. Therefore, I'll keep this at low-risk.\n\nBelief in God's role: His belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is more of a personal statement and does not directly impact recidivism risk. So, I'll rate this as low-risk.\n\nNow, let me compile all these factors into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrested\", \"high\", \"Previous arrests and convictions indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age alone does not predict high recidivism risk, especially for an individual in their early twenties.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Gender is not a significant predictor of recidivism risk without additional context or behavior.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone does not suggest higher recidivism risk, as it indicates independence.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and unemployment suggest limited education and potential for higher-risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"History of drug use and current emotional distress (feeling down without cheerfulness) indicate a higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"previous_living_environment\", \"low\", \"Previous living environment in an urban household does not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role is more of a personal statement and does not predict recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis JSON object encapsulates the detailed analysis and reasoning behind each risk factor, leading to a final prediction and confidence level.",
