    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information about a 19-year-old male who has been arrested multiple times, has a history of drug use, and other factors. Let me break down each risk factor step-by-step to assign a relative weight before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. The person has been arrested three times and convicted, which indicates a high level of involvement with the criminal justice system. This is certainly a significant factor that could lead to future criminal behavior. Let me think... Given this history, I would rate this as \"high.\"\n\nNext, drug use. The individual has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, and some times felt down so much that nothing could cheer him up. Drug use is a well-known risk factor for recidivism. This suggests a high level of substance abuse, which I would also rate as \"high.\"\n\nNow, let's consider his employment history. He has held seven jobs during the year, which indicates frequent job-hopping and a lack of long-term commitment to any particular employer or industry. This could suggest instability in life and work, potentially leading to further criminal activities. I'll rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nEducation level is another factor. The person has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. While education can be a protective factor against crime, the lack of higher education might indicate limited future prospects and a greater likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. I would rate this as \"low.\"\n\nLiving situation is also important. He currently lives alone after being raised in a household with five people. This change in living situation might cause stress or feelings of isolation, potentially leading to criminal activities. I'll rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nReligion plays a role here too. The individual considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a low level of religiosity and possibly a lack of moral guidance or personal values. I would rate this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's consider his physical characteristics and behavioral patterns. He is 6 feet 0 inches tall and weighs 180 lbs, which doesn't seem particularly relevant to risk assessment in this context. I'll rate this as \"low.\"\n\nFinally, his family background. He lived with both biological parents in a household of size five when he was young. This suggests some level of family support but also possibly a history of dysfunctional relationships or high levels of stress. I would rate this as \"medium.\"\n\nLet me summarize these factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: High\n- Drug use: High\n- Employment stability: Medium\n- Education level: Low\n- Living situation: Medium\n- Religion: Low\n- Physical characteristics: Low\n- Family background: Medium\n\nNow, let's collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the high arrest history and drug use, along with medium employment and living situation factors, I would predict a \"YES\" for recidivism.\n\nFor confidence, given the strong indicators of past criminal behavior and substance abuse, I'll rate this at 80%.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a high level of involvement with the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"History of drug use in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, suggests a high risk of substance abuse and potential for further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Seven jobs during the year indicate frequent job-hopping and lack of long-term commitment to any particular employer or industry.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma with no higher education indicates limited future prospects and possibly a greater likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to lack of skills and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone after being raised in a household with five people may cause stress or feelings of isolation, potentially leading to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a low level of religiosity and possibly a lack of moral guidance or personal values.\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not particularly relevant to risk assessment in this context.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both biological parents in a household of size five when young, suggesting some level of family support but also possibly a history of dysfunctional relationships or high levels of stress.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
