    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down each factor step by step and think about its impact on their likelihood of being rearrested within three years.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. The person has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates potential involvement with law enforcement or legal issues. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the risk might be lower compared to someone who has had convictions. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, his gender and race are important. Being male and Black can influence various factors related to criminal behavior and recidivism. These factors should be considered in context with other characteristics. Wait a minute... let me check if there's any significant research that suggests these factors alone can predict recidivism rates without considering other aspects.\n\nNow, his physical attributes are straightforward. Being 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighing 170 lbs is typical and doesn't seem to directly impact criminal behavior in this context. So, I'll classify this as low risk.\n\nEducation level is another factor. He has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests a lower educational attainment, which could be correlated with higher recidivism rates due to limited job opportunities and social support. Let me think about how to weight this...\n\nEmployment status is also crucial. The person has held no jobs during the year. Lack of employment can be linked to increased criminal activity as a means of survival or financial gain. This factor should be weighted high.\n\nDrugs used in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and feelings of depression are significant. Substance abuse and mental health issues can both contribute to risky behavior and recidivism. I'll classify these as medium risk factors because they suggest potential instability but aren't directly indicative of criminal intent.\n\nLiving conditions with his biological mother in a large household is another factor. Living in close proximity to family members might influence their decisions, especially if there are substance abuse or mental health issues within the family unit. This should be weighted low to medium due to the limited direct impact on individual criminal behavior.\n\nLastly, his belief in God and how it relates to personal experiences could indicate a sense of responsibility or lack thereof. This is more about psychological factors that might influence decision-making but isn't directly predictive of recidivism. So, I'll classify this as low risk.\n\nNow, let's aggregate these factors into a risk assessment:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested twice, indicating potential involvement with law enforcement or legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Male and Black\", \"low\", \"While being male and Black may influence various factors related to criminal behavior and recidivism, this factor alone is not indicative of increased risk without considering other characteristics.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"The individual's physical attributes are typical and do not directly impact his likelihood of being rearrested within three years.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED certificate suggests limited education and potential social support, which may be correlated with higher recidivism rates due to limited job opportunities and social support networks.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"The individual has held no jobs during the year, indicating a lack of stable employment and potentially increased criminal activity as a means of survival or financial gain.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, which may indicate substance abuse issues that could contribute to risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"Depression Feelings\", \"medium\", \"The individual reports feeling down during most of the past month, which may be indicative of underlying mental health issues that could impact decision-making and risk-taking.\"),\n    (\"Living Conditions\", \"low\", \"The individual's living situation is not directly linked to increased recidivism rates without considering other factors such as family dynamics or social support networks.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"While the individual's belief in God may influence his sense of responsibility and morality, this factor alone is unlikely to significantly impact his likelihood of being rearrested within three years.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 62\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
