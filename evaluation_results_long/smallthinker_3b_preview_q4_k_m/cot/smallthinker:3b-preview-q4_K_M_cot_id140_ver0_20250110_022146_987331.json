    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information about a 22-year-old male White person who has been arrested six times and convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider his arrest and conviction history. With six arrests and convictions, it's clear that he has a significant criminal record. This suggests a high risk of recidivism. So, let's start with that.\n\nNext, I'll look at his substance use. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has felt down in the dumps for some time during the past month. These factors indicate potential mental health issues or substance abuse problems, which could be contributing to his criminal behavior. This also suggests a high risk.\n\nNow, let's consider his educational background. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates limited education and possible lack of skills, which might limit his opportunities for employment and future prospects. I'll rate this as medium-risk.\n\nLiving conditions are another factor. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 when he was young. While this information could provide insight into his family dynamics and environment during formative years, it's difficult to quantify its impact on recidivism directly. So, let's assign this as low-risk.\n\nHis employment history is also noteworthy. He has held only two jobs during the year, which suggests limited job experience and potential difficulty in securing stable employment. This indicates a medium-risk factor.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally could be seen as a personal coping mechanism or worldview that might influence his behavior. However, it's difficult to quantify its direct impact on recidivism risk. So, I'll assign this as low-risk.\n\nLet me check my analysis again and see if there are any other factors I might have missed. After careful consideration, here is the JSON object with the assigned risk factors:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested and convicted\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a high likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of drug use and feelings of despair suggest potential substance abuse or mental health issues, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Limited education\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma/GED certificate and not enrolled in college indicate limited educational attainment, which may limit future employment opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living conditions\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5 when young; difficult to quantify impact on recidivism directly.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Only two jobs during the year indicate limited job experience and potential difficulty in securing stable employment, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's influence\", \"low\", \"Belief that God has something to do with personal experiences may be a coping mechanism or worldview; difficult to quantify direct impact on recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
