    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old male, White, who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me break down each factor step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has a single arrest with conviction. This is a clear indication of recent criminal behavior, which could increase recidivism risk. However, it's important to note that this factor alone doesn't tell the whole story about future behavior. So, I'll assign a weight of \"medium\" here.\n\nNext, his age and gender are relatively stable factors. At 22 years old, he is still in a formative stage of life, which could influence his decisions. However, as an adult male, he has more responsibility and potential for growth. Given this mix, I'll also assign a \"medium\" weight to this factor.\n\nPhysical characteristics such as height and weight are generally not significant risk factors in criminal behavior. So, I'll assign them both a \"low\" weight.\n\nMarital status is another factor. Currently, he is single and not living alone, which might indicate more freedom and potentially higher risk of substance use or other risky behaviors. But given the lack of concrete evidence of such activities, I'll still assign it a \"medium\" weight.\n\nEducation level is important. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, showing an interest in further education. This suggests he might be more cautious due to his educational aspirations. So, I'll assign this a \"low\" weight as well.\n\nEmployment history shows that he holds only one job during the past year. While having no jobs can indicate potential instability, it's not directly correlated with future criminal behavior without other factors. Thus, I'll also assign it a \"medium\" weight.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is positive. However, his history of arrest and conviction suggests he might be at higher risk for substance abuse. Given this, I'll still assign it a \"medium\" weight.\n\nMental health status is important too. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. But given his arrest history, there could be underlying issues. So, I'll also assign this a \"medium\" weight.\n\nHis living situation is another factor. Growing up in a household of size 5 with parents might influence his behavior, but as an adult, he has more autonomy. So, I'll assign it a \"medium\" weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with personal events suggests he is independent and possibly less religiously influenced. This factor doesn't directly correlate to criminal risk, so I'll assign it a \"low\" weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given all these factors, it seems there are more indications of potential future crime than no indication. Therefore, I'll predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism as \"YES\".\n\nLet me summarize this in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest with conviction may indicate recent criminal behavior, but its significance depends on other factors.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"As an adult male, he has more responsibility and potential for growth.
