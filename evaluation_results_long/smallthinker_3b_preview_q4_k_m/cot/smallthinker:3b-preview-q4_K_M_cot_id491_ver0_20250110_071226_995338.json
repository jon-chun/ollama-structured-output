    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the provided information about a 20-year-old male named John who has been arrested once but not convicted. He is of White ethnicity, standing at 5 feet 9 inches and weighing 145 lbs. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is currently not living alone. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 20 years old, the risk of recidivism might seem higher compared to older individuals, but it's important to note that younger adults are often more impulsive and may face unique challenges due to their youth and potential developmental issues. However, given that he has not been convicted yet, this factor is somewhat mitigated.\n\nNext, his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests a low risk of recidivism. The lack of conviction indicates that there might be extenuating circumstances or legal interventions in place, reducing the likelihood of future offenses.\n\nHis physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014are relatively average for someone of his age and ethnicity. These factors do not significantly impact his risk profile on their own.\n\nEducation is another crucial factor. John does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, which could suggest limited educational attainment and potentially lower employability. However, he has held only one job during the year, which might indicate employment difficulties rather than an inability to secure work.\n\nSubstance use history shows that John has not used drugs in the past four years, indicating a stable period without substance abuse. This is a positive factor reducing his risk profile.\n\nMental health status indicates that he has not felt depressed over the past month, suggesting good mental health and stability. This further supports a low-risk assessment.\n\nHis living situation\u2014currently not living alone and never married\u2014suggests a certain level of independence and possibly reduced social support networks, which could influence his behavior. However, given that he is currently stable and not facing immediate pressures, this factor is somewhat neutralized.\n\nHis family background indicates living with his biological father in a household of size 4 in a rural area. The presence of a strong familial support network could mitigate some risk factors. This factor is likely to have a positive impact on John's behavior.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally could indicate the influence of religious values and beliefs, which might encourage positive behaviors and reduce risk-taking.\n\nLet me summarize these thoughts into a structured format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may increase impulsivity but not necessarily recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on recidivism based on available data.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity/Religiosity\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"medium\", \"Average for age and ethnicity, no significant impact.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Limited education may affect employability but not necessarily behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Single job during the year may indicate employment difficulties but not necessarily recidivism\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Zero use in the past four years is a strong indicator of low risk\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"No recent depression indicates good mental health\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently stable, no immediate social pressures\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Strong familial support could mitigate some risks but not significant enough to override other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nThis assessment reflects a careful consideration of the available data and its implications on John's risk profile.",
