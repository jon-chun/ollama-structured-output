    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I'm going to approach this risk assessment step by step. First, I need to list all the factors provided and then assign a weight to each based on their perceived impact on the likelihood of a 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 20 years old.\n   - Age can be a factor in criminal behavior; younger individuals might be more impulsive or less aware of long-term consequences. However, at 20, they are likely mature enough to understand the impact of their actions.\n   \n2. **Race**: Black male.\n   - Race is known to influence sentencing and recidivism rates, with higher incarceration rates for Black males compared to other racial groups. This could be a significant factor.\n   \n3. **Arrest history**: Arrested twice, convicted.\n   - Having been arrested multiple times suggests a pattern of behavior or propensity towards criminal activity. Conviction indicates that the behavior was deemed serious enough to result in legal repercussions.\n   \n4. **Physical attributes**:\n   - Height and weight aren't typically relevant factors in recidivism assessments unless there are specific medical considerations.\n   \n5. **Marital status**: Never married, living alone.\n   - Marital status can sometimes be related to social support networks or personal stability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n   \n6. **Education**: GED certificate, not enrolled in college.\n   - Education level is generally linked to higher chances of employment and lower recidivism rates. A GED indicates some educational attainment, but not being enrolled in further education might suggest disengagement from formal learning.\n   \n7. **Employment history**: Held 1 job during the year.\n   - Employment status can be a factor; unemployed or underemployed individuals may have more time and opportunity to engage in criminal activities.\n   \n8. **Substance use**: No drug use in past four years.\n   - This is positive; no substance abuse suggests lower risk of involvement in criminal activities related to drugs.\n   \n9. **Mental health**: Not felt depressed over the past month.\n   - Mental health status can impact behavior, but not feeling depressed might indicate overall good mental well-being.\n   \n10. **Upbringing**: Lived with biological father in a household of size 3, rural area.\n    - The environment during upbringing can influence behavior, but specific details like being raised by a single parent or living in a rural area may have varying impacts.\n    \n11. **Belief system**: Considers God has something to do with personal experiences.\n    - This might suggest the person is religious and believes in divine intervention, which could provide social support and moral guidance.\n\nNow, I need to assign weights to these factors based on their perceived impact:\n\n- **Race**: High weight because of historical disparities in incarceration rates for Black males.\n  \n- **Arrest history**: Very high weight due to multiple arrests and convictions, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior.\n  \n- **Substance use**: Low weight since there's no drug use in the past four years.\n  \n- **Education and employment**: Medium weight; while important, these factors may not be as determinative as arrest history or race.\n  \n- **Marital status**: Low weight; marital status is generally not a strong predictor of recidivism.\n  \n- **Mental health**: Low weight unless there's evidence of current mental health issues that could lead to criminal behavior.\n  \n- **Upbringing and belief system**: Medium weight; these factors might provide social support or moral guidance, potentially reducing the risk of recidivism.\n\nNow, I need to consider how to combine these weights. In risk assessment models, often a composite score is calculated by multiplying each factor's impact with its assigned weight and summing them up. However, since I'm just assigning weights here, I'll assume that the final prediction will be based on a threshold of these weighted factors.\n\nGiven that this is a hypothetical scenario, I'll make some assumptions:\n\n- A higher overall score indicates a higher risk of recidivism.\n  \n- The weights should sum up to 1 for easy calculation, but in practice, they might need normalization.\n\nLet's assign the weights as follows:\n\n- Race: 0.2\n- Arrest history: 0.4\n- Substance use: 0.05\n- Education and employment: 0.1\n- Marital status: 0.05\n- Mental health: 0.05\n- Upbringing and belief system: 0.05\n\nNow, I need to assign a score for each factor:\n\n- **Race**: High weight but not necessarily indicative of all Black males being high risk; perhaps an average or slightly above-average.\n  - Score: 7/10\n  \n- **Arrest history**: Very high risk due to multiple arrests and convictions.\n  - Score: 9.5/10\n  \n- **Substance use**: No drug use in the past four years, which is positive.\n  - Score: 8/10\n  \n- **Education and employment**: GED but not enrolled in college; perhaps average educational attainment.\n  - Score: 6/10\n  \n- **Marital status**: Never married, living alone; likely average social support.\n  - Score: 5.5/10\n  \n- **Mental health**: Not depressed over the past month; good mental well-being.\n  - Score: 8/10\n  \n- **Upbringing and belief system**: Religious upbringing with a belief in divine intervention; potentially positive influence.\n  - Score: 7/10\n\nNow, calculate the weighted sum:\n\nTotal score = (0.2 * 7) + (0.4 * 9.5) + (0.05 * 8) + (0.1 * 6) + (0.05 * 5.5) + (0.05 * 8) + (0.05 * 7)\n\n= 1.4 + 3.8 + 0.4 + 0.6 + 0.275 + 0.4 + 0.35\n\n= 7.225/10\n\nGiven that a higher score indicates higher risk, and assuming that scores above 6 are considered high risk and below 5 as low risk, this would be medium to high risk.\n\nHowever, in recidivism prediction, sometimes a binary outcome is used based on whether the composite score exceeds a certain threshold. For example, if the threshold is 7, then it's high risk; below that, it's low risk.\n\nGiven my calculations, with a total score of 7.225, I would classify this as medium to high risk.\n\nBut since the question asks for YES or NO and a confidence level between 0 and 100%, perhaps a more nuanced approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, in some models, probabilities are assigned based on the composite score compared to normative data.\n\nGiven that, I'll assume that a score above 7 indicates a high risk of recidivism (YES), and below 7 indicates low risk (NO).\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Prediction: YES\n- Confidence: 80% (since 7.225 is slightly above the threshold of 7)\n\nSo, the final JSON object would be:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"historical disparities in incarceration rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"very high\", \"multiple arrests and convictions\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in past four years\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"GED but not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"never married, living alone\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"not depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"upbringing_and_belief_system\", \"medium\", \"religious upbringing with belief in divine intervention\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
