    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for a 20-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step and think about its impact on her future behavior.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender:\n- Age: 20 years old - This is relatively young, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk of recidivism unless there are other factors at play.\n- Gender: Female (Hispanic) - There isn't enough information to make a judgment call here. Gender alone doesn't typically predict recidivism in criminal cases.\n\nNext, let's look at her legal history:\n- Arrested once and convicted - This is a significant factor. Being arrested and convicted suggests that she has already engaged in behavior that led to legal consequences.\n- Current parole status: Unspecified (but convicted) - The fact that she has been convicted indicates a pattern of behavior that leads to criminal charges.\n\nNow, let's examine her personal background:\n- Household size at age 10 or younger: Size 4 - This suggests that she may have come from a larger family environment, which could potentially impact her life in ways not directly related to crime.\n- Education level: No high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college - Limited education can correlate with higher recidivism rates due to fewer job opportunities.\n- Employment history: Held 1 job during the year - This is a very short employment history, which could indicate difficulties in maintaining consistent employment.\n\nLet's consider her substance use:\n- Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) - Substance abuse can be a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially if it involves frequent drug use.\n- Current mental health status: Occasionally felt down but nothing could cheer her up - This could indicate underlying mental health issues that might affect behavior.\n\nFinally, let's think about her religious beliefs:\n- Believes God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally - This belief doesn't provide a clear indication of risk or protective factors related to recidivism.\n\nNow, let me compile these thoughts into a structured format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"A relatively young age does not necessarily indicate high risk, but it's important to consider other factors. The fact that she has been convicted suggests some level of maturity in her decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Limited information on gender as a predictor of recidivism alone. Other factors are more relevant.\"),\n    (\"Arrested and convicted\", \"high\", \"A conviction indicates a significant past criminal behavior, which can correlate with higher risk for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Household size at young age\", \"medium\", \"While having lived in a larger household may not directly impact recidivism, it could have influenced her life in ways that are not directly relevant to crime.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Limited education can affect job opportunities and potentially lead to higher risk behaviors if she finds herself without a stable source of income or support.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Short-term employment is a concern, as it may indicate difficulties in maintaining consistent work. This could impact her financial stability and potentially influence her behavior.\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"high\", \"Regular drug use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially if it involves frequent substance abuse. The mention of both marijuana and cocaine suggests a pattern of problematic substance use.\"),\n    (\"Current mental health status\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down but nothing could cheer her up might indicate underlying mental health issues that could affect behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis structured analysis allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the risk factors and provides a clear, well-reasoned prediction based on the given information.",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 138 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
