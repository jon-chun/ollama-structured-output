    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully consider each risk factor for the 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Let me break down my thought process step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start with his age. At 18 years old, he's a young adult still in transition. This means that impulsiveness and risk-taking behaviors might be more prevalent at this stage compared to older adults or juveniles. So, let's assign an \"medium\" weight to the factor of being under 25.\n\nNext, I'll consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once and convicted. The recency and severity of these incidents are crucial. Since he's only 18, this is a significant risk but not as severe as someone with multiple offenses over time. Therefore, I'll assign an \"medium\" weight to the factor of prior arrests.\n\nNow, let me think about his educational background. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This suggests that he's actively engaged in education and possibly seeking personal growth. However, the lack of recent job experience might indicate limited social support or financial stability. So, I'll assign an \"low\" weight to the factor of educational attainment.\n\nMoving on to his living situation. He is currently living alone with no family members present. This could potentially lead to a higher risk of substance abuse due to isolation and lack of accountability. Therefore, I'll assign an \"high\" weight to the factor of living situation.\n\nNext, let's consider his employment status. He has held no jobs during the year. Given that he's still in school and possibly seeking financial stability, this could indicate a higher risk of substance abuse or other criminal activities due to lack of social support. So, I'll assign an \"high\" weight to the factor of employment.\n\nNow, let me think about his drug use history. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This is a significant risk factor as it indicates a pattern of substance abuse that could lead to criminal activity. Therefore, I'll assign an \"high\" weight to the factor of substance use.\n\nNext, I'll consider his mental health status. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive but doesn't provide much insight into potential risk factors for recidivism. So, I'll assign a \"low\" weight to the factor of mental health.\n\nNow, let me think about his family background. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2 when he was younger. This could potentially influence his behavior and decision-making processes. Therefore, I'll assign an \"medium\" weight to the factor of family background.\n\nFinally, I'll consider his belief in divine intervention. His belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally might indicate a strong moral compass. However, this is somewhat subjective and doesn't provide concrete evidence for or against recidivism. So, I'll assign a \"low\" weight to the factor of spiritual beliefs.\n\nNow, let me compile all these factors into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Given his age at 18, impulsiveness and risk-taking behaviors might be more prevalent\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"The recency and severity of prior arrests suggest a moderate level of risk\"),\n    (\"educational_attainment\", \"low\", \"Although enrolled in college, limited recent employment experience suggests low social support\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone could lead to increased substance abuse due to isolation\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs indicate potential for substance abuse or other criminal activities\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Regular use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Lack of depressive feelings suggest low risk for mental health issues related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother at age 18 could influence behavior and decision-making processes\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine intervention is subjective and lacks concrete evidence for or against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis JSON object encapsulates the detailed analysis of each risk factor, providing a comprehensive assessment of the individual's likelihood to commit a crime within three years.",
