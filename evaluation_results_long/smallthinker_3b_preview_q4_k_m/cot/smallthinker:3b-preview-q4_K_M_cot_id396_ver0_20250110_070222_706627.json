    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given information and assign weights to each risk factor. Let me break down the factors one by one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the age of the individual. The person is 22 years old. At this age, there are many possibilities for development and growth. So, while youth can be a risk factor, it's not necessarily high in this context. I'll assign \"medium\" to this factor.\n\nNext, her race/ethnicity is White. This isn't typically a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Therefore, I'll mark this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's look at the number of arrests and convictions. The person has been arrested once and convicted. This is a clear indicator of prior criminal behavior, which could be a high-risk factor. So, I'll assign \"high\" to this.\n\nLiving with her biological father in a household of size 4 when she was young is an important point. Growing up in certain environments can have significant impacts on life choices and behaviors. This factor deserves a high weight as well.\n\nEducation level is another key factor. The person has only a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lower level of education, which can be a risk factor. However, it's important to note that education alone doesn't determine recidivism but can influence it. I'll assign \"medium\" to this.\n\nEmployment history shows she has held 3 jobs during the year. While having multiple job experiences can indicate stability and employability, it's not necessarily a high-risk factor in terms of recidivism. So, I'll mark this as \"low.\"\n\nDrug use is a critical factor. The person has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and recently felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates possible substance abuse issues, which can be a medium to high-risk factor depending on the severity of addiction and mental health issues. I'll assign \"medium\" here.\n\nReligious beliefs are another aspect. The person considers God has something to do with what happens to her personally. While faith can play a role in personal motivations and decision-making, it's not typically a significant factor in predicting recidivism. So, I'll mark this as \"low.\"\n\nLastly, mental health is an important consideration. Feeling so down that nothing could cheer her up suggests possible mental health issues. This factor deserves a medium weight.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and their weights:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"As a 22-year-old female, while youth can be a risk factor, it is not necessarily high in this context.\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Race/ethnicity is not typically a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"A history of arrest and conviction is a clear indicator of prior criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_with Biological_Dad\", \"high\", \"Growing up in certain environments can have significant impacts on life choices and behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having only a GED certificate and not enrolled in college indicates a lower level of education, which can be a risk factor but is not necessarily high.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"While having multiple job experiences can indicate stability and employability, it is not typically a high-risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Using drugs in the past four years, particularly marijuana, suggests possible substance abuse issues but is not necessarily high.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Faith can play a role in personal motivations and decision-making, but it is not typically a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling so down that nothing could cheer her up suggests possible mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
