    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the provided information and assign a relative weight to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age. The person is a 22-year-old female. Age is generally considered a neutral or slightly low-risk factor because it doesn't directly indicate criminal behavior but could influence other factors like education level and employment status. So, I would assign \"low\" to the age factor.\n\nNext, she has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. Arrests can be indicators of potential involvement in crime, especially if they occurred in close proximity. However, since there are no convictions, it suggests that these arrests might not directly translate into criminal behavior. Therefore, I would assign \"medium\" to the arrest factor.\n\nShe is 5 feet 7 inches tall and has never been married. Physical characteristics like height don't typically influence crime risk, so I'll assign \"low\" to the physical attributes factor.\n\nHer living situation as currently living alone might suggest a certain level of independence but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. So, I'll also assign \"low\" to the living situation factor.\n\nShe has never completed high school or college and hasn't held any jobs during the year. These factors are significant because they indicate limited education and job experience, which can be associated with increased risk of unemployment, homelessness, and potentially criminal activity. Therefore, I would assign \"high\" to both the education level and employment status factors.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) but has not felt depressed over the past month. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, but her lack of depression suggests that she might be managing her substance use effectively. Given this context, I would assign \"high\" to the drug use factor.\n\nHer history of living with her biological mother in a household of size 2 at a young age might indicate some level of family support or influence, which could potentially mitigate risk factors. However, since there's no direct correlation between this history and criminal behavior, I'll assign \"medium\" to this factor.\n\nConsidering her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally is more related to spirituality than specific actions indicative of crime. Therefore, I would assign \"low\" to the spiritual belief factor.\n\nNow, let's compile these factors into a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age being 22 years old does not directly correlate with criminal behavior, but it is important to consider other factors such as education and employment.\"),\n    (\"arrested\", \"high\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest potential involvement in crime, especially if they occurred close together. However, this factor can be mitigated by considering the lack of convictions and other risk factors.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes like height do not typically influence crime risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Never married does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not necessarily indicate criminal behavior, but it could be a factor in other areas such as employment and education.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate indicates limited educational attainment, which can increase risk of unemployment and potentially criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year suggests potential unemployment issues, which can be correlated with increased crime risk due to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior. However, the lack of depression over the past month suggests effective management of substance use.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 2 at a young age may indicate some level of family support or influence, but this factor does not directly correlate to crime risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nThis JSON object encapsulates the analysis and prediction based on the given information.",
