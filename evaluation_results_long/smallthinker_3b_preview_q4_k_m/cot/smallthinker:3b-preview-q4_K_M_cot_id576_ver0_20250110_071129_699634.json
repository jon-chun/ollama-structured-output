    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested once and convicted, is married, and has held four jobs in the past year. Additionally, she has used drugs in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. At an early age, she lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 4, and she believes that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Age at First Arrest**: The person was arrested at the age of 21. This is relatively late, but it still indicates a history of criminal behavior. I'll assign this a high weight because it's significant.\n   \n   (\"age_at_first_arrest\", \"high\", \"The fact that she was arrested at such an age suggests that she may be more likely to continue engaging in criminal activities.\")\n\n2. **Convicted**: She has been convicted, which is clear evidence of past criminal behavior. This factor should have a very high weight.\n\n   (\"convicted\", \"very_high\", \"Conviction is a strong indicator of future criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like age at first arrest and job history.\")\n\n3. **Education Level**: She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n\n   (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Limited education may limit her career options and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities to support herself.\")\n\n4. **Employment History**: She has held four jobs in the past year, which is relatively low compared to the general population. This might indicate a lack of stability or potential for job-related stress.\n\n   (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"The fact that she has held multiple jobs suggests she may be at risk due to instability and potentially poor job performance.\")\n\n5. **Drug Use**: She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. This is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n\n   (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a clear indicator of substance abuse issues that may contribute to criminal behavior.\")\n\n6. **Depression History**: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. However, this factor has no weight assigned in our model.\n\n   (\"depression_history\", \"no_weight_assigned\", \"The person reports not feeling depressed recently, so this factor does not apply.\")\n\n7. **Home Environment**: At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 4. This could indicate unstable living conditions and potential exposure to negative influences.\n\n   (\"home_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents may expose her to negative influences and potentially contribute to criminal behavior.\")\n\n8. **Belief in Divine Intervention**: Her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally is a strong factor for recidivism. This suggests she might be more likely to act on divine guidance, which can sometimes lead to harmful actions.\n\n   (\"divine_intervention\", \"high\", \"The person's belief in divine intervention may influence her actions and contribute to recidivism.\")\n\nNow, let me summarize the risk factors:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_at_first_arrest\", \"high\", \"The fact that she was arrested at such an age suggests that she may be more likely to continue engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"convicted\", \"very_high\", \"Conviction is a strong indicator of future criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like age at first arrest and job history.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Limited education may limit her career options and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities to support herself.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"The fact that she has held multiple jobs suggests she may be at risk due to instability and potentially poor job performance.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a clear indicator of substance abuse issues that may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"depression_history\", \"no_weight_assigned\", \"The person reports not feeling depressed recently, so this factor does not apply.\"),\n    (\"home_environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents may expose her to negative influences and potentially contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"divine_intervention\", \"high\", \"The person's belief in divine intervention may influence her actions and contribute to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
