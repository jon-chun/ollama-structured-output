    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high-risk individual. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information: he is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. These details seem relatively neutral at first glance. Wait, let me check if there are any specific characteristics or behaviors that could indicate higher risk... \n\nUpon reviewing his arrest and conviction history, it appears that he has been arrested once and convicted. This is an important factor to consider, as past criminal behavior can be a significant indicator of future risk. Let me think about how this might impact my overall assessment...\n\nNext, I'll consider his physical characteristics: he stands 6 feet 0 inches tall and weighs 212 lbs. These measurements are within the normal range, so they don't immediately suggest any specific risks. However, let's not overlook the possibility that certain physical traits could be associated with higher risk behaviors or tendencies.\n\nMoving on to his personal life, I note that he has never been married and is currently living alone. This information alone doesn't provide much insight into potential risk factors. But wait a minute... considering his lack of employment during the year, this might indicate some level of dependency or difficulty in maintaining stable relationships with others.\n\nNow, let's examine his education and drug usage history. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college, which suggests he is likely pursuing higher education. However, his history of using drugs in the past four years (specifically marijuana) is a significant risk factor. This ongoing substance use could potentially impact his decision-making abilities or lead to further legal issues.\n\nFurthermore, his self-reported feelings of depression over the past month are not present, which is generally positive. But let me think about this in the context of the overall information... the absence of current depressive symptoms doesn't necessarily negate the importance of considering substance use and other risk factors.\n\nThe fact that he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 6 during his younger years could also be relevant, as it might indicate experiences that have shaped his life in certain ways. And at the age of 10 or so, having God's guidance as part of his personal belief system is an interesting aspect to consider.\n\nAs I weigh all these factors together... I'm starting to see a complex picture emerge. The combination of past criminal behavior, substance use, and other lifestyle choices does suggest potential higher risk behaviors. However, let me assess my confidence level in this assessment...\n\nGiven the information provided and considering each factor carefully, it seems reasonable to conclude that this individual does indeed exhibit characteristics or habits that could indicate a high-risk profile.\n\nTherefore, after thorough analysis and consideration of all the given risk factors, I can confidently provide my assessment. The prediction is \"YES\" indicating high risk, with a confidence level of 85% based on the detailed evaluation of his background, behaviors, and personal circumstances.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
