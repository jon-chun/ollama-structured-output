    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the demographics of the individual in question. She is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. Wait, let me check what kind of impact her age and racial background might have on her risk profile. Since she's relatively young and doesn't appear to be from an area with high crime rates or socioeconomic issues, I'll place this aspect at the lower end of my analysis.\n\nNext, I'll look into her legal history. She has been arrested once but has not been convicted. Let me think about this for a moment... The fact that she's only been arrested once and hasn't been convicted already could be seen as somewhat mitigating factors. However, given the lack of conviction, it still raises some concerns. I'll assign this aspect an intermediate score.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical attributes: height, weight, marital status, living situation, education level, employment history, substance use history, and personal beliefs. These are quite a range of factors. Let me break them down one by one. \n\nFor the substance use history, especially considering she has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up... This is definitely concerning and points towards higher risk.\n\nRegarding her personal beliefs, particularly about God not having anything to do with what happens to her personally... This seems to indicate a lower level of empathy or understanding of societal norms. I'll also rate this as relatively low impact.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, it seems that the combination of her substance use history and some aspects of her personal life are contributing significantly to a higher risk profile. Let me calculate my confidence level based on this analysis... Given the complexity and the range of factors involved, I'm inclined to say my confidence is moderate, perhaps around 60-70%.\n\nBut wait, I need to ensure that my prediction is clear and concise. After careful consideration, I believe it's appropriate to predict a high risk level for this individual.\n\nTherefore, after thorough analysis and weighing all the factors, my refined answer is:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
