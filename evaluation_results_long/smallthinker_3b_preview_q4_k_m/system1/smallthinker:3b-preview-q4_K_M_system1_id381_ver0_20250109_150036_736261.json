    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this scenario here. Let's see, I need to assess the risk level based on these factors. Okay, first things first, the person is a 19-year-old male, identified as White. So, demographics are clear. He's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That could be significant, but since it's not confirmed, maybe it's not an immediate red flag.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 155 lbs. Physical attributes don't seem to indicate any violent tendencies or anything like that. He's never been married and lives alone now. So, living situation might be relevant if there are family issues or substance abuse affecting him, but he seems to have a stable living arrangement.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. That suggests he's getting an education, which could be positive for his future prospects and perhaps indicates that he's not too far removed from the law enforcement community. Maybe it's easier for him to relate to others who are educated.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. That might suggest some instability or maybe just a preference for studying over working, but overall, it doesn't seem like a major issue.\n\nNow, he's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Legal status aside, drug use can be a risk factor in itself, especially if there are patterns of frequent use or involvement with other substances that aren't mentioned here. Also, at some point, he felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. That sounds like depression symptoms, which is another red flag.\n\nAdditionally, he's had to live with both biological parents and their family of size 5 in a rural area when he was younger. Living in large families can sometimes lead to social issues or difficulties adjusting to smaller living spaces later on, but again, it doesn't directly indicate criminal behavior unless there are specific incidents related to this upbringing.\n\nLastly, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This seems more like a belief system and might not be directly relevant to his risk assessment, unless perhaps he seeks guidance or support from religious institutions, which could be beneficial or potentially problematic in certain contexts.\n\nOkay, so let's think about this step by step. First, the arrest without conviction\u2014well, it's just one time, but it does indicate some level of involvement with the criminal justice system. Maybe there are underlying issues that led to his involvement in crime.\n\nSecond, drug use: marijuana is legal in many places, but using drugs can still be a factor depending on the severity and frequency. Depression symptoms add another layer; someone experiencing depression might engage in impulsive behaviors or have poor judgment, which could lead to criminal actions.\n\nThe living situation\u2014being raised in a large family and now living alone could indicate some degree of adjustment issues, but again, it's not directly relevant unless there are specific incidents related to this background.\n\nAnd finally, his belief in God might suggest that he seeks support from religious groups or organizations, which could be positive for counseling or other resources, but it could also potentially lead to involvement with extremist groups if certain beliefs are extreme.\n\nPutting all these factors together, I would say that there are some risk factors present here, particularly the drug use and the arrest. However, given that he's enrolled in college and has a high school diploma, it suggests that he's trying to make positive steps in his life.\n\nAlso, depression symptoms could be addressed with proper mental health treatment, which might help reduce the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nSo, overall, I'd rate this as a moderate risk scenario. There are some factors that warrant attention, but not to the point where it becomes high risk immediately.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is NO for high risk.\n\nAnd based on these considerations, my confidence level would be around 70%. It's not a definitive call, but given the mix of positive and negative factors, I'm moderately confident in this assessment.\n\nSo, the JSON object would look like this:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}",
