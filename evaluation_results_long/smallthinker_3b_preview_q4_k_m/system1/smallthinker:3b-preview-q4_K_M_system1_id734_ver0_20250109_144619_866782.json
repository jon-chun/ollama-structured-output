    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual described.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step. First, let's list out all the factors we're considering:\n\n1. The person is 21 years old.\n2. He identifies as White.\n3. He has been arrested four times and convicted.\n4. His physical attributes: height (5'10\"), weight (215 lbs).\n5. Personal life: never married, living alone.\n6. Education: high school diploma, enrolled in a 2-year college.\n7. Employment: no jobs during the year.\n8. Substance use: used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), and for some time in the past month felt so down that nothing could cheer him up.\n9. Family background: lived in a household of size 6 at a young age.\n10. Belief system: considers God irrelevant to personal life.\n\nNow, let's break this down further:\n\n- Arrested four times and convicted: This is a significant factor indicating past criminal behavior. It suggests a history of law-breaking.\n- Substance use: Using drugs in the past four years, and for some time feeling severely depressed. This could indicate potential substance abuse issues and mental health concerns.\n- Lack of employment or education advancement: Not having jobs or advancing academically might suggest instability or lack of direction.\n\nWait, let me check if these factors alone can classify this as a high-risk profile. Given the combination of past criminal behavior, drug use, and lack of educational or occupational progress, it seems plausible that this individual could pose a higher risk compared to the general population.\n\nLet's consider the confidence level. The factors provided are quite substantial indicators of potential future criminal activity or negative outcomes. However, the information is not exhaustive, and there might be other mitigating factors not mentioned here.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that these risk factors do suggest a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
