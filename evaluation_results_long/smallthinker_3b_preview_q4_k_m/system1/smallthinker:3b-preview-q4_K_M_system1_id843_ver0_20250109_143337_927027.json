    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully evaluate the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for an individual who is a 19-year-old male identifying as White, with various personal and behavioral characteristics. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider the fact that the person has been arrested multiple times - specifically, 8 arrests with convictions. This history of criminal activity could be a significant risk factor. Wait, let me check if there are any other relevant factors... Yes, it's also important to note his age, height, weight range, and living situation, as these might influence the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities.\n\nLet's break down each aspect:\n- **Personal Information**: The person is 19 years old, male, White, stands at 5 feet 10 inches tall, weighs between 150 and 174 lbs, has never been married, lives alone, holds a high school diploma, and has no college enrollment. These details provide context but may not directly indicate risk unless combined with other factors.\n- **Behavioral Factors**: He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and felt so down that nothing could cheer him up during some periods. This history of drug use and emotional distress could suggest vulnerability to substance abuse or mental health issues, which are known risk factors for criminal behavior.\n- **Family Background**: The fact that he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 6 at an early age might indicate difficulties with family relationships, potentially influencing his later interactions with law enforcement or the legal system.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together... The combination of multiple arrests, drug use, past convictions for similar offenses (though not explicitly stated), and the history of living in large households as a child seems quite alarming. It suggests a pattern of behavior that could lead to further criminal activity. \n\nLet me think about the confidence level in this assessment... Given the weight of these factors - multiple arrests, drug use over several years, emotional distress, and potentially strained family relationships - I would rate my confidence in predicting high risk as very high. This is because each factor contributes independently or collectively to a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nWait a minute... Before finalizing, let me consider if there are any mitigating factors that might reduce the predicted risk level. For instance, while he has been arrested and convicted, it's also true that not all arrests lead to convictions, and some individuals may have had similar experiences without turning to crime. However, given the combination of multiple arrests, drug use, and other risk factors, these seem to point towards a higher likelihood of continued criminal behavior.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the prediction should be based on the overall assessment of these risk factors. \n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
