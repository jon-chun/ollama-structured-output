    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided for the individual in question. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest and conviction history. The person has been arrested once and convicted. This is a clear indication of criminal activity, which could be a significant risk factor. However, it's important to remember that one instance might not fully define their risk profile.\n\nNext, I'll examine his physical characteristics: height (6 feet 1 inch), weight (155 lbs). These are typical and don't seem to pose any significant risks on their own.\n\nMoving on to his educational background, he has a GED certificate and is currently enrolled in a 4-year college. This suggests that he has some level of education and is actively pursuing further learning. While this might not directly correlate with criminal behavior, it's important to consider the broader context.\n\nRegarding employment, he has held no jobs during the year. This could be a concern as it indicates a lack of work experience or financial stability. However, it's also possible that he is taking time off for education or other reasons, which would need further investigation.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor: he has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. The use of drugs can be a significant risk indicator, but the lack of depression suggests that his mental health might be stable at this point.\n\nLiving situation: he lives alone after having lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3. This transition could potentially lead to emotional or psychological challenges, which are important to consider.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is an interesting aspect. It might indicate a lack of moral compass or a different worldview, but it's also possible that this perspective is well-intentioned and doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nLet me check the overall picture now. The combination of arrest history, drug use, and living situation are all significant risk factors. However, the educational background and current enrollment in college suggest some level of maturity and a commitment to learning. Additionally, his belief about God might indicate that he is not seeking external validation for his actions.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can conclude that while there are several risk factors present, they do not fully define the individual as high risk. There are mitigating factors such as education and a potentially positive outlook on life that suggest he may not be actively involved in criminal activities at this time.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
