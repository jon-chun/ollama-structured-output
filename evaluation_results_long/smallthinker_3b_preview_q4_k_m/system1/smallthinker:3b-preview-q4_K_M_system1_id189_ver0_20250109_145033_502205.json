    "raw_message_text": "To answer this:\n\n\"I need to analyze these risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for the individual in question. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor and assess its relevance to criminal behavior. I'll start with the most obvious indicators of risk.\n\nThe person has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. This is a significant red flag. Arrests without convictions suggest a pattern of potentially problematic behavior that could lead to future crimes. Let me check if this factor alone raises enough concern to indicate high risk.\n\nNext, I'll consider his marital status and living situation. He's married and living with his spouse, which seems to indicate stability and possibly support from family. However, the fact that he has not held any jobs during the year is a concerning factor. Unemployment can be linked to various criminal behaviors, so this needs more attention.\n\nNow, let's look at his education and personal beliefs. He holds a high school diploma and considers God to have something to do with what happens to him personally. These factors don't immediately point towards a high risk of crime, but they could indicate a different set of motivations or values that might influence behavior in unexpected ways.\n\nThe most striking factor, however, is his history of using drugs in the past four years and not feeling depressed over the past month. This suggests a lack of emotional distress, which might affect decision-making and impulsivity. These factors are crucial for assessing risk.\n\nLet me break down the confidence level. Given the pattern of arrests without convictions and the lack of recent depression or substance abuse-related issues, I believe these factors significantly increase the likelihood of high-risk behavior. However, his marital status, education, and personal beliefs somewhat mitigate this.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the risk factors indicate a high risk profile. The combination of arrest history and drug use without depression is particularly concerning.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\"",
