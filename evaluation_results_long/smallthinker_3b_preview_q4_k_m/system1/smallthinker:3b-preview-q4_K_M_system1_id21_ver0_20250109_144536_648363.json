    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for a criminal offense. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest and conviction history. He has been arrested three times and convicted once. This is a significant factor indicating potential recidivism. Wait, let me check the frequency - it seems quite high for someone who should be on probation or parole. This definitely points towards a higher risk profile.\n\nNext, his age and gender are straightforward. A 22-year-old male might not inherently suggest high risk unless there's other evidence to support that. However, given the context of arrest and conviction history, it does suggest some level of risk.\n\nHis physical attributes - height and weight - don't seem particularly relevant to risk assessment in this context. They are more related to health and fitness, which aren't directly pertinent here.\n\nMarriage status is also not directly relevant to criminal behavior unless there's a specific connection I'm missing. It doesn't seem to play a significant role in the analysis of these factors.\n\nEducation level - having a GED certificate but not enrolled in college might indicate some educational attainment and possibly a lower socioeconomic status. This could be a factor, as lower education levels sometimes correlate with higher crime rates. However, it's not definitive on its own.\n\nEmployment history shows he has held only one job during the year, which might suggest unemployment or instability. Unemployment can often lead to financial strain and desperation, which could influence criminal behavior. This is another relevant factor.\n\nSubstance use - past four years of marijuana use and recent feelings of depression could indicate mental health issues that might predispose him to criminal behavior. Substance abuse and mental health problems are known risk factors for crime.\n\nLiving in a household of size 4 at an early age could suggest family dynamics that may have influenced his behavior. This is more about social environment than immediate risk, but it's still relevant.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally seems unrelated to criminal behavior unless there's a specific theological context suggesting otherwise. It doesn't appear to be a direct indicator of high risk in this scenario.\n\nLet me summarize these points and assign confidence levels:\n\n- Arrest/Conviction History: High Risk\n- Age/Male: Moderate Risk (given the arrest history)\n- Physical Attributes: Low Risk\n- Marriage Status: Low Risk\n- Education Level: Moderate Risk\n- Employment History: Moderate Risk\n- Substance Use: High Risk\n- Household Size: Moderate Risk\n- Belief in Divine Intervention: Low Risk\n\nNow, let's combine these into a JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nThis reflects my analysis and the calculated confidence level based on the risk factors provided.",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
