    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the provided risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 22 years old. This is a relatively young age, but it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior without other context.\n- Race: Black. I need to remember that race alone is not a significant indicator of risk unless combined with other factors like arrest history or previous convictions.\n\nNext, let's look at the arrest and conviction record:\n- Arrested once, convicted. This suggests some level of involvement in illegal activities, which is a strong factor pointing towards high risk.\n- Previous convictions are typically associated with higher recidivism rates, indicating a potential for repeated criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's examine the personal history:\n- Physical attributes: 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 178 lbs. These details don't directly correlate with criminal risk without additional context.\n- Living situation: Currently living alone, never married. This might suggest some level of independence or possibly a lack of support system, but it doesn't directly indicate high risk.\n- Education and employment: GED certificate, not enrolled in college, no jobs during the year. These factors could be indicators of limited opportunities or challenges, which might correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nMoving on to substance use:\n- Used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. This is a significant factor as drug use can often lead to involvement in illegal activities and may indicate potential for further criminal behavior.\n- No feelings of depression over the past month. This suggests that mental health issues are not currently a major concern, which is a positive sign but doesn't negate other risk factors.\n\nFinally, let's consider the childhood experiences:\n- Lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 4, urban area. This could indicate some level of instability or potential for exposure to negative influences that might affect behavior.\n- Belief in God having something to do with personal life events. This is an interesting factor but doesn't directly correlate with criminal risk without further context.\n\nNow, let me synthesize all these factors:\n- The conviction and arrest history are strong indicators of high risk.\n- Substance use is another significant factor.\n- The lack of a support system and limited education might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nLet me think... after considering all these factors, I can confidently say that the overall risk profile suggests a high likelihood of involvement in criminal activities. Therefore, my prediction is YES, indicating high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
