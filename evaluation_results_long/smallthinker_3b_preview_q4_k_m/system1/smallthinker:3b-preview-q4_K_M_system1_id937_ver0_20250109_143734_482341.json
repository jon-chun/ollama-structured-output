    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll examine her criminal history - she has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor, as past behavior often indicates future actions. Wait, let me check the severity of these convictions... Since both incidents are mentioned, it suggests a pattern of non-compliance with the law, which could indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nNext, I'll consider her employment history - she has held only one job during the year. This limited work experience might reflect difficulties in maintaining stable employment, which could be related to other factors such as substance abuse or personal issues. Let me think about how this relates to the overall picture... While unemployment can happen to anyone, it's often a symptom of underlying problems.\n\nNow, let's look at her educational background - she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This lack of formal education could limit her career opportunities and might contribute to feelings of dissatisfaction or low self-esteem. Hmm... I wonder how this affects her decision-making processes or understanding of the consequences of her actions.\n\nThe fact that she has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, is another crucial factor. Substance abuse can lead to impaired judgment, increased risk-taking behavior, and potential legal issues. Let me consider how often she's been using... Since most of the time during the past month she felt \"so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up,\" it suggests a pattern of significant substance use and associated mental health concerns.\n\nHer living situation is also important - she's currently married to her spouse but has lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 when she was younger. This indicates family history, which might influence her behavior and decision-making. Wait a minute... The mention of God having something to do with what happens to her personally could indicate the presence of religious beliefs or values that shape her worldview. However, I'm not sure how to quantify this factor in terms of risk.\n\nLastly, considering all these factors together - her criminal history, limited employment experience, lack of education, substance abuse history, and personal beliefs... It seems that while individual factors contribute, there's a cumulative effect that suggests she might be at a higher risk. Let me summarize my thoughts... \n\nGiven the complexity and the weight of these factors, I'm inclined to predict a high level of risk associated with her behavior. My confidence in this prediction is based on the severity and frequency of the risk factors presented.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
