    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the information step-by-step.\n\nFirst, the person's age and race are given as 21 years old and Black. While these factors can be relevant in certain contexts, they alone do not necessarily indicate a high risk of criminal behavior. So, let's move on to other details.\n\nNext, we have her arrest record: she has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor indicating past involvement with the legal system, which could suggest some level of antisocial behavior or substance abuse issues. However, it doesn't necessarily mean she will be involved in criminal activities again.\n\nShe is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. Body weight can sometimes be relevant in certain contexts, such as when considering physical capabilities for violent crimes. Yet, without more specific information on her build or any history of physical violence, this factor does not strongly indicate a high risk.\n\nHer marital status is that she has never been married and is currently living alone. This could potentially suggest some level of social isolation, which might be related to antisocial behavior or substance abuse issues. However, it's important to note that living alone can also be a normal part of life for many individuals without any correlation to criminal activity.\n\nShe does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This could indicate some level of educational disadvantage, which might correlate with lower socioeconomic status and potentially higher crime rates. However, education alone is not a definitive indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nShe has held no jobs during the year. Lack of employment history can suggest financial instability or issues that may lead to involvement with the law. Nevertheless, this factor alone does not strongly indicate a high risk without additional context.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. These factors are highly indicative of substance abuse issues and potential mental health problems, which can be correlated with higher rates of criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This background information suggests that she may have been exposed to different environments or circumstances that could have influenced her behavior. However, without more specific details on the nature of her living situation and its impact on her life choices, this factor does not strongly indicate a high risk.\n\nLastly, she considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This belief system can sometimes influence an individual's actions and decisions, potentially leading to certain types of criminal behavior. However, without more specific information on how this belief system correlates with past or potential future criminal activity, this factor does not strongly indicate a high risk.\n\nLet me think about all these factors together. The combination of her arrest record, substance abuse history, and lack of education suggests that she may be at higher risk of engaging in criminal behavior. However, without definitive evidence linking these factors to actual criminal activities, it's important to consider the broader context and potential mitigating factors.\n\nWait a minute... after carefully analyzing all the provided information, I can confidently say that while some indicators suggest a higher risk profile, others do not strongly support such a conclusion. Therefore, my final assessment is that these risk factors indicate a moderate level of risk rather than high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
