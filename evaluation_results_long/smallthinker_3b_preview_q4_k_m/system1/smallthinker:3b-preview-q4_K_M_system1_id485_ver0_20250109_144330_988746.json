    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the information step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his demographic information. The person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. At first glance, these factors don't necessarily suggest a high risk of criminal behavior. However, I need to remember that age and race alone do not determine risk; they are just part of the broader picture.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is an important factor. Arrests can indicate potential involvement with law enforcement or other legal issues, which might suggest a higher risk profile. Let me think about this further - while a single arrest does not necessarily mean high risk, it certainly raises some red flags.\n\nHis physical characteristics are also noteworthy. He stands 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. These details could be useful in certain contexts, such as if there's a need to assess potential physical capabilities for specific crimes. However, they don't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nLiving alone and being currently enrolled in school are generally positive indicators of stability and less involvement with the law. This suggests that he might have a lower risk profile due to his current situation.\n\nHis employment history is quite limited. He has held only one job during the year. This could be seen as a potential risk factor, as it might indicate instability or lack of commitment. However, without more context about the nature of this job and any legal issues related to it, it's hard to draw a definitive conclusion.\n\nHis drug use history is also significant. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up during the past month. These factors can be indicators of mental health issues or substance abuse problems, which are often linked to increased risk behaviors. The mention of feeling \"down\" without cheerfulness suggests a possible emotional distress, which could be a red flag.\n\nHis history of living in a household of size 4 at an early age is another important factor. This might suggest potential exposure to multiple stressors or influences during childhood, which could have impacted his development and behavior. It's not directly linked to criminal behavior but adds complexity to the picture.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a strong sense of individualism and possibly low regard for authority figures or societal norms. This could be seen as a potential risk factor, as it might suggest a higher likelihood of non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nLet me check the overall picture now. Given all these factors, especially his arrest, limited employment history, drug use history, emotional distress, and strong sense of individualism, I can see that there are indeed several red flags here.\n\nWait a minute... After careful consideration, it seems clear that while no single factor alone suggests high risk, the combination of an arrest, limited employment, drug use history, emotional distress, and a strong sense of individualism does indicate a higher risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer: {\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
