    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they contribute to the overall assessment of this individual's potential for engaging in criminal behavior. Let me break down each factor step-by-step and think about its implications.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. Age and gender can be significant factors, but I need to look deeper into other aspects before making any judgments.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once and convicted. This is a serious offense, indicating some level of criminal history. Let me think... while this is concerning, it's important to consider the context and the severity of the offenses committed.\n\nHis physical characteristics are straightforward: 5 feet 8 inches tall and 143 pounds. These details don't directly impact risk assessment but can be used for identification purposes.\n\nLiving alone and never being married might suggest a certain level of independence, which could either foster or hinder criminal behavior depending on various factors. It's not immediately clear how this affects the risk score.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates some educational attainment but no current academic focus. Let me check... while education can be a mitigating factor, it doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal activity without further context.\n\nThe fact that he has held two jobs during the year suggests a level of stability and employment history, which could indicate financial means or motivation to avoid crime. However, this alone does not provide enough insight into his likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior.\n\nUsing drugs in the past four years (marijuana) is a significant factor. Drug use can be indicative of substance abuse issues, which may correlate with impulsivity and risk-taking behaviors. This needs careful consideration.\n\nFeeling so down that nothing could cheer him up at some point indicates emotional distress or depression. Depression can sometimes lead to impulsive decisions, which might increase the risk of criminal behavior. Let me think... this is a critical factor that warrants attention.\n\nThe fact that he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2 in an urban area provides context for his social environment. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and more opportunities for criminal activity. This could be a contributing factor to the risk assessment.\n\nFinally, considering that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is a strong indicator of a sense of spirituality or moral compass. However, it does not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless this spiritual belief influences his values in a way that encourages or discourages crime. This needs careful consideration.\n\nLet me summarize my thoughts: the combination of drug use, emotional distress, and living in an urban area suggests a higher risk profile. The sense of spirituality might provide some protective factors, but it's not sufficient to outweigh the other indicators.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
