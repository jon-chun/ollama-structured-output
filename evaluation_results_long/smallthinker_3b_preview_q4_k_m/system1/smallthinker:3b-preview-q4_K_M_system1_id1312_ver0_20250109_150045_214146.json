    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and ethnicity: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. This information alone doesn't provide significant insight into his criminal risk profile. Age can be relevant in certain contexts, but without more context, it's hard to see a direct correlation with high-risk behavior.\n\nNext, let's look at his arrest record: He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. This is an important point, as past arrests can be indicative of future criminal activity, especially if the individual has shown no signs of remorse or rehabilitation in the intervening period.\n\nHis physical attributes and living situation are also noteworthy. At 5 feet 11 inches and weighing 158 lbs, he fits within a typical weight range. Living alone without any children suggests a certain level of independence, but again, this doesn't directly correlate with high-risk behavior.\n\nEducation and employment status are crucial indicators. The individual has never been married, is currently living alone, does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, and has held no jobs during the year. These factors suggest a lack of stability and potential for financial instability, which can sometimes lead to criminal activity as a means of survival.\n\nHis substance use history is another significant factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), but he has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that while he may have engaged in drug use, there's no current mental health crisis or suicidal ideation, which reduces the immediate risk of violent crime.\n\nThe most critical aspect is his background living with his biological mother in a household of size 11 in a rural area. Such an environment can expose individuals to various challenges and potentially influence their behavior. However, without knowing the nature of these challenges, it's hard to draw a direct link to high-risk behavior.\n\nLastly, the belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a lack of moral or ethical guidance. This could suggest a higher potential for criminal behavior if he feels no accountability from societal norms or religious beliefs.\n\nLet me check my analysis again. After considering all these factors, I realize that while some risk indicators are present, they don't collectively paint a picture of imminent high-risk behavior. The individual's lack of conviction after the arrest and his current stable living situation suggest a level of self-control.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
