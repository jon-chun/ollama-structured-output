    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high-risk profile for a criminal offense. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information provided:\n- The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n- He has been arrested once but has not been convicted.\n- His physical attributes include height of 5 feet 7 inches and weight between 125 and 149 lbs.\n- He has never been married and is currently living alone.\n- Educational background: no high school diploma or GED certificate, not enrolled in college.\n- Employment history: held only one job during the year.\n- Substance use: used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but does not feel depressed over the past month.\n- Family history: lived in a household of size 5 at a young age.\n- Belief system: considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nNow, let's analyze these factors one by one. The most concerning factor seems to be his substance use history and lack of education or college enrollment. These could indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to criminal activity.\n\nLet me check the arrest record again. Since he has been arrested once but not convicted, it suggests some level of involvement with law enforcement, which is a red flag. The fact that he does not feel depressed over the past month also makes his profile less likely to be classified as high risk.\n\nWait, let me think about this carefully. While he has no prior conviction, the combination of his substance use history and limited education or job experience suggests potential instability and vulnerability to criminal activity. Additionally, his belief in a higher power might not directly influence his behavior but could indicate some level of moral compass that is missing in many at-risk individuals.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I believe he does have some risk indicators. However, the lack of conviction and current emotional stability somewhat mitigate this risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
