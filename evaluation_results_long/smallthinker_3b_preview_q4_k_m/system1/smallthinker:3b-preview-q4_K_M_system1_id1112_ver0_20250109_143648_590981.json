    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided for the individual in question. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and race. At 19 years old, he is still a young adult, which might suggest potential vulnerability or impulsivity. However, being Black does not directly correlate with criminal behavior without further context. Wait a minute, this factor alone doesn't seem to indicate high risk.\n\nNext, his arrest record. He has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This could be seen as a red flag, suggesting some level of involvement in illegal activities. But let me check the specifics - he hasn't been convicted yet, so it's still unclear. I'll need to consider this more carefully later.\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. No additional information suggests these factors could contribute significantly to a high-risk profile without further context.\n\nLiving situation-wise, he is currently living alone and has never been married. This doesn't seem particularly risky on its own. However, the mention of having lived in a household with two people at a young age adds a layer of complexity. Let me think about this - it could indicate some level of family instability or potential exposure to adverse environments.\n\nEducation-wise, he holds a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests that he has completed high school but may not have pursued higher education. While this doesn't directly point to criminal behavior, it might suggest a lack of long-term planning or educational attainment.\n\nEmployment history shows that he has held two jobs during the year. This could indicate some level of responsibility and financial stability. However, let me check - holding two jobs might also suggest a need for income to support personal needs, which isn't necessarily indicative of criminal activity.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. This is very positive and suggests that he is currently stable and not using substances or experiencing depression, which are often linked to criminal behavior.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally might indicate a certain level of self-reliance or independence. However, let me consider this - it doesn't necessarily suggest high risk; in fact, it could indicate a strong sense of personal responsibility and autonomy.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I can see that while some factors raise concerns about potential involvement in illegal activities or family instability, the overall picture suggests that he is not likely to be involved in high-risk criminal behavior. The lack of conviction, stable living situation, no substance use, and positive mental health indicators support this conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
