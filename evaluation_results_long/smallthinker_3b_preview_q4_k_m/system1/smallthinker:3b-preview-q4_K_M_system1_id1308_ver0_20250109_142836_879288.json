    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to assess and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nFirst up, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and race can be important factors in assessing risk, but alone, they don't necessarily suggest anything beyond general statistics. In criminal justice, there's a trend towards being cautious with minority groups due to implicit biases, but it's not specific enough on its own.\n\nNext, he's been arrested twice and has convictions. That's pretty serious. Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of behavior that may include criminal activity. This is a significant risk factor for future offenses or involvement in similar activities.\n\nHis physical attributes: 5 feet 9 inches, 145 lbs. Nothing out of the ordinary there. Probably just average height and weight. No relevance to risk assessment unless perhaps he has any physical limitations that might affect his ability to commit certain crimes, but even then, it's not a major factor.\n\nLiving situation: never been married, living alone. Again, this is more about personal life than criminal behavior, unless there are underlying issues contributing to his decision to live alone or his lack of marital history, but without more context, it's hard to see how this directly relates to risk.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. This suggests he may have some educational gaps and possibly a higher likelihood of unemployment or lower-paying jobs. While this can influence behavior\u2014less likely to be employed in stable positions\u2014it doesn't necessarily mean he's at high risk for criminal activity unless there are other factors.\n\nEmployment: has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might drive people towards crime if they feel desperate. This is a red flag and definitely increases risk.\n\nSubstance use: not used any drugs in the past four years, but most of the time during the past month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests he may be experiencing depression or some form of mental distress. Mental health issues can sometimes lead individuals to engage in criminal behavior as a cry for help or due to impulsiveness associated with certain conditions.\n\nAdditionally, his living situation at a young age: lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, urban area. This might indicate a difficult upbringing, possibly with family conflicts or other stressors that could have impacted his development and potentially led him down a path of criminal behavior.\n\nLastly, he considers God to have something to do with what happens to him personally. This is more about his beliefs and may not directly relate to risk assessment unless there's a belief in divine intervention affecting personal outcomes in ways that could influence his decision-making or perception of justice.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Multiple arrests and convictions are significant risk factors.\n\n- Unemployment, possibly due to educational gaps or mental health issues, can lead to desperation.\n\n- Past month feelings of despair suggest potential mental health struggles.\n\n- Difficult upbringing may have contributed to current behavioral patterns.\n\nGiven these points, the overall picture suggests that this individual is at high risk for future criminal behavior. The combination of multiple legal infractions, unemployment due to educational limitations and possibly mental health issues, and a history of hardship could predispose him towards involvement in crime.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is YES, these risk factors indicate high risk.\n\nAs for confidence, considering the weight of these factors together, I'd rate my confidence at 90%.\n\nSo, the JSON object would be:\n\n{\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 90\n\n}",
