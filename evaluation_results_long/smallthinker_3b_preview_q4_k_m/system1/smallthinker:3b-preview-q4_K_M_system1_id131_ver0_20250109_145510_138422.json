    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high-risk profile for a person who has been arrested multiple times and is currently under judicial scrutiny. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 20 (young adult)\n- Race/ethnicity: Black\n- Physical attributes: Height and weight do not stand out as significant risk factors.\n- Living situation: Currently living alone after never being married. This could be a sign of instability or lack of social support.\n\nNext, let's look at the criminal history:\n- Arrested 3 times and convicted. These are clear indicators of past misconduct, which can suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues.\n- No high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college. This could indicate lower educational attainment and potentially limited job prospects.\n\nNow, let's examine the employment history:\n- Never held jobs during the year. This is a significant factor as it suggests a lack of stable employment, which can be a risk indicator for future criminal behavior.\n- No mention of any form of education or training programs in recent years.\n\nMoving on to substance use:\n- Used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. This could indicate a history of substance abuse, which is often linked with increased risk-taking behaviors.\n- Not felt depressed over the past month. This seems contradictory to the previous point; typically, depression can be a factor in criminal behavior.\n\nLet's consider social background:\n- Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4, urban area. The living situation and environment could play a role in shaping behavior, but it is not directly tied to criminal activity.\n- Belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This belief system might influence his actions, potentially leading to a more law-abiding stance.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. While some of these factors suggest instability and past misconduct, the overall pattern does not clearly indicate a high-risk profile for serious criminal behavior. The lack of recent jobs, lower educational attainment, and history of substance use are concerning, but the belief in divine intervention might mitigate some risk-taking behaviors.\n\nWait, let me break this down further - the key here is to balance the indicators of past misconduct with the potential mitigating factors such as religious beliefs or stability issues. Given that he has never been married and lives alone, there might be an underlying instability or lack of social support that could contribute to future criminal behavior.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that while some risk factors are present, they do not strongly indicate a high-risk profile for serious criminal behavior.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
