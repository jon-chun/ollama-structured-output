    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they indicate high risk for this individual. I'll break down the analysis step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor indicating potential recidivism. Let me think about this further - repeated arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of illegal behavior that may not be changing anytime soon.\n\nNext, his age and physical characteristics are relatively typical for someone in their early twenties. There's no indication here that his body type or height would pose any unusual risks, so I'll move on to other factors.\n\nNow, let me check the socio-economic background. The individual has never been married, is living alone, and does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate. These factors suggest limited education and possibly financial instability, which could impact future behavior. Wait, let me think about this more - while these factors are concerning, they don't necessarily mean he's at high risk of criminal activity.\n\nMoving on to his employment history. The person has held two jobs in a year. While having multiple jobs can be seen as a positive indicator of employability and stability, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. So, I'll consider this factor less critical for the current risk assessment.\n\nThe substance use factor is significant. He has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Additionally, there's mention of feeling so down that nothing could cheer him up during some periods. This suggests a possible pattern of substance abuse and emotional distress, which are both red flags for potential criminal behavior.\n\nLastly, his early life experiences and belief in God need to be considered. Living with his biological mother in a household of size 4 is common, but the individual's belief in God might indicate some form of coping mechanism or support system. However, this factor doesn't directly correlate with increased risk of criminal activity.\n\nLet me summarize my findings: The repeated arrests and convictions are alarming. Substance abuse history and emotional distress also increase the risk profile. While socio-economic factors are present, they don't necessarily lead to high-risk behavior.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe that the presence of these risk factors indicates a high risk for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
