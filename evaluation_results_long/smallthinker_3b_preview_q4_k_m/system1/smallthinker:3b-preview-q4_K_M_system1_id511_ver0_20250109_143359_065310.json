    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step and think through them one by one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 19 years old\n- Race: Black\n- Height and weight: 6 feet 0 inches, 165 lbs\n\nThese factors alone do not typically correlate with high-risk behavior. However, they are part of a broader picture that we need to construct.\n\nNext, let's look at the criminal history:\n- Arrested once\n- Convicted\n\nThis is a clear indicator of past involvement in the legal system. While this alone does not necessarily mean someone is dangerous, it does suggest a certain level of risk.\n\nNow, let's consider the personal life factors:\n- Never been married\n- Currently living alone\n- High school diploma\n- Enrolled in 4-year college\n- Held 3 jobs during the year\n\nThese factors suggest a stable and somewhat privileged upbringing, with education being a priority. However, they do not directly indicate high-risk behavior.\n\nLet's examine the substance use factor:\n- Used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years\n- Felt so down that nothing could cheer him up for some time during the past month\n\nThis is a significant red flag. Drug use and signs of severe emotional distress can indicate unstable mental health or potential self-harm.\n\nNow, let's look at the family background:\n- Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 3\n- Believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally\n\nThis suggests a strong sense of faith and possibly a supportive family environment. However, it does not directly correlate with high-risk behavior.\n\nFinally, let's consider the overall picture:\n- Youthful arrest\n- Conviction history\n- Substance use\n- Emotional distress signs\n- Faith-based beliefs\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can see that while there are some mitigating factors (such as education and a belief in God), the combination of criminal history, substance use, and emotional distress raises significant concerns about potential high-risk behavior.\n\nLet me check my notes again to ensure I haven't missed anything. Yes, all these factors collectively point towards a profile that may indicate high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
