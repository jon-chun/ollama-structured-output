    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the individual's background. The person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. This information alone doesn't seem to point towards any significant risk factors. Wait, let me check if there are any specific aspects of his identity that could be relevant... Ah, yes, being White might not necessarily indicate any bias or predisposition in this context.\n\nNext, I'll examine the arrest and conviction record. The person has been arrested 1 time and convicted. This is a significant factor, but let me think about how to interpret it within the broader context of risk assessment. It suggests that there have been instances where legal issues have arisen, which could potentially be related to substance use or other behaviors... But I need more information to fully understand the implications.\n\nMoving on, his physical characteristics and living situation seem relatively neutral at first glance. He's 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs, with no specific health issues mentioned. The fact that he's never been married and is currently living alone doesn't immediately raise any red flags. Let me consider this further... Perhaps there are aspects of his lifestyle or personal circumstances that could be linked to higher risk factors.\n\nHis educational background is also noteworthy. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, indicating some level of education and possibly self-improvement efforts. This suggests he's not without some form of responsibility or ambition. Wait, let me think about how this might intersect with other factors... It seems that while his educational pursuits are positive, they don't directly point to any significant risk behaviors.\n\nRegarding substance use, the person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This is a critical factor to consider, as drug use can be indicative of underlying issues such as addiction or mental health problems. Let me reflect on this for a moment... Drug use over an extended period could potentially indicate a higher risk profile, but I need to balance this with other factors.\n\nAdditionally, the person has not felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive aspect. However, let me think about how this might relate to his overall risk assessment... The absence of depression doesn't negate the possibility of underlying issues that could manifest in different ways.\n\nConsidering his living situation and family background, the fact that he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area at a young age, provides some insight into his past environment. This could potentially influence his risk factors... But I need to approach this thoughtfully, recognizing that such details can be complex and multifaceted.\n\nLastly, the person's belief in God and its relevance to their personal experiences is an interesting aspect. Let me ponder on how faith might intersect with these risk factors... While it's a personal and potentially significant aspect of their worldview, it doesn't directly indicate any higher risk behaviors or predispositions without further context.\n\nAfter carefully weighing all these factors, I'm starting to form an opinion about the overall risk level. It seems that while there are some concerning aspects, such as his arrest record and substance use history, certain mitigating factors also come into play... Let me summarize my thoughts and formulate a conclusion based on this analysis.\n\nGiven the complexity of these factors and their interplay, I'm inclined to think that the presence of significant risk factors outweighs the mitigating ones. However, let me not overlook the importance of nuanced judgment in risk assessment...\n\nUpon reflection, it appears that the combination of his arrest history, substance use, and other factors does indeed suggest a higher risk profile. Therefore, after careful consideration of all these elements, my prediction is clear.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
