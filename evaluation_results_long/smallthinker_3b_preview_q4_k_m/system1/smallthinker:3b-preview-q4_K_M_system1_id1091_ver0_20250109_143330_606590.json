    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze each risk factor and consider the overall profile of the individual in question.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the number of arrests and convictions. The fact that he's been arrested 7 times and convicted suggests a significant pattern of illegal activity. This is a strong indicator of high risk behavior. Let me check the next point - his conviction record alone should be enough to raise concerns, but considering he's been arrested multiple times, it indicates a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let me think about his physical attributes. He's 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. While these are average ranges for height and weight, they don't necessarily indicate any risk factors on their own. However, in the context of his criminal history, it might suggest a certain level of physical prowess that could be used to enforce or support illegal activities.\n\nMoving on to his personal life - he's never been married, lives alone, and has no job currently. These points don't directly indicate any high-risk behavior but do suggest a possible lack of social support and economic stability, which could influence his decisions.\n\nNext, I need to consider his educational background. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a significant gap in education, which can often correlate with lower socioeconomic status and potentially higher risk behaviors.\n\nThen, there's the issue of substance use. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and during the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. These symptoms are indicative of possible mental health issues or a history of drug abuse, which can be significant risk factors.\n\nFinally, I need to consider his early life experiences. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This background could potentially shape his worldview and behavior, but it doesn't directly indicate any high-risk activities.\n\nNow, let me summarize all these points - the pattern of arrests and convictions, the lack of education, substance use issues, and possibly troubled early life experiences all suggest a complex risk profile. Given this analysis, I can confidently say that these factors indicate a high risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
