    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down each factor step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. The person has been arrested 17 times and convicted. This is certainly a significant indicator of past criminal behavior. However, I need to think about the context - was this person arrested and convicted for violent crimes or non-violent offenses? The frequency alone suggests a pattern of engaging in legal issues.\n\nNext, physical attributes are straightforward. An 18-year-old male who is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 155 lbs doesn't immediately suggest any risk factors beyond what one would expect from this age group.\n\nMarital status is another factor. Being single and currently living alone could indicate instability or a lack of support system, which might be relevant in certain contexts but not necessarily a strong indicator on its own.\n\nEducation level is also important. The fact that he does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college points to a lower educational attainment. This can often correlate with higher crime rates due to limited opportunities for education and training.\n\nEmployment history is another area of concern. Holding only 1 job during the year suggests unemployment, which might indicate financial instability and possibly a lack of positive role models or support systems.\n\nDrug use is a critical factor here. The person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), which indicates substance abuse. Additionally, there's a mention that he felt so down in the dumps for over 30 days straight, which suggests symptoms of depression. This combination can be particularly dangerous as it may indicate a higher risk of engaging in impulsive or violent behavior.\n\nLastly, his upbringing is an important consideration. Living with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area provides context to his social environment and potentially influences his behavior.\n\nWait a minute... Let me check the instruction again. I need to determine if these factors collectively indicate high risk. Given the combination of arrest history, drug use, unemployment, limited education, unstable living situation, and past experiences with substance abuse and depression, it seems that this person does indeed present a high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
