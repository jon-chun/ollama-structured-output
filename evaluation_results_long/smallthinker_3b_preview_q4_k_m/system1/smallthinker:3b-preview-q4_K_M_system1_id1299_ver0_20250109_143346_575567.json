    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and assess whether they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors one by one and think through their implications.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. This demographic information alone doesn't significantly impact the risk assessment without additional context or patterns of behavior. So, I'll keep this in mind but not assign a high risk score to it yet.\n\nNext, she has been arrested three times and has been convicted. This is a significant factor. Let me think about this for a moment... The fact that she's been arrested multiple times and convicted suggests a pattern of non-compliance with the law. However, without knowing the nature of these crimes or her circumstances at the time, it's challenging to gauge the full extent of her risk.\n\nShe is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 130 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight don't typically influence risk assessment unless there are specific medical conditions or behaviors associated with them. So, I'll not assign a high risk score here either.\n\nCurrently living alone without being married, this factor also doesn't directly impact the risk assessment. It's more about personal circumstances that don't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. This aligns somewhat with the previous point but still doesn't suggest a high-risk profile.\n\nShe does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lack of formal education, which can be a risk factor in itself due to limited employment opportunities and potential involvement in criminal activities as a means of financial support. However, the number of years she has been living alone without a higher education doesn't necessarily correlate with high-risk behavior.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year. Employment history is important but not solely determinative of risk level. She uses drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. The use of marijuana, while illegal, does not necessarily indicate a high risk for violent or serious criminal behavior. However, it's an important factor to consider.\n\nShe has a history of living with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area at a young age. This suggests that she may have grown up in a challenging environment, which could potentially impact her development and interactions with the law. However, without more context on how this situation affected her, it's difficult to assign a high risk score.\n\nLastly, she considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This is a personal belief but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are specific beliefs or motivations tied to religious practices or teachings that could influence risky behaviors.\n\nLet me check the overall pattern here... She has multiple arrests and convictions, which suggest a history of non-compliance with the law. Additionally, she has never been married, is currently living alone, lacks formal education, and has used drugs in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. These factors collectively indicate a high-risk profile.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that these risk factors suggest a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
