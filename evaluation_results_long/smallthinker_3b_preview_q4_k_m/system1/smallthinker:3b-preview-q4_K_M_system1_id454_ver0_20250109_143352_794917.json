    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high-risk individual. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the list of risk factors: \n- The person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White.\n- She has been arrested twice and has been convicted.\n- Her physical characteristics are 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 130 lbs.\n- She has never been married and lives alone, currently.\n- Education-wise, she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college.\n- Employment: she's held only one job during the year.\n- Substance use: she has used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years.\n- Mental health: she hasn't felt depressed over the past month.\n- Family history: at a young age, she lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.\n- Belief system: she considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nWait, let me break this down. The combination of being arrested twice, having a conviction, and using drugs despite not feeling depressed over the past month seems like significant red flags. Additionally, living with non-biological parents in an urban area could indicate a history of instability or neglect.\n\nLet me think about the confidence level. Given these factors, I'm leaning towards a high risk. But how confident am I? Considering the severity and combination of these risk factors, my confidence is moderate to high, but let's quantify it to be precise.\n\nNow, I need to assign a confidence score between 0 and 100. This requires weighing each factor against its potential impact on the individual's behavior or likelihood of future negative actions. \n\nAfter careful consideration:\n- Arrests and convictions significantly increase risk.\n- Substance use, even with moderate depression, indicates potential for risky behaviors.\n- The living situation, while not directly related to substance use, suggests instability.\n- Belief in God might indicate a stronger sense of morality but does not negate the other factors.\n\nGiven these thoughts, I conclude that yes, this individual indicates high risk. My confidence level is 85 out of 100, reflecting my assessment after weighing all factors carefully.\n\nTherefore, my answer is:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
