    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider her criminal history - she has been arrested 3 times and convicted. This is a significant factor, as repeated convictions can suggest a pattern of behavior that may be indicative of higher risk. Wait, let me check the specifics... Yes, her conviction history alone might lead me to think this could be high risk.\n\nHowever, there are other factors at play here. She has never been married and lives alone, which might suggest she is more isolated and potentially more vulnerable to certain behaviors or pressures. Let me consider how this isolation could impact her decision-making... It's possible that living alone could lead to a greater sense of responsibility, but it also means there may be fewer external influences shaping her actions.\n\nHer educational background is another critical factor - lacking a high school diploma or GED certificate and not being enrolled in college. This lack of formal education can affect one's ability to secure stable employment, which might impact their future behavior. Let me think about how this could influence her risk profile... Without a strong foundation in education and possibly a sense of purpose through higher learning, she might be more inclined towards certain activities or decisions that could increase her risk.\n\nAdditionally, her employment history is quite limited - only holding one job during the year. This suggests a lack of stability and a potential difficulty in finding secure employment, which could contribute to feelings of dissatisfaction or desperation. Wait a minute... Could this lack of stability be linked to her recent use of drugs? It's possible that she might turn to substances as a coping mechanism for these feelings.\n\nHer substance use is also a significant risk factor - using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with all of the time during the past month feeling so down that nothing could cheer her up. This pattern of drug use, combined with her recent psychological state, indicates a potential high risk situation. Let me consider the implications... The combination of substance abuse and severe depression or despair could suggest she is at higher risk for engaging in behaviors that put herself or others at risk.\n\nFurthermore, her background includes living with her biological dad in a household of size 4 at a young age. This could influence her sense of family and possibly shape how she perceives authority figures or societal expectations. Let me think about this... Growing up in such a large household might have provided her with different life experiences and values compared to those who grew up alone, which could affect her risk profile.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally is an interesting aspect. This perspective on the role of religion or divine intervention in one's life could potentially influence her decision-making process, especially when faced with challenges or crises. Wait, let me consider this further... If she believes that external forces are not guiding her actions, it might mean she relies more on personal choices and instincts, which could sometimes lead to higher-risk behaviors.\n\nGiven all these factors - repeated convictions, substance abuse, limited employment history, recent psychological distress, and a specific belief about the role of God in life - I believe this individual may be at high risk. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of her criminal history, substance use, lack of education, isolation, and personal beliefs suggests a complex set of circumstances that could lead to higher-risk behavior.\n\nTherefore, after careful consideration, I conclude that yes, these risk factors indicate high risk for this individual. My confidence in this prediction is based on the thorough analysis of each factor and how they collectively contribute to a higher likelihood of risky behavior or outcomes.\n\nHere is my final answer in the required format:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
