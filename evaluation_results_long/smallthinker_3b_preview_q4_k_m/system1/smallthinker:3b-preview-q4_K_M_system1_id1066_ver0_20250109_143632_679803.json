    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high-risk profile for an individual. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider the individual's criminal history. He has been arrested 3 times and convicted, which is a significant factor in assessing his risk level. Wait, let me check the other details... Yes, he also has a conviction record, which further supports the idea that he may be at high risk.\n\nNext, I'll examine his personal background. He's an 18-year-old male, identifies as Black, and is currently living alone without any family support. Let me think about this for a moment... Living alone with no family support could indicate a lack of social connections and potential isolation, which might be a risk factor.\n\nNow, considering his education and employment status... He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and has never been married. Additionally, he hasn't held any jobs during the year. This combination suggests a limited educational background and a lack of stable employment, which could contribute to his risk level.\n\nLet me also consider his substance use history. He's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. However, it's mentioned that he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Wait a minute... The frequency and type of drug use are significant factors, but the lack of recent depression could mitigate some of this risk.\n\nAnother crucial aspect is his early life experiences. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area at a young age. Let me think about how this might influence his current behavior... Growing up in such circumstances could have had an impact on his development, possibly influencing his decision-making and risk-taking behaviors.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is also noteworthy. This perspective might indicate a lack of moral compass or values, which could be a significant factor in assessing his risk level.\n\nGiven all these factors... Let me summarize my thoughts. The combination of his criminal history, substance use, and personal background strongly suggests that he may be at high risk. However, the fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently and holds a particular view about God might reduce some of this risk.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe it's reasonable to conclude that these risk factors do indicate a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
