    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's background and personal life. They are a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White, which doesn't seem particularly relevant to their risk level in this context. Wait, let me check... No, it seems that their age, gender, and ethnicity don't directly impact their risk score.\n\nNext, I'll examine the arrest and conviction history. They have been arrested 1 time and have been convicted. This is a significant factor - convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior or a tendency to engage in criminal activity. Let me think about this... Yes, a single conviction could potentially suggest some level of risk, but it's essential to consider other factors as well.\n\nNow, let's look at their physical characteristics and living situation. They are 5 feet 2 inches tall and weigh 120 lbs, which doesn't seem particularly relevant to their risk level either. And they have never been married, are currently not living alone, and don't have a high school diploma - these factors might indicate some stability or independence in their life, but I need to consider them more carefully.\n\nTheir educational background is also an important factor. They have a high school diploma and are enrolled in a 2-year college, which suggests that they are actively engaged in learning and personal development. This could potentially mitigate some risk factors. Let me think about this... Yes, education can be a strong indicator of future success or stability.\n\nIn terms of employment history, they have held only 1 job during the year, which is relatively limited. However, I need to consider the context - they might not be seeking multiple jobs, and their job experience could be relevant in specific situations.\n\nTheir substance abuse and mental health status are also crucial factors. They have not used any drugs in the past four years and have not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that they may not currently be at risk for substance abuse or depression-related problems.\n\nFinally, I should consider their family background. They lived with their biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area - this could indicate some level of dependence on family members or a history of living conditions that might have affected them. Wait a minute... This factor is quite important, as it suggests potential exposure to various influences and experiences.\n\nAnd then there's the statement about God: they consider that God has nothing to do with what happens to them personally. Let me think about this... While personal beliefs may not directly impact risk assessment in legal contexts, they could potentially influence how the person perceives or responds to certain situations.\n\nNow, let me summarize my thoughts and calculate a risk score. Given all these factors - arrest and conviction history, employment stability, educational attainment, substance abuse status, mental health status, family background, and personal beliefs - I would say that there is some level of risk associated with this individual. However, the question asks for a yes or no answer regarding high risk prediction.\n\nAfter careful consideration, my initial inclination is to lean towards \"NO\" as the prediction, given the presence of several risk factors but also mitigating circumstances such as education and stable employment. But let me reconsider... The combination of convictions, limited employment history, and potential family influences does suggest a higher level of risk than what might be considered low.\n\nUpon further reflection, I realize that while no single factor indicates extremely high risk, the accumulation of several factors - arrest and conviction, limited job experience, unstable living situation, and certain family dynamics - collectively raises concerns about their propensity for future criminal behavior or problematic life situations. Therefore, my final prediction would be \"YES,\" indicating a high risk prediction.\n\nMy confidence in this assessment is moderate to high, given the detailed analysis of the factors involved. However, I must emphasize that risk assessments are complex and often subjective, requiring careful consideration of multiple variables against established criteria for each factor.\n\nHere is my refined answer in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
