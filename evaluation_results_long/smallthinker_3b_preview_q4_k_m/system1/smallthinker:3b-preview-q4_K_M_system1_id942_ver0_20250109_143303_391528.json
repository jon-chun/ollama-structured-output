    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task here to analyze these risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Okay, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, the individual is a 20-year-old male, White ethnicity. Age 20 might be considered young, but in terms of criminal activity, it could go either way depending on his past behavior and potential for future offenses.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That's important because arrests don't always lead to convictions, and being acquitted or having charges dropped can suggest that he might not be a high risk offender. However, the fact that he's been arrested at all raises some red flags.\n\nHeight is 5'9\" and weight is 155 lbs. Not sure how these physical attributes directly relate to criminal behavior, but maybe in certain contexts, like if he's involved in physical altercations or has a build that makes him more likely to engage in such acts. But generally, height and weight aren't strong indicators of criminal propensity.\n\nLiving alone currently, no spouse or dependents. That might suggest some level of independence, which could be positive or negative depending on the context. Maybe living alone increases one's ability to commit certain crimes without supervision.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not enrolled in college. That suggests he may have limited formal education and possibly different life opportunities ahead of him. Could this lead to involvement in crime if other paths seem unclear? Maybe, but it's not directly indicative of risk.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment stability could be a factor; someone who is employed might be less likely to engage in criminal activities that could jeopardize their livelihood. On the other hand, holding only two jobs might suggest limited job security or perhaps he's having difficulty finding steady employment, which could indicate some instability.\n\nDrug use: used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). That does raise concerns about substance abuse history. Recidivism is often higher for individuals with a history of drug-related offenses. So, this factor points towards high risk.\n\nNo depression over the past month. That's positive; no signs of mental health issues that might predispose him to criminal behavior.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. Living with family members could have different implications for behavior compared to living alone or with non-family members. Maybe he's received support from his family, which could mitigate risky behaviors. Or perhaps there are familial pressures that influence his actions.\n\nLastly, he considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This seems like a strong belief in spirituality and possibly having moral values based on religious teachings. That might suggest he adheres to certain ethical standards and is less likely to engage in serious criminal activities. However, it's hard to quantify this factor in terms of risk assessment.\n\nOkay, now let's try to synthesize all these factors.\n\nHe has a history of drug use, which is a significant red flag for criminal activity related to substance abuse. The fact that he's been arrested once but not convicted might indicate that he gets lucky or finds legal representation that helps him avoid serious charges. However, the arrest itself suggests at least some level of involvement in criminal behavior.\n\nHis age and education level could play into his opportunities and access to resources. At 20, he may have years to go before reaching adulthood in terms of voting or serving on a jury, but perhaps being considered an adult already with these other factors is relevant.\n\nLiving alone might make him less supervised and thus potentially more vulnerable to peer pressure from those around him. But since he's currently living alone, maybe his peers are not as influential right now.\n\nThe belief in God suggesting moral values could be protective against certain types of criminal behavior, but it's hard to measure that quantitatively.\n\nOverall, the combination of drug use history and a past arrest is concerning. The fact that he hasn't been convicted yet might suggest that he's lucky or that his defense was strong. However, given that he has used drugs in the past four years, which could be seen as a pattern leading up to this point, it points towards higher risk.\n\nI'm going to lean towards predicting high risk based on these factors. But I need to decide on a confidence level.\n\nLet me think about the scale: 0-100%. Given that he has drug use history and a past arrest, but hasn't been convicted yet, maybe a lower confidence level is appropriate. Perhaps around 70% confident in predicting high risk.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that his not being convicted might suggest that he's managed to navigate legal issues without serious charges, maybe a slightly higher confidence level?\n\nHmm. Maybe 80%.\n\nWait, but the drug use history is pretty significant. That's definitely a major risk factor.\n\nAlso, considering his age and education level, perhaps there are more opportunities for him to get into trouble if he doesn't stay on track.\n\nMaybe I should go with 85% confidence in predicting high risk.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\n- Arrested once, not convicted: mixed signals\n\n- Drug use history: significant risk factor\n\n- Age and education level: potentially vulnerable\n\n- Living alone: possibly more susceptible to peer pressure\n\n- Belief in God: suggests adherence to moral values, protective against certain crimes\n\nOverall, the drug use history is a strong indicator. The arrest could be seen as a warning sign.\n\nSo, I'll stick with 85% confidence in predicting high risk.\n\nNow, to format this into JSON:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\nWait, but the instruction was to only include the prediction and confidence level, no additional text. So that should be fine.\n\nYes, that seems appropriate.\n\n**Final Response**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\n",
