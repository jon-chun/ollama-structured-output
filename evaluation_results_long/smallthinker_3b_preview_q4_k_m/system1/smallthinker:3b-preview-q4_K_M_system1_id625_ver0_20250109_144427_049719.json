    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual described. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and race. At 19 years old, he is still in his teenage years, which might suggest impulsivity or vulnerability to peer pressure. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate a high risk unless other factors are present. So, I'll keep this in mind but move on.\n\nNext, the fact that he has been arrested once but not convicted. This could be a red flag, as it suggests some level of involvement with the law or potentially risky behavior. However, without knowing the circumstances or if there were mitigating factors, this factor alone doesn't suggest high risk. I'll need to weigh this against other factors.\n\nHis physical attributes are quite distinct: 6 feet 5 inches and weighing 220 lbs. These details don't directly relate to risk assessment unless they imply a propensity for violence or some form of aggression. Given the information provided, this doesn't suggest high risk. So, I'll set these aside for now.\n\nLiving alone is a significant factor. It might indicate a lack of social support or potential isolation, which could be correlated with higher risk behaviors. However, without more context on how he handles his living situation, it's hard to make a definitive judgment.\n\nHis educational status shows that he is currently enrolled in school. This suggests stability and perhaps a commitment to personal growth, which are generally positive indicators. So, this factor seems to lean against high risk.\n\nJob history indicates he has held only one job during the past year. While this could suggest instability or lack of ambition, it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless there's evidence of problematic behavior. So, I'll keep this in mind but move on.\n\nHis substance use is clean, and he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These factors are positive indicators of a relatively stable mental health state and avoidance of harmful substances, which are strong negatives for high-risk profiles.\n\nThe significant factor regarding his upbringing is that he lived with his biological father in a household of size 3 at an early age. This could suggest exposure to certain values or potential influences on behavior, but it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk without more context.\n\nLastly, his belief in God and its relevance to his personal experiences might be a factor for some, but it's generally considered a positive attribute unless it leads to harmful actions. So, I'll set this aside for now.\n\nLet me summarize the key points:\n- Arrested once, not convicted.\n- Physical attributes: height and weight.\n- Living alone.\n- Currently enrolled in school.\n- One job in the past year.\n- No substance use or depression over the past month.\n- Raised with a biological father in a household of size 3.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I realize that while some factors suggest potential instability or lack of social support, the overall picture paints a more nuanced profile. The absence of direct indicators of high-risk behavior and the presence of positive factors such as education and stability weigh against a high-risk assessment.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
