    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk for a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key details: she has been arrested once but not convicted, which is an important factor. Wait, let me consider what that really means - being arrested doesn't necessarily mean she will engage in criminal behavior again. However, it does suggest a pattern of potential law-breaking. Let me check if there are any other factors that might influence my assessment.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 190 lbs, but physical attributes don't typically indicate risk level on their own. Nevertheless, they could be relevant in certain contexts or when considering how she interacts with the criminal justice system. Let me set those aside for now and focus on her background and current situation.\n\nShe's a high school diploma holder enrolled in a 2-year college, which indicates some educational attainment. That's a positive factor - it suggests she has potential for future academic achievement and possibly better employment opportunities if she manages to avoid further legal issues. She's currently living alone, without any immediate family support, but that might also indicate independence or a lack of social safety nets. Let me think about how these factors might interact.\n\nThe fact that she hasn't used drugs in the past four years is significant - it suggests she doesn't currently engage in substance use, which could be a risk factor for other behaviors. Similarly, her lack of depression over the past month indicates relatively good mental health status. These are both positive signs but should still be considered within the context of all available information.\n\nHer living situation as a young adult alone could also play into potential risks related to social isolation or vulnerability to certain types of exploitation. However, it's crucial to remember that many individuals thrive alone navigate their lives successfully without incident. Let me consider how this factor might weigh in my assessment.\n\nThe mention of God potentially having something to do with what happens to her personally is a personal belief and doesn't necessarily indicate any specific risk factors related to criminal behavior or law breaking. It's more about her worldview and relationship with the divine, which generally doesn't influence one's likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. Wait a minute - I need to be careful not to make assumptions here.\n\nGiven all these factors, let me summarize my thoughts: she has a history that includes arrest but no conviction, some educational attainment, independence in her living situation, and generally good mental health. While none of these individually scream \"high risk,\" the combination of elements does suggest a moderate level of caution is warranted. Let me think about how to quantify this.\n\nConsidering all the factors together, I'm going to predict that yes, there are high risk indicators here. However, my confidence in this prediction isn't extremely high because while some factors point towards potential risks, others indicate responsible behavior and resilience. Therefore, my confidence level is moderate but leaning slightly towards recognizing the need for caution.\n\nHere's my assessment as a JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
