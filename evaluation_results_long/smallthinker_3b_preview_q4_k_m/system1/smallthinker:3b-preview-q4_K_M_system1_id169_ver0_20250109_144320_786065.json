    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll examine the person's background. They are a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. This information alone doesn't seem alarming, but let me consider it in context. Wait, what else do we know? Ah yes, he has been arrested three times and has been convicted. That's a significant red flag - multiple arrests and convictions can indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\nLet me check the specifics of his background again. He is 6 feet 0 inches tall and weighs 210 lbs, which might not be directly relevant to risk assessment but could be useful for other considerations. Now, regarding his personal life: he has never been married, lives alone, holds a high school diploma, isn't enrolled in college, and has held two jobs during the year. These factors suggest a certain level of independence and perhaps financial stability.\n\nNow, let's dive deeper into the risk factors. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which is a concern as drug use can sometimes be linked to other risky behaviors or mental health issues. However, it's also important to note that not feeling depressed over the past month might indicate that he's currently in a relatively stable emotional state.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This information could be relevant for understanding potential family dynamics or socioeconomic factors that influence behavior. And then there's this unique belief: \"God has something to do with what happens to me personally.\" While I understand the importance of faith and spirituality in many people's lives, it's unclear how this belief directly impacts risk assessment without further context.\n\nGiven all these factors, let me think about how they collectively paint a picture of potential risk. Multiple arrests and convictions are certainly concerning. The drug use history, combined with his lack of depression over the past month, might suggest that he has been able to manage any psychological issues in a way that hasn't led to significant emotional distress recently.\n\nWait a minute... Considering all these points together, it seems there's a mix of potentially risky behaviors and life circumstances. However, without more direct indicators like mental health issues or violent offenses, the risk profile appears somewhat nuanced.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm inclined to think that while this person does exhibit some risk factors, they might not necessarily indicate high risk on their own. The combination of factors seems to point towards a moderate level of risk rather than high risk. Let me check my reasoning once more to ensure I've considered all aspects.\n\nUpon reflection, it's clear that no single factor alone justifies labeling this individual as high risk. Instead, the pattern and combination of these factors suggest a complex situation that requires careful evaluation beyond just categorizing them as high or low risk.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, my conclusion is that while there are risk factors present, they do not collectively indicate high risk. \n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
