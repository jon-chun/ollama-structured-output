    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me walk through the process step by step, reflecting on each decision and thought along the way.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors for this particular case. Let's start with the arrest record:\n\n- Factor: Number of Arrests (past year)\n  - Weight: high (3)\n  - Reasoning: The person has been arrested once in the past year. This is a significant factor as it indicates a history of law-breaking.\n  \nNext, let me consider drug use patterns:\n\n- Factor: Drug Use (past four years)\n  - Weight: medium (2)\n  - Reasoning: The individual has used drugs in the past four years. This suggests a potential for continued substance abuse and possibly criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's think about mental health status:\n\n- Factor: Mental Health Status\n  - Weight: low (1)\n  - Reasoning: The person does not mention any mental health issues. This factor is less relevant to recidivism in this context.\n\nMoving on to employment history:\n\n- Factor: Employment History (past year)\n  - Weight: medium (2)\n  - Reasoning: The individual has held four jobs in the past year. This could indicate a lack of stable employment, which might suggest financial instability and potential for criminal activity.\n\nNext, let's consider living situation:\n\n- Factor: Living Situation\n  - Weight: low (1)\n  - Reasoning: The person lives alone, but this factor is less relevant to recidivism in this context.\n\nFinally, let me think about the personal beliefs regarding God:\n\n- Factor: Personal Beliefs Regarding God\n  - Weight: medium (2)\n  - Reasoning: The individual considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This could indicate a strong sense of moral guidance or potential for external influences affecting her behavior.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights [low, medium, high] to each risk factor:\n\n- Factor1: Number of Arrests (past year) -> high\n- Factor2: Drug Use (past four years) -> medium\n- Factor3: Mental Health Status -> low\n- Factor4: Employment History (past year) -> medium\n- Factor5: Living Situation -> low\n- Factor6: Personal Beliefs Regarding God -> medium\n\nWith these weights in mind, let's predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests (past year)\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested once in the past year.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (past four years)\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used drugs in the past four years.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"The person does not mention any mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment History (past year)\", \"medium\", \"The individual has held four jobs in the past year.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"The person lives alone, but this factor is less relevant to recidivism in this context.\"),\n    (\"Personal Beliefs Regarding God\", \"medium\", \"The individual considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
