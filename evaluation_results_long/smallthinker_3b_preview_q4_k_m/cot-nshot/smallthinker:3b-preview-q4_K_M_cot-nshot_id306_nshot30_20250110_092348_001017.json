    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me first carefully analyze the given risk factors and their relative weights before making a prediction. I'll break down each factor step-by-step to ensure clarity and thoroughness.\n\nLet's start with the age of the individual. The case involves a 19-year-old female. This is relatively young, but not extremely young. Age alone doesn't seem like a significant risk factor in this context. So, I would assign it a low weight.\n\nNext, the conviction history shows that she has been arrested once but not convicted. This indicates a limited criminal history, which is positive. Therefore, I'll also assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nThe number of jobs held by the individual is one job during the year. This seems like a stable situation, so again, I'll assign a low weight.\n\nLiving with both biological parents and considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally are factors in their own right. The living situation might influence social support, but it's not directly related to criminal behavior. So, I'll also assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nThe past four years of drug use is a significant factor. Given the context of the case and the limited information provided, I would assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nLastly, the living situation at a young age with both biological parents could influence social support and family dynamics. This might be considered moderately important, so I'll assign a medium weight to this factor as well.\n\nNow, let's combine these weights and make a prediction based on the collective risk factors.\n\nWait a minute... let me double-check my reasoning here. The key here is to ensure that the collective risk factors are appropriately weighted and that the prediction reflects a balanced view of the individual's situation.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"relatively young but not extremely\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"low\", \"limited criminal history\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"low\", \"stable situation\"),\n    (\"living_with_parents\", \"medium\", \"influences social support and family dynamics\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"medium\", \"significant factor in risk assessment\"),\n    (\"family_influence_youth\", \"medium\", \"may impact social support and behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
