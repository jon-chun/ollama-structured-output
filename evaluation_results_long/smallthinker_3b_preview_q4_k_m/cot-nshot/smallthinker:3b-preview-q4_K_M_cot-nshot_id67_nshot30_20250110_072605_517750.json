    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign weights to each risk factor before making a prediction. Let me break down the process step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the risk factors from the previous examples that might be relevant for our case:\n\n- Arrest history (number of arrests in the past 2 years)\n- Conviction history\n- Age at first arrest\n- Family background and stability\n- Substance abuse history\n- Mental health issues\n- Community engagement and involvement\n- Education level and employment status\n\nNow, let's think about how these factors might apply to our case:\n\n1. Arrest history: The person has been arrested 3 times in the past 2 years.\n   - Low to Medium weight: Given that it's recent and multiple arrests, this is a significant factor.\n\n2. Conviction history:\n   - High weight: Multiple convictions, especially for a male who is 22 years old, strongly suggests a higher risk of rearrest.\n\n3. Age at first arrest:\n   - Low weight: Since the person has only been arrested 3 times recently, and the age range is not particularly significant in this context.\n\n4. Family background and stability:\n   - Medium weight: The fact that the person lived with their biological mother in a rural area might indicate some level of family instability.\n\n5. Substance abuse history:\n   - Low weight: The person has only used marijuana in the past 4 years, which is not a significant factor for rearrest risk.\n\n6. Mental health issues:\n   - Medium weight: There's no information about mental health issues, but given that they are not mentioned, this might be low.\n\n7. Community engagement and involvement:\n   - Low weight: The person has held only 1 job during the year, indicating limited community engagement.\n\n8. Education level and employment status:\n   - Medium weight: Having a high school diploma but no college enrollment suggests some educational attainment but also limited economic stability.\n\nNow that we've assigned weights to each factor, let's think about how they collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- High-weight factors (conviction history and age at first arrest) suggest a higher risk.\n- Medium-weight factors (family background, community engagement, and education status) also indicate some level of risk but not as high.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would assign:\n- Arrest history: High\n- Conviction history: High\n- Age at first arrest: Low\n- Family background and stability: Medium\n- Substance abuse history: Low\n- Mental health issues: Medium\n- Community engagement and involvement: Low\n- Education level and employment status: Medium\n\nNow, let's make a prediction based on these weights:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests in the past 2 years\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions, especially for a male who is 22 years old\"),\n    (\"age_at_first_arrest\", \"low\", \"Not particularly significant given recent arrests\"),\n    (\"family_background_and_stability\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in rural area\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"low\", \"Only used marijuana in the past 4 years\"),\n    (\"mental_health_issues\", \"medium\", \"No information provided, but not likely to be a significant factor\"),\n    (\"community_engagement_and_involvement\", \"low\", \"Limited job experience during the year\"),\n    (\"education_level_and_employment_status\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma, no college enrollment\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
