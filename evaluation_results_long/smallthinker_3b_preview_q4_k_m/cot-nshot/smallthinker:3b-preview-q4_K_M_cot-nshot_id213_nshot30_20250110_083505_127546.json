    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the given individual and assign a weight to it. Let's start with the first risk factor: having been arrested 2 times but not convicted.\n\nLet me think about this... Arrests can be a strong indicator of future criminal behavior, but convictions are more definitive. Since this person has only had arrests and no convictions, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor. This is because while it's concerning, the lack of conviction suggests that the individual might still be learning from their actions.\n\nNext, let me consider the second risk factor: not having a high school diploma or GED certificate. Wait a minute... Lack of education can indeed impact an individual's ability to find stable employment and make better life choices. This is a significant concern, so I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's move on to the third risk factor: holding no jobs during the year. Unemployment can be linked to higher crime rates, as individuals without steady employment might feel more inclined towards criminal activities. This factor also warrants a high weight.\n\nThe fourth risk factor is being 22 years old. Let me check... Age can play a role in recidivism, but it's not as critical as some of the other factors mentioned above. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nFinally, let's consider the fifth risk factor: living with his biological dad in a household of size 2. Growing up in a small family might have an impact on behavior, but it's more nuanced and not as directly linked to recidivism as some other factors. Therefore, I'll assign a low weight to this one.\n\nNow, let me think about how these risk factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Given that the individual has had arrests, lacks education, is unemployed, and comes from a small family, it seems likely that he might be at higher risk of reoffending within three years.\n\nSo, after careful consideration, I'll assign a medium confidence level to my prediction. This reflects the balance between the significant concerns raised by certain factors and the mitigating effects of others.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"arrests can be indicative but lack of convictions suggests potential for change\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"lack of formal education may impact employability and life choices\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"unemployment linked to higher crime rates, though not always directly causal\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"age is less critical than other factors in this analysis\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"small family size may have some influence but is more nuanced\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
