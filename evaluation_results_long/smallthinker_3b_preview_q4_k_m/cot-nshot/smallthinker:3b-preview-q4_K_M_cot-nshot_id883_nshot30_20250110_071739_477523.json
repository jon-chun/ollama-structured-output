    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully think through the risk factors for predicting the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. I'll break down each factor and assign a relative weight based on its impact.\n\nFirst, let's consider the age of the individual. The person is 19 years old, which means they are still in their late teens. At this age, there might be a higher likelihood of impulsivity or experimentation with crime. However, the fact that they have not been convicted of any crimes suggests some level of self-control. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNext, the arrest history. The individual has been arrested once but was not convicted. This indicates a minor offense and a lack of significant criminal record. Therefore, I'll also assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nThe conviction status is straightforward. Since there were no convictions, this factor will have a low weight.\n\nEducation level is another important factor. The individual has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. This suggests that they may be less likely to engage in serious criminal behavior due to their educational attainment. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nThe employment history indicates no jobs held during the year. Lack of work experience might suggest economic instability, which could influence criminal behavior. Thus, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nDrugs used indicate that there were no drugs used in the past four years. This is positive and suggests that substance use may not be an issue for this individual. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nThe living situation shows that they lived with their biological mother at a young age in a rural area. This might indicate different social influences compared to urban areas. Therefore, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nLastly, the belief in God indicates that the individual considers God's influence on life. This could potentially act as a deterrent to criminal behavior. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let me calculate the collective impact of these factors. Based on the weights and the textual reasoning provided in each example, I'll sum up the scores:\n\n- Age: Medium (10)\n- Arrest history: Medium (10)\n- Conviction status: Low (5)\n- Education level: Medium (10)\n- Employment history: Low (5)\n- Drugs used: Medium (10)\n- Living situation: Low (5)\n- Belief in God: Medium (10)\n\nTotal score: 45\n\nGiven the total score and the context of the examples, I'll predict a \"YES\" for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. The confidence level is set at 67% based on the analysis.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is in their late teens, which may influence impulsivity or experimentation with crime. However, no significant convictions suggest some level of self-control.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates a minor offense and lack of significant criminal record.\"),\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"low\", \"No convictions in the past four years suggest a low likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college may indicate less exposure to serious crime due to educational attainment.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"No jobs held during the year suggests economic instability, potentially influencing criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drugs_used\", \"medium\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates a positive trend and reduced likelihood of substance-related crime.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother at a young age in a rural area may indicate different social influences compared to urban areas.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Considering God's influence on life suggests potential for moral guidance and deterrence against crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 67\n}",
