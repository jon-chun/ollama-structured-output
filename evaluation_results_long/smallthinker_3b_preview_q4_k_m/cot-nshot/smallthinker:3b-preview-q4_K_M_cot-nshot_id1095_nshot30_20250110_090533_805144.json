    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the case: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. He has been arrested 4 times and convicted, which is quite severe. His height and weight are provided but won't be used in the analysis. He is currently separated and lives alone, with no jobs during the year. He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area.\n\nLet me check each risk factor one by one:\n\n1. Number of Arrests and Convictions: The person has been arrested 4 times and convicted. This is a severe offense history.\n2. Age at First Arrest: The case does not provide this information, so I'll assume it's relevant but cannot be quantified from the given data.\n3. Drug Use History: The person hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is positive.\n4. Employment Status: No jobs during the year, which indicates unemployment.\n5. Depressive Symptoms: Not felt depressed over the past month, which is positive.\n6. Socioeconomic Status: Currently separated and lives alone, suggesting lower socioeconomic status.\n7. Parental Relationships: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area, which might be relevant but cannot be quantified from the given data.\n\nNow, let me assign weights to each factor:\n\n1. Number of Arrests and Convictions: High (0.8)\n2. Age at First Arrest: Medium (0.3) - Not available, so I'll use a general average.\n3. Drug Use History: Low (0.2)\n4. Employment Status: Medium (0.6) - Unemployment might indicate higher risk.\n5. Depressive Symptoms: Low (0.1)\n6. Socioeconomic Status: High (0.9) - Currently separated and lives alone, suggesting lower socioeconomic status.\n7. Parental Relationships: Medium (0.4) - Relevant but cannot be quantified from the given data.\n\nLet me think about how these factors collectively affect the prediction. The severe offense history, unemployment, and lower socioeconomic status suggest a higher risk of recidivism. The depressive symptoms and parental relationships are relatively less impactful.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently predict that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is \"YES\".\n\nHere's the final answer in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Severe offense history\"),\n    (\"Age at First Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Not available, but assumed to be relevant\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployed during the year\"),\n    (\"Depressive Symptoms\", \"low\", \"Not depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"Socioeconomic Status\", \"high\", \"Currently separated and lives alone\"),\n    (\"Parental Relationships\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both biological parents in an urban area\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
