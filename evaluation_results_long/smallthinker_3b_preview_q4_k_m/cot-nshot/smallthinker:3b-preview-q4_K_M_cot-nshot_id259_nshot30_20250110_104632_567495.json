    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors for each individual shot example provided in the n-shot learning approach. Let me break down the process step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the risk factors that we can use to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Based on the examples provided, the relevant risk factors include:\n\n- Age\n- Race/Ethnicity\n- Education level\n- Employment status\n- Drug use history\n- Mental health issues (not explicitly mentioned but implied)\n- Family background\n\nLet me think about how to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\n\nWait, let me check the instruction again. The person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of size 3. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors contribute to the prediction. The conviction history is a significant factor, as it directly impacts the likelihood of rearrest. Education level and employment status are also important, as they can influence an individual's life trajectory and opportunities. Family background and personal beliefs about the role of God in one's life could provide context but might not be as directly relevant to recidivism.\n\nLet me assign weights to these factors:\n\n- Age: Medium (20 years old)\n- Race/Ethnicity: Low (White)\n- Education level: High (High school diploma, no college)\n- Employment status: High (No jobs during year)\n- Drug use history: Low (Not used any drugs in past four years)\n- Mental health issues: Not applicable\n- Family background: Medium (Lived with biological father, household size 3)\n- Personal beliefs about God: Not relevant to recidivism\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Given that the individual has been convicted and has a history of not using drugs, the most critical factor is likely his conviction history.\n\nWait, let me break this down further. The conviction history suggests a higher likelihood of reoffending within three years. The lack of employment and education might indicate limited opportunities for rehabilitation or recidivism prevention.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently predict that this case will have a 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome of:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma, no college\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during year\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"low\", \"Not used any drugs in past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health_issues\", \"not_applicable\", \"\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological father, household size 3\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs_about_god\", \"not_relevant\", \"\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
