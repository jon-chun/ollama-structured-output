    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the risk factors for predicting the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. I'll break down each factor and assign a relative weight before using them collectively to make my prediction.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. The person has been convicted once in the past. This is a significant factor that could influence their likelihood of being rearrested again. Let me think about this carefully - a conviction suggests a higher risk of reoffending. Therefore, I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nNext, drug use. The individual has not used any drugs in the past four years. This is a positive sign that reduces the risk of future offenses. So, I'll give it a low weight.\n\nMarital status. The person has never been married and is currently living alone. Being unmarried might be a neutral factor or slightly negative, depending on cultural norms. However, since there's no clear indication of how this affects recidivism, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nEducation level. The individual has a GED certificate but is not enrolled in college. This suggests that they have some formal education and possibly the skills to find employment, which could reduce the risk of reoffending. So, I'll give it a low weight.\n\nOccupational history. The person has held four jobs during the year. This indicates stability and adaptability in the job market, which could also reduce the risk of recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nReligious belief. The individual considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is an interesting factor that might influence behavior, but it's quite abstract and hard to quantify. So, I'll give it a low weight.\n\nNow, let me compile these factors into my prediction model:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"convicted once in the past suggests a higher risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in the past four years indicates a lower risk of future offenses\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married and living alone is neutral/maybe slightly negative\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"GED certificate, not enrolled in college suggests some formal education but possibly limited job skills\"),\n    (\"occupational_history\", \"medium\", \"held four jobs during the year indicates stability and adaptability\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"considering God's influence is abstract and hard to quantify\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
