    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the risk factors and assign weights to each one before using them to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. I'll start by breaking down the case details and thinking through each risk factor step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the arrest history. The individual has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This suggests a pattern of law-breaking, which is a significant concern. Let me think about this carefully - if someone has been arrested twice without conviction, it indicates a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior. Therefore, I would assign a weight of \"high\" to the arrest history risk factor.\n\nNext, the employment status. The individual has never been married and currently not living alone. This means she has no dependents or immediate financial support. Let me check - without financial stability, there might be an increased motivation for criminal behavior as a means of survival. I would assign a weight of \"medium\" to the employment status risk factor.\n\nThe education level is another important factor. The individual has only a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. This suggests limited opportunities and potential for further crime due to lack of skills. Let me think about this - with no higher education, there might be less motivation for law-abiding behavior. I would assign a weight of \"high\" to the education level risk factor.\n\nThe substance use history is also crucial. The individual has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. This indicates a low likelihood of future drug-related crimes or mental health issues leading to crime. Let me check - no recent substance use suggests a lower risk for future criminal behavior. I would assign a weight of \"low\" to the substance use history risk factor.\n\nLastly, the belief in God's influence on personal matters is another significant factor. The individual considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This indicates a strong sense of moral values and potential influence from religious beliefs. Let me think about this - if someone believes in God's influence, it might reduce their likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. I would assign a weight of \"low\" to the belief in God risk factor.\n\nNow, let's combine these weights and make a prediction based on the collective analysis:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice but not convicted, indicating a pattern of law-breaking.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"The individual has never been married and is currently not living alone, suggesting limited financial stability.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"The individual has only a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, indicating limited opportunities and potential for further crime due to lack of skills.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"low\", \"The individual has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month, suggesting no recent substance-related issues or mental health problems.\"),\n    (\"belief in God's influence\", \"low\", \"The individual considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally, indicating a strong sense of moral values and potential influence from religious beliefs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
