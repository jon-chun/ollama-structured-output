    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me first carefully analyze the given case study and think through the risk factors step by step.\n\nLet me check the risk factors provided for this case:\n\n- Arrested 7 times: This is a significant indicator of criminal behavior.\n- Convicted: Multiple convictions suggest a pattern of breaking laws.\n- Divorced: Financial stability might be an issue, which could influence access to resources.\n- GED certificate: Lack of formal education could affect employment prospects and life choices.\n- Held 2 jobs during the year: Limited work experience might hinder career advancement.\n- No drug use in the past four years: A positive sign regarding substance abuse issues.\n- Most of the time, felt down in the dumps without cheerfulness: Mental health concerns may be present.\n- Lived with biological mother in a household of size 3: Family support and stability are questionable.\n\nNow, let me think about how to assign weights to these factors. I'll start with the most impactful ones:\n\n1. Arrested 7 times: This factor is high because multiple arrests indicate a pattern of breaking laws.\n2. Convicted: High weight as convictions suggest a history of criminal behavior.\n3. Divorced: Medium weight, since divorce can affect financial stability and access to resources.\n4. GED certificate: Low weight, as lack of formal education might not significantly impact future life choices.\n5. Held 2 jobs during the year: Low weight, given limited work experience is unlikely to hinder career advancement.\n6. No drug use in the past four years: High weight, as no substance abuse issues are a positive sign.\n7. Most of the time, felt down in the dumps without cheerfulness: Medium weight, indicating potential mental health concerns.\n\nNow, let me assign these weights:\n\n- Arrested 7 times: high\n- Convicted: high\n- Divorced: medium\n- GED certificate: low\n- Held 2 jobs during the year: low\n- No drug use in the past four years: high\n- Most of the time, felt down in the dumps without cheerfulness: medium\n\nLet me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. The multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of a pattern of criminal behavior. The lack of formal education might not significantly impact future life choices, but financial stability is questionable due to divorce. The no drug use in the past four years is a positive sign, but the mental health concerns from feeling down in the dumps without cheerfulness are significant.\n\nWait a minute... Given these factors, I need to carefully consider how they collectively predict the outcome. The strong indicators of criminal behavior and financial instability weigh heavily against low recidivism. However, the positive factor of no drug use suggests some level of resilience.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrested 7 times\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of breaking laws.\"),\n    (\"Convicted\", \"high\", \"Consecutive convictions suggest a history of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Divorced\", \"medium\", \"Financial instability may impact access to resources and support networks.\"),\n    (\"GED certificate\", \"low\", \"Limited formal education may not significantly affect future life choices.\"),\n    (\"Held 2 jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Limited work experience is unlikely to hinder career advancement.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in the past four years\", \"high\", \"Absence of substance abuse issues suggests a positive trend.\"),\n    (\"Most of the time, felt down in the dumps without cheerfulness\", \"medium\", \"Potential mental health concerns may influence decision-making and rehabilitation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
