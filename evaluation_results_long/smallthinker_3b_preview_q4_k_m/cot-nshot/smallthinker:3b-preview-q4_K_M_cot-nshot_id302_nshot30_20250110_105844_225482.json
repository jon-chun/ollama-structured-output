    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case of a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the key points from the case description:\n- The person has been arrested once and convicted.\n- She is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 135 lbs.\n- She has never been married and lives alone.\n- She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college.\n- She has held three jobs during the year.\n- She has used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years.\n- At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area.\n- She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nNow, let's break down each risk factor and assign a relative weight:\n\n1. Arrested once and convicted:\n   - This is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior.\n   - Weight: high\n\n2. Age (21 years):\n   - The age is within the typical range for arrests and convictions.\n   - Weight: medium\n\n3. Height and weight:\n   - These are physical attributes that do not directly correlate with recidivism.\n   - Weight: low\n\n4. Never married and lives alone:\n   - This might indicate a lack of social support, which could be a factor.\n   - Weight: medium\n\n5. High school diploma but not enrolled in college:\n   - Higher education can be associated with lower crime rates.\n   - Weight: low\n\n6. Used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years:\n   - Drug use is often linked to criminal activity.\n   - Weight: high\n\n7. Biological mother's influence:\n   - Living with a biological parent could have both positive and negative impacts.\n   - Weight: medium\n\n8. Belief in God's role:\n   - This belief might affect her life choices and risk-taking behaviors.\n   - Weight: low\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\n- The arrest and conviction are significant indicators of past criminal behavior.\n- Drug use is also a strong indicator of future criminal activity.\n- Age and lack of social support might not be as critical in this case.\n\nConsidering all these points, I can confidently say that the risk factors point towards a higher likelihood of recidivism. Therefore, my prediction is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrested once and convicted\", \"high\", \"This indicates past criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age (21 years)\", \"medium\", \"Age within typical range for arrests and convictions.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"These are physical attributes without direct correlation to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"never married and lives alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support might indicate different risk factors.\"),\n    (\"high school diploma but not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Higher education may lower crime rates.\"),\n    (\"used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years\", \"high\", \"Drug use often linked to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"biological mother's influence\", \"medium\", \"Complex relationship with biological parents can impact risk factors.\"),\n    (\"belief in God's role\", \"low\", \"Belief might affect life choices and risk-taking behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
