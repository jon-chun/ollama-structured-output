    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors for a case involving an 18-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested once and convicted. She is currently married and enrolled in school, with no prior jobs or substance use issues. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age range:\n- Age: 18-24\n  - Low (young adult)\n    - Reasoning: The individual is still a young adult and may be more susceptible to peer pressure and influences that could lead to recidivism.\n  Wait, let me think... This factor seems low because the individual is young but already has some stability from being married and enrolled in school.\n\nNext, her conviction history:\n- Convicted\n  - High (significant risk)\n    - Reasoning: A conviction history significantly increases the risk of rearrest recidivism.\n  Wait a minute... Given that she has been convicted once, this is clearly a high-risk factor.\n\nNow, marital status:\n- Married\n  - Low (may reduce risk due to support system)\n    - Reasoning: Being married can provide emotional and financial support, which may mitigate some risks.\n  Let me check... The fact that she is married seems to be a low-risk factor because it suggests she has a supportive environment.\n\nEducational status:\n- Enrolled in school\n  - Low (may reduce risk due to educational focus)\n    - Reasoning: Being enrolled in school can distract from criminal activities and provide future opportunities.\n  That makes sense... Her enrollment in school is indeed a low-risk factor.\n\nSubstance use history:\n- No substance use\n  - Low (no significant risk)\n    - Reasoning: Lack of substance use history reduces the likelihood of recidivism related to drug offenses.\n  Alright, this seems straightforward... Since she has no substance use issues, it's a low-risk factor.\n\nAge at last arrest:\n- 18 years old\n  - Medium (early in adult life)\n    - Reasoning: Being only 18 when arrested suggests that she is still developing and may face unique challenges.\n  Wait, let me think... At age 18, it's medium risk because she is still relatively young.\n\nLength of time since last arrest:\n- Less than one year\n  - Medium (recent activity)\n    - Reasoning: Recent involvement in criminal activities increases the likelihood of rearrest recidivism.\n  That makes sense... Given that it has been less than a year, this is a medium-risk factor.\n\nNumber of previous arrests:\n- 1 time\n  - Low (fewer incidents)\n    - Reasoning: A single conviction does not necessarily indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n  Alright, low risk due to the limited number of past incidents.\n\nNow, let's aggregate these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Considering all the above factors, I will assign relative weights as follows:\n\n- Age range: Medium\n- Conviction history: High\n- Marital status: Low\n- Educational status: Low\n- Substance use history: Low\n- Age at last arrest: Medium\n- Length of time since last arrest: Medium\n- Number of previous arrests: Low\n\nAfter careful consideration, I predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_range\", \"medium\", \"young adult\"),\n    (\"convicted\", \"high\", \"significant risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"may reduce risk due to support system\"),\n    (\"educational_status\", \"low\", \"may reduce risk due to educational focus\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\", \"no significant risk\"),\n    (\"age_at_last_arrest\", \"medium\", \"early in adult life\"),\n    (\"length_of_time_since_last_arrest\", \"medium\", \"recent activity\"),\n    (\"number_of_previous_arrests\", \"low\", \"fewer incidents\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
