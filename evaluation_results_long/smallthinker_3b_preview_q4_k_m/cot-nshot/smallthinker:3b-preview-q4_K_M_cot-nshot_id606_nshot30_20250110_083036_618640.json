    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully think through the risk factors one by one and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arrest history. The person has been arrested twice, which is quite significant. Let me think... This could be a strong indicator of future criminal behavior. So, I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nNext, conviction status. The person has been convicted once. This suggests a pattern of breaking the law and potentially a higher likelihood of reoffending. Therefore, I'll also assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone. While this might not directly correlate with criminal behavior, it could indicate a lack of support system, which might be linked to increased risk-taking behaviors. However, this seems less impactful compared to the other factors, so I'll assign a medium weight here.\n\nDrug use history: The person has used drugs in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be indicative of higher risk behavior, but the lack of depression might suggest some resilience. So, I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nFamily background: Living with both biological parents. This could indicate a supportive environment that might mitigate risky behaviors. However, it's not as impactful as the other factors in terms of predicting recidivism, so I'll assign a low weight here.\n\nBelief in divine intervention: The person considers God's influence on their life. This belief might affect their willingness to take risks or seek help, but it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let me combine these factors and predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Given the high arrest history, conviction status, and drug use history, along with a low impact from living situation and family background, I'm going to assign a medium-high confidence level to my prediction.\n\nLet me check... The combination of these factors suggests a higher likelihood of reoffending within three years. So, my final prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 85%.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested twice, which is a strong indicator of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"high\", \"A single conviction can suggest a pattern of breaking the law and potentially higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone may indicate a lack of support system but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"Drug use history is a significant risk factor for reoffending, although the absence of depression might suggest some resilience.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents likely provides a supportive environment that could mitigate risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_divine_intervention\", \"medium\", \"This belief may affect behavior but doesn't directly correlate with criminal activity.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
