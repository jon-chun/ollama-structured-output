    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided in the case study and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each before using them collectively to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors:\n1. Age: 22 years old.\n2. Convicted arrest: Yes.\n3. Weight and height: Not relevant for recidivism prediction.\n4. Education level: High school diploma.\n5. Number of jobs held: 2.\n6. Use of drugs in past four years: No.\n7. Living situation: Currently living with spouse.\n\nNow, let's assign weights to these factors:\n1. Age: Let me check the data on this. Generally, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity and lack of life experience. However, at 22, they are still relatively young, so I'll assign a medium weight.\n2. Convicted arrest: This is a clear indicator of high risk. If they've been convicted once, it suggests a pattern of criminal behavior.\n3. Weight and height: These factors are not relevant for recidivism prediction, so I'll assign a low weight.\n4. Education level: A high school diploma might indicate some limitations in life skills and decision-making, but it's not a strong indicator of recidivism alone.\n5. Number of jobs held: This could be seen as a positive factor if the individual is employed consistently, indicating stability.\n6. Use of drugs in past four years: No use suggests lower risk.\n7. Living situation: Currently living with spouse might indicate some support system, but it's not directly relevant to recidivism.\n\nLet me summarize these assignments:\n- Age: medium\n- Convicted arrest: high\n- Weight and height: low\n- Education level: low\n- Number of jobs held: low\n- Use of drugs in past four years: low\n- Living situation: low\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. The most significant factor here is the convicted arrest and age.\n\nWait a minute... Given that the individual has been convicted once and is relatively young, it suggests a higher risk of recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign a medium weight to this combination.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"the person is 22 years old\"),\n    (\"convicted_arrest\", \"high\", \"she has been convicted once\"),\n    (\"weight_and_height\", \"low\", \"her weight and height are not relevant for recidivism prediction\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"she has a high school diploma\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs_held\", \"low\", \"she has held 2 jobs during the year\"),\n    (\"use_of_drugs_in_past_four_years\", \"low\", \"she has not used any drugs in the past four years\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"she is currently living with her spouse\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
