    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the provided n-shot examples and apply a weighted risk factor analysis to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for the given case. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key risk factors in the given case:\n- Age: 22 years old\n- Convicted status: Yes\n- Weights: 5 feet 5 inches and 214 lbs\n- Employment: No jobs in the past year\n- Substance use: No drugs used in the past four years, but feels down at times during the past month\n\nNow, let me break down each factor and assign a relative weight to it. I'll start with age and conviction status because these are strong indicators of recidivism.\n\n1. **Age**: At 22 years old, the individual is still young and has significant time before reaching the legal adult age. This factor is crucial but not as directly impactful as other factors in predicting recidivism.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n2. **Convicted status**: The individual has been convicted once. This significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n   - Weight: High\n\n3. **Weighs**: The weight is provided, but it's a continuous variable that might not be directly relevant to recidivism prediction without additional context or normalization.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n4. **Employed status**: The individual has no jobs in the past year. Lack of employment can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as an alternative means of support.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n5. **Substance use**: No drugs used, but feelings of despair suggest potential issues with mental health or substance abuse that could lead to criminal activity.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n6. **Living situation**: Separated and living alone can be a risk factor for behavioral changes due to isolation.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. The individual's convicted status is a significant factor, and her current living situation and potential feelings of despair could also influence her behavior.\n\nLet me check my analysis again:\n- Convicted status (High)\n- Age (Medium)\n- Weighs (Low)\n- Employed status (Medium)\n- Substance use (Low)\n- Living situation (Medium)\n\nGiven these weights, the collective prediction should reflect a high likelihood of recidivism. However, I need to assign a confidence level based on how strongly these factors align with past behavior.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is likely to be positive.\n\nHere's my final answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"young age increases likelihood of behavioral changes\"),\n    (\"convicted_status\", \"high\", \"recent conviction significantly raises risk of future crime\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"provided but not directly relevant without additional context\"),\n    (\"employed_status\", \"medium\", \"lack of employment may increase risk due to financial instability\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"no drugs used, but feelings of despair suggest potential issues\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"separated and alone may influence behavioral changes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
