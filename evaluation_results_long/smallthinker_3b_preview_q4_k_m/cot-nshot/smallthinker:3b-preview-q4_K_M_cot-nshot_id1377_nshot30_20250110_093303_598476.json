    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I'll need to carefully analyze the given case and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors involved in this analysis:\n\n1. Age: The person is 21 years old.\n2. Criminal history: She has been arrested twice and convicted once.\n3. Education level: She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate.\n4. Employment status: She has held only one job during the year.\n5. Substance abuse: She has used cocaine in the past four years, and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.\n6. Family background: She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area.\n\nNow, let's consider each factor:\n\n1. Age: Being young can be seen as both a risk and a mitigating factor. Young adults might still be developing their life skills, but they also have the potential to learn from mistakes.\n   - Low\n\n2. Criminal history: Multiple arrests and convictions are significant indicators of higher recidivism risk.\n   - High\n\n3. Education level: Lack of formal education can impact an individual's ability to find stable employment and navigate society effectively.\n   - Medium\n\n4. Employment status: Holding only one job over a year suggests unemployment or limited job experience, which could affect future employability.\n   - Low\n\n5. Substance abuse: Recent use of cocaine indicates ongoing substance issues that can complicate rehabilitation efforts.\n   - High\n\n6. Family background: Living with a biological mother in an urban household might suggest some support but also potential exposure to challenging environments.\n   - Medium\n\nLet me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nWait, let me check the instruction again to ensure I'm on track. The case involves a young adult with multiple arrests and convictions, limited education, unemployment, substance abuse issues, and potentially challenging family environment. These factors suggest a high risk of recidivism.\n\nNow, let's make a prediction based on this analysis:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young age can be both risky due to potential impulsiveness and mitigating due to the possibility of learning from mistakes.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions are significant indicators of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of formal education can impact employability and rehabilitation efforts.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Unemployment suggests potential for re-offending.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent cocaine use indicates ongoing substance issues that can complicate rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban household might suggest some support but also exposure to challenging environments.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
