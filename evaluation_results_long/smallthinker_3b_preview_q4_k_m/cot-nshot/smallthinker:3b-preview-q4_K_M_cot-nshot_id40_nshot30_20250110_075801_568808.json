    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I have this case to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let's see what factors are important here.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age might be relevant; younger adults sometimes have higher recidivism rates because they're still forming their adult identities and behaviors. But it's not clear how to assign a weight to age in this context.\n\nHe has been arrested 3 times and convicted. That's pretty significant. Each conviction likely increases the risk of rearrest. The more convictions, the higher the risk. So, this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nCurrently, he's separated and living alone. Separation might indicate instability or problems within his relationship, which could affect his behavior and decision-making. But I'm not sure how to quantify that in terms of recidivism risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college. Education level is often linked to employment opportunities and life choices. Without a formal education, he might be more likely to engage in criminal activities as a means to support himself. So, this could be a medium to high-risk factor depending on how much of an impact education has on criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. This suggests unemployment or perhaps job instability. Unemployed individuals might turn to crime for financial gain. So, no employment history is likely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can be associated with criminal activity, especially if it involves selling drugs or dealing. The more drugs he's used, the higher the risk. But since it's not specified how many times he's used each drug, I'll assume that using drugs at all is a medium to high-risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, living with adults other than biological parents, in an urban area. This might suggest that he's been exposed to different environments and possibly influences that could lead him into criminal activities. Again, it's hard to assign a specific weight here.\n\nNow, considering these factors:\n\n1. Age: Medium (20-30 is a critical period for forming adult behaviors)\n\n2. Convictions/convicted: High\n\n3. Separated/living alone: Low-Medium (unstable situation could lead to risky behavior)\n\n4. Education level: Medium-High (no formal education might limit employment options and increase criminal activity)\n\n5. Unemployment: High\n\n6. Drug use: Medium-High (using drugs is often associated with criminal activities)\n\n7. Living conditions: Low-Medium (urban area, possibly exposed to negative influences)\n\nGiven that he has multiple convictions, is unemployed, and has been using drugs, it seems likely that he's at high risk of rearrest again in 3 years.\n\nSo, my prediction would be \"YES,\" indicating a higher likelihood of rearrest recidivism. My confidence level is around 80%, considering the multiple negative factors accumulated in this case.\n\nHere's how I'd structure the JSON object:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"age\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n\n(\"convictions_convicted\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n\n(\"separated_living_alone\", \"low_medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n\n(\"education_level\", \"medium_high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n\n(\"unemployed\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n\n(\"drug_use\", \"medium_high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n\n(\"living_conditions\", \"low_medium\", \"textual reasoning\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 80\n\n}\n\nI think that covers all the relevant factors and provides a reasonable prediction based on the analysis.",
