    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided in the case study and assign a relative weight to each one. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the risk factors for this particular case:\n- Number of arrests: 6 times\n- Convictions: 6 times\n- Age: 22 years old\n- Education level: No high school diploma or GED certificate\n- Employment status: Held 2 jobs during the year\n- Drug use in the past four years: Marijuana\n- Living situation: Currently living alone\n- Belief in a higher power: Yes, God has something to do with what happens\n\nLet me break this down one by one and think about how each factor might influence the prediction.\n\n1. **Number of arrests**: 6 times.\n   - This is a significant number of arrests over a short period. It suggests a pattern of criminal behavior that could indicate a higher risk of future offenses.\n   - Weight: High\n\n2. **Convictions**: 6 times.\n   - Similar to the number of arrests, convictions are a strong indicator of ongoing criminal activity.\n   - Weight: High\n\n3. **Age**: 22 years old.\n   - Age is a factor in recidivism rates, but for someone in their early twenties with multiple arrests and convictions, it suggests that age may not be as protective against future offenses.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n4. **Education level**: No high school diploma or GED certificate.\n   - Lack of formal education can sometimes correlate with a higher risk of criminal behavior due to lack of structured learning and role models.\n   - Weight: High\n\n5. **Employment status**: Held 2 jobs during the year.\n   - Holding down multiple jobs might indicate some stability, but it's not a strong indicator for recidivism in this context.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n6. **Drug use in the past four years**: Marijuana.\n   - Drug use is often associated with higher recidivism rates due to the criminal activity surrounding the drug trade.\n   - Weight: High\n\n7. **Living situation**: Currently living alone.\n   - Living alone doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, but it's not a strong factor either.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n8. **Belief in a higher power**: Yes, God has something to do with what happens.\n   - This belief might influence an individual's approach to life and crime, potentially reducing the likelihood of future offenses.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\n- High-risk factors include number of arrests, convictions, drug use, and education level.\n- Medium-risk factors include age, living situation, and belief in a higher power.\n- Low-risk factor is employment status.\n\nGiven this analysis, it seems that the case falls into the high-risk category for recidivism. Let me check my calculations one more time to ensure I'm confident in this prediction.\n\nAfter careful consideration, here's my final prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"The number of arrests suggests a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate ongoing criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age is not as protective against future offenses in this context.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of formal education may correlate with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"low\", \"Holding down multiple jobs doesn't strongly indicate lower risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use in the past four years\", \"high\", \"Drug use is often associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"belief in a higher power\", \"medium\", \"This belief might influence an individual's approach to life and crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
