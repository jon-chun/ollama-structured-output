    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case based on the provided examples. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors for this case:\n- Arrested: No conviction.\n- Age: 18 years old.\n- Gender: Male.\n- Race: White.\n- Marital status: Married.\n- Education: No high school diploma or GED certificate.\n- Employment: Held 2 jobs during the year.\n- Drug use: No drugs used in the past four years.\n- Depression: No depression felt over the past month.\n- Family background: Lived with biological mother, household size 3, rural area.\n\nNow, let me check each risk factor against the examples provided. I'll assign a relative weight to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\n\nLet me start with arrested status. The case shows no conviction, which is quite different from some of the cases where there were convictions. So, I'll give this factor a low weight.\n\nNext, age: 18 years old. The examples show younger ages (often under 20) as high risk factors for recidivism. So, I'll assign a medium weight to age.\n\nGender: Male. In some of the examples, male status was associated with higher recidivism rates. I'll give this factor a low to medium weight.\n\nRace: White. The examples show mixed results regarding race and recidivism, so I'll give this factor a low weight.\n\nMarital status: Married. Some cases showed that being married could reduce the risk of recidivism. So, I'll assign a medium weight to marital status.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED certificate. This is a significant factor in some of the examples, as it was associated with higher recidivism rates. I'll give this factor a high weight.\n\nEmployment: Held 2 jobs during the year. The examples show that employment stability could be a protective factor against recidivism. So, I'll assign a medium weight to employment.\n\nDrug use: No drugs used in the past four years. This is a positive factor, reducing the risk of recidivism. I'll give this factor a low weight.\n\nDepression: No depression felt over the past month. This is also a protective factor against recidivism. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother, household size 3, rural area. The examples show mixed results regarding family background and recidivism. However, living with parents or siblings could potentially reduce the risk of recidivism. So, I'll give this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let me combine these weights to predict the outcome:\n\n- Arrested (low)\n- Age (medium)\n- Gender (low to medium)\n- Race (low)\n- Married (medium)\n- Education (high)\n- Employment (medium)\n- Drug use (low)\n- Depression (low)\n- Family background (medium)\n\nLet me calculate the total weight:\n(1 low) + (2 medium) + (1 low) + (1 medium) + (1 high) = 6\n\nThe prediction is based on a weighted average of these factors. Given the combination and the weights, I'll predict that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is \"NO\".\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrested\", \"low\", \"no conviction\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low to medium\", \"male\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"white\"),\n    (\"married\", \"medium\", \"currently living with spouse\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"no high school diploma or GED certificate\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"held 2 jobs during the year\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drugs used in the past four years\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"no depression felt over the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"lived with biological mother, household size 3, rural area\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
