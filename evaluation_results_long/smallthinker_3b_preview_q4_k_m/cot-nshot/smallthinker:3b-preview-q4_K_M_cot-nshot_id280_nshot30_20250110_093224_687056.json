    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for this case and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each factor. Then, I will use these weights to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\n\nLet me start by breaking down the risk factors:\n\n1. **Number of arrests**: The person has been arrested 6 times but has not been convicted. This suggests a pattern of behavior that may indicate a higher risk of future arrests.\n2. **Age at arrest**: The person is 21 years old, which means they are in their late teens to early twenties. This age range often sees high recidivism rates due to the influence of peers and immature decision-making.\n3. **Education level**: The person does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate. Lack of formal education can be linked to lower socioeconomic status, which may affect opportunities and life choices.\n4. **Employment history**: The person has held only 1 job during the year. This could indicate instability in employment, possibly due to lack of education or other factors.\n5. **Drug use**: The person has not used any drugs in the past four years. While this is positive, it does not provide a clear indication of future behavior without substance use.\n\nNow, let me think about how these risk factors interact and influence each other:\n\n- The number of arrests (factor1) seems to have a high weight because it indicates a pattern of behavior.\n- Age at arrest (factor2) has a medium weight due to the general recidivism rates for this age group.\n- Education level (factor3) also has a medium weight, as lower education can affect opportunities and life choices.\n- Employment history (factor4) has a low weight because it only shows one job in a year, which is not necessarily indicative of future behavior without substance use.\n- Drug use (factor5) has a high weight because no drug use is positive but does not provide clear future behavior insights.\n\nLet me break down the reasoning for each factor:\n\n1. **Number of arrests**: Given that the person has been arrested 6 times but has not been convicted, this suggests a pattern of behavior that may indicate a higher risk of future arrests.\n2. **Age at arrest**: The person is 21 years old, which means they are in their late teens to early twenties. This age range often sees high recidivism rates due to the influence of peers and immature decision-making.\n3. **Education level**: The person does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate. Lack of formal education can be linked to lower socioeconomic status, which may affect opportunities and life choices.\n4. **Employment history**: The person has held only 1 job during the year. This could indicate instability in employment, possibly due to lack of education or other factors.\n5. **Drug use**: The person has not used any drugs in the past four years. While this is positive, it does not provide a clear indication of future behavior without substance use.\n\nNow, let me combine these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- Factor1 (Number of arrests): High\n- Factor2 (Age at arrest): Medium\n- Factor3 (Education level): Medium\n- Factor4 (Employment history): Low\n- Factor5 (Drug use): High\n\nGiven the high weights for factors1 and factor5, I predict that this case will have a higher risk of rearrest recidivism. However, the low weight for factor4 suggests some mitigation.\n\nLet me think about the confidence level:\n\n- The combination of high arrest rates and no drug use indicates a high risk.\n- The age and education levels suggest a medium to high risk as well.\n- The employment history is a mitigating factor but not decisive.\n\nI will assign a confidence level between 60% and 70%.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"high\", \"the person has been arrested multiple times, indicating a pattern of behavior that may lead to future arrests\"),\n    (\"age at arrest\", \"medium\", \"the person's age suggests they are in their late teens to early twenties, a stage with high recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"lack of formal education can affect socioeconomic status and life choices\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"only one job in a year may indicate employment instability without clear future behavior indicators\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"no drug use is positive, but no substance use patterns are observed to indicate future behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
