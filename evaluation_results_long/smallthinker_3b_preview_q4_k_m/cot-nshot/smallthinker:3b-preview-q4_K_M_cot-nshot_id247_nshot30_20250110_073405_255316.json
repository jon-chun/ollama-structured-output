    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each factor before using them collectively to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the key risk factors:\n\n1. Age - The person is 20 years old.\n2. Arrests and convictions - He has been arrested twice and convicted once.\n3. Marriage status - He is married.\n4. Education level - He has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college.\n5. Drug use history - He has used drugs in the past four years.\n6. Family background - He lived with both biological parents.\n\nNow, let me break down each factor and assign a weight:\n\n1. Age: 20 years old. This factor seems to have little impact on recidivism rates compared to other factors, so I'll assign it a low weight.\n2. Arrests and convictions: The person has been arrested twice and convicted once. This suggests a higher risk of recidivism, so I'll assign it a medium weight.\n3. Marriage status: Being married might reduce the likelihood of reoffending due to social support, so I'll assign it a low weight.\n4. Education level: A high school diploma but not enrolled in college indicates limited education and potentially lower employability, which could increase recidivism risk. So, I'll assign it a medium weight.\n5. Drug use history: Using drugs in the past four years is a significant factor indicating a higher risk of reoffending. Therefore, I'll assign it a high weight.\n6. Family background: Living with both biological parents might provide support and stability, potentially reducing recidivism risk, so I'll assign it a low weight.\n\nNow, let's use these weights to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- Arrests and convictions (medium) has a significant impact.\n- Drug use history (high) also has a substantial impact.\n- Education level (medium) and family background (low) have moderate impacts.\n- Age (low) and marriage status (low) have minimal impacts.\n\nGiven these factors, the collective prediction is that the risk of rearrest recidivism within 3 years is high. Therefore, I'll predict \"YES\" with a confidence of 85%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The person being 20 years old has little impact on recidivism rates compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"arrests_and_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction suggest a higher risk of reoffending, particularly within the first three years.\"),\n    (\"marriage_status\", \"low\", \"Being married may reduce the likelihood of reoffending due to social support and stability.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college indicates limited education and potentially lower employability, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"Using drugs in the past four years is a significant factor indicating a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents may provide support and stability, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
