    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the risk factors step by step before making a prediction. I'll assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each factor based on the provided examples.\n\nFirst, consider the arrest history:\n- Factor1: The person has been arrested 1 time but not convicted.\n  - Weight: Medium\n  - Reasoning: Based on n-shot examples, this indicates some level of criminal behavior but with a lack of conviction. It suggests a medium risk.\n\nNext, look at educational attainment:\n- Factor2: No high school diploma or GED certificate.\n  - Weight: High\n  - Reasoning: The absence of formal education often correlates with higher crime rates. This factor significantly impacts the prediction.\n\nThen, examine employment status:\n- Factor3: No jobs held during the year.\n  - Weight: Medium\n  - Reasoning: Lack of employment history can indicate a high risk of continued criminal behavior. However, this is balanced by other factors in this case.\n\nNow, analyze substance use:\n- Factor4: No drugs used in the past four years.\n  - Weight: Low\n  - Reasoning: The absence of drug use suggests a lower risk compared to heavy users. This factor mitigates some of the other risks.\n\nFinally, consider personal philosophy towards God:\n- Factor5: Believes God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n  - Weight: Medium\n  - Reasoning: This indicates a lack of moral compass or belief in societal rules, which can correlate with higher crime rates. However, it's balanced by other factors in this case.\n\nLet me now combine these weights to make a prediction:\n- Low weight (substance use) mitigates some risks.\n- Medium and high weights (arrest history, educational attainment, lack of employment) suggest a higher risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, I predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case as follows:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned based on n-shot examples indicating some level of criminal behavior but with a lack of conviction.\"),\n    (\"educational_attainment\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to the absence of formal education, often correlating with higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to the lack of employment history, suggesting a high risk of continued criminal behavior but balanced by other factors in this case.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned due to the absence of drug use, suggesting a lower risk compared to heavy users. This factor mitigates some of the other risks.\"),\n    (\"personal_perspective_on_god\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to the lack of belief in God's influence on life, potentially indicating a higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
