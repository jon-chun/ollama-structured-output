    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for this case and assign a relative weight to each before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out the risk factors:\n\n1. Age - 22\n2. Convicted once in past four years\n3. Married\n4. GED certificate\n5. No depression in past month\n6. Lived with adults other than biological parents\n\nNow, I need to think about how each of these factors contributes to the likelihood of rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet me start with age - 22. This is a relatively young adult, and while youth can sometimes be associated with impulsivity, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior in this context. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nNext, being convicted once in the past four years is a significant risk factor. Conviction history is strongly correlated with future criminal activity, so I'll assign a medium weight here.\n\nMarriage could be seen as protective, as stable living conditions might reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. However, it's not directly linked to recidivism, so I'll assign a low weight.\n\nA GED certificate indicates some level of education but does not necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. So, I'll also assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month suggests emotional stability and possibly reduced risk of impulsive behavior. Again, this doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, so I'll assign a low weight here as well.\n\nFinally, living with adults other than biological parents could indicate some level of instability or lack of family support, which might slightly increase the risk of criminal behavior. So, I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's consider how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n- Medium (convicted once)\n- Medium (lived with adults other than biological parents)\n- Low (age, GED certificate, no depression)\n\nLet me think about this carefully. The combination of a conviction and living with non-biological parents suggests a higher risk of recidivism compared to the individual factors alone.\n\nWait a minute... I need to assign a relative weight to each factor before using them collectively. This is crucial for accurate prediction. Let's reassess:\n\n- Medium (convicted once)\n- Low (age, GED certificate)\n- Medium (lived with adults other than biological parents)\n- Low (no depression)\n\nNow, with these weights in mind, I can predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nLet me check my calculations again. The conviction and living with non-biological parents are significant factors. Given this, I'll assign a high weight to these factors collectively.\n\nFantastic! After all these considerations, I can confidently say that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"convicted_once\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"married\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"ged_certificate\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"no_depression\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"lived_with_adults_other_than_biological_parents\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
