    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, let me carefully analyze the case step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context and the risk factors involved. The person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted, which is an important point to consider. Her physical attributes are also provided: she's 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 145 lbs. Additionally, she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. She has held three jobs during the year and has used marijuana in the past four years, with most of the time feeling down to the point where nothing could cheer her up.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors contribute to her risk of rearrest recidivism over a 3-year period.\n\nLet's start with the conviction history. The fact that she hasn't been convicted at all is a significant positive factor, as it suggests that while she may have engaged in criminal behavior, she has not been held accountable for it legally. This could indicate a lower risk of reoffending, especially considering her other factors.\n\nNext, let's consider the arrest history. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. This raises some red flags because it shows that she has had contact with law enforcement in the past, which could potentially influence her future behavior. However, since she hasn't been convicted, it suggests that the legal system might see this as a less severe offense.\n\nHer age and gender are also important factors. Being 19 years old means she is still relatively young and may have more time to grow and change. Being female adds another layer of complexity, as studies often show different patterns of recidivism among genders.\n\nEducation level is another key factor. The fact that she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate could indicate a lack of formal education, which might affect her ability to find stable employment and contribute positively to society. This could potentially increase her risk of reoffending if she feels unsupported by the system.\n\nEmployment history shows that she has held three jobs during the year. While this is positive in terms of gaining work experience, it also suggests a potential lack of long-term commitment to any one job, which might be seen as inconsistent with stable employment patterns often associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHer substance use history includes using marijuana in the past four years, and most of the time she has felt down. This could indicate underlying mental health issues or other psychological factors that may influence her behavior and decision-making in the future.\n\nLastly, her consideration of God's role in her life might provide a positive support system and a sense of purpose, which could help mitigate the risk of reoffending. However, this factor is somewhat subjective and would require further analysis to fully understand its impact.\n\nNow, let me combine these factors to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Considering all the above factors, I will assign weights as follows:\n\n- Conviction history: high (low risk of reoffending)\n- Arrest history: medium (some risk due to past contact with law enforcement)\n- Age and gender: low\n- Education level: medium (potential for change through education)\n- Employment history: medium (consistent but not stable)\n- Substance use history: high (increases risk of reoffending)\n- Support system: medium (positive influence)\n\nBased on these weights, I predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome to be \"NO\" with a confidence level of 70%.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"low risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"some risk due to past contact with law enforcement\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"still relatively young and less likely to reoffend\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"potential for change through education\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"consistent but not stable\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"increases risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"support_system\", \"medium\", \"positive influence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
