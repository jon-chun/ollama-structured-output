    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the individual's demographic information: 20-year-old male, Black identity, no conviction for a previous arrest, physical attributes (6 feet 0 inches, 160 lbs), marital status (never married, living alone), educational background (high school diploma, not enrolled in college), employment history (held 2 jobs during the year), substance abuse history (used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana), and personal experiences (lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area).\n\nWait a minute... Let me break down each risk factor to understand its potential impact on the individual's behavior or likelihood of engaging in criminal activity. \n\nThe lack of conviction for his previous arrest is a positive aspect, but it doesn't necessarily indicate low risk; many people who are arrested do not go through with convictions due to various reasons such as bail issues or lack of evidence.\n\nLet me check the substance abuse history... The fact that he has used drugs in the past four years and some days feels so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up suggests potential emotional instability, which could be a risk factor. However, I need to consider other factors as well before making a judgment.\n\nNow, thinking about his educational background and employment history... He has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college, and he held two jobs during the year. This information might indicate some level of independence and financial stability, which could be mitigating factors against engaging in criminal activity.\n\nConsidering his living situation and personal beliefs... Living with both biological parents in an urban area and identifying that God has something to do with what happens to him personally are significant aspects. While these factors can provide a sense of structure and purpose, they might also indicate potential vulnerabilities or influences that could impact behavior.\n\nLet me think about how all these factors interact... The combination of his substance abuse history, emotional instability, lack of conviction for arrest (which might suggest some level of resilience), and personal beliefs needs to be considered holistically. It's crucial to weigh each factor against others to make an informed decision.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe that the presence of multiple risk factors, including substance abuse, emotional vulnerability, and a history of living in potentially challenging environments, suggests a higher likelihood of engaging in high-risk behavior.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, my prediction is that these risk factors do indicate high risk. My confidence level in this conclusion is around 85%, considering the weight of each factor against others and the potential for mitigating or exacerbating influences.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
