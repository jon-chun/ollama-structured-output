    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the information step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his demographic information:\n- Age: 19 years old.\n- Race/ethnicity: Black.\n- Height: 5 feet 8 inches.\n- Weight: 170 lbs.\n\nThese details alone don't seem particularly concerning, but they are important to note for the context of our analysis. Let me think about this more carefully - these factors might not be directly indicative of criminal behavior, but they could influence how law enforcement or legal systems perceive him.\n\nNext, let's look at his arrest history:\n- He has been arrested twice but has not been convicted.\nThis is a significant factor. Being arrested multiple times without conviction can suggest a pattern of potentially problematic behavior or involvement in activities that lead to arrests. Let me think about this - while it doesn't necessarily mean he will commit crimes, it does indicate some level of risk.\n\nNow, let's examine his educational and employment status:\n- He has never been married.\n- Currently living alone.\n- No high school diploma or GED certificate.\n- Not enrolled in college.\n- Held no jobs during the year.\n\nThis information suggests that he is not currently engaged in any formal education or employment. This could be a risk factor, as it might indicate a lack of structured life and possibly a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Let me think about this - without a regular income or structured routine, an individual might feel more inclined to explore illegal activities.\n\nMoving on to his substance use:\n- He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana).\n- Most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.\nThis is a concerning factor. Regular drug use and periods of deep emotional distress can be indicative of underlying issues or risk factors for criminal behavior. Let me think about this - these symptoms might suggest mental health concerns or a history of trauma, which could contribute to his involvement in risky activities.\n\nFinally, let's consider his personal beliefs:\n- He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nThis statement is interesting but doesn't directly indicate any risk factors. It suggests a strong belief system and possibly a higher likelihood of seeking help or guidance from religious institutions.\n\nNow, let me synthesize all these factors:\n- Multiple arrests without conviction suggest a pattern of potentially problematic behavior.\n- Unemployment and lack of education could indicate a higher risk for engaging in risky behaviors.\n- Drug use and periods of deep emotional distress are significant indicators of potential mental health issues or involvement in substance-related crimes.\n\nConsidering all these points, it seems that the combination of arrest history, employment status, educational attainment, drug use, and emotional state indicates a high-risk profile. This suggests that he may be more likely to engage in criminal behavior.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
