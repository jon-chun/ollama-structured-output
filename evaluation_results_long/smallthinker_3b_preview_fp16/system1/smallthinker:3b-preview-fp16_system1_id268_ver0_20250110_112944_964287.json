    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high-risk individual. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. They have been arrested 4 times and convicted, which is quite alarming. Wait, let me check the frequency of these arrests - it seems like a significant number in a relatively short period. This could be a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nNext, I'll consider their substance use. The fact that they have used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, is another concern. However, it's essential to note that this behavior alone may not be enough to classify them as high-risk, especially since they haven't felt depressed over the past month. Let me think about this for a moment... \n\nNow, I'll analyze their social and economic background. They are 21 years old, male, Hispanic, and living alone in an urban area. This information doesn't seem to be directly relevant to risk assessment, but it's still important to consider the context. For instance, growing up in a household of size 5 with both biological parents could provide valuable insights into their family dynamics.\n\nAnother crucial aspect is their personal beliefs. The person considers that God has something to do with what happens to them personally. This could be seen as a potential risk factor, but it's also essential to recognize the complexity of this belief system and how it might influence their decision-making processes.\n\nLet me break down the analysis further... I have identified several key factors: multiple arrests and convictions, substance use, living alone, family dynamics, and personal beliefs. While each of these factors individually may not be enough to determine high risk, the combination of them raises concerns.\n\nNow, let's calculate the confidence level based on these factors. Given the frequency of their arrests, the presence of substance use, and other relevant factors, I would estimate the confidence level to be around 80%. Wait a minute... this estimate is not fixed; it could change with more information or further analysis.\n\nAfter careful consideration, my prediction for this individual's risk profile is that they do indicate high risk. Therefore, my response will be:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
