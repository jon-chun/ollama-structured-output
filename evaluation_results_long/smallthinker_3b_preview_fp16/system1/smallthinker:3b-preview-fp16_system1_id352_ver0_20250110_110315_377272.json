    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully evaluate the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's history of arrests and convictions. The fact that he has been arrested 2 times and convicted seems like a significant factor. Wait, let me check the specifics - yes, his conviction record is also quite severe. This could be a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nNext, I'll examine his socioeconomic status. He identifies as White, which doesn't seem to be directly relevant to the risk assessment. However, his 6 feet 3 inches and 190 lbs might suggest he has some level of physical strength or endurance. Let me think about this for a moment - while this information could potentially influence how he interacts with law enforcement or other individuals, it doesn't seem like a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nNow, let's consider his personal life. He is currently living alone and has never been married. This might suggest some level of independence, but it also raises concerns about potential social isolation or lack of support systems. Hmm, this could be an area where he might benefit from additional guidance or resources.\n\nMoving on to his educational attainment, I see that he holds a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This indicates some level of commitment to education and personal development. Let me think about how this factors into the risk assessment - while it's generally positive, it doesn't seem directly relevant to the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHis job history is also worth considering. He has only held one job during the past year, which might suggest some instability or lack of responsibility. Wait a minute - could this be an indicator of potential difficulty in maintaining employment or building trust with employers? This is definitely something I should keep in mind as I evaluate his risk factors.\n\nIn terms of substance use and mental health, he has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. Let me check these findings again - yes, it seems that he has been abstaining from drug use and experiencing relatively stable mental health. This is a positive factor that could contribute to a lower risk assessment.\n\nNow, let's consider his living situation as a child. He lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. Hmm, this might suggest some level of exposure to potentially high-risk environments or behaviors during childhood. Let me think about how this could impact his current risk profile - while it's difficult to say for certain, it does raise concerns that he may have been exposed to situations that could influence his behavior as an adult.\n\nFinally, I'll examine his belief that \"God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\" This statement suggests a lack of spiritual or moral compass, which might be concerning. Let me think about how this factors into the risk assessment - while it's not directly relevant to potential criminal activity, it could indicate a higher likelihood of impulsive or reckless behavior.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I'm starting to get a sense of the person's overall risk profile. It seems that his history of arrests and convictions, lack of social support systems, and potential exposure to high-risk environments during childhood are all significant concerns. Let me think about how to quantify this - based on my analysis, I would predict that these factors indicate a high level of risk.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is that the given risk factors do indeed indicate high risk. I'm 85% confident in this assessment, considering the severity of his conviction record and the potential impact of his living situation during childhood.\n\nHere is my refined answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
