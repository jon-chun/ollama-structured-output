Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as mixed race. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
