The reasoning behind each factor's weight is detailed in the \"textual reasoning\" field. Factors such as age, previous arrests, drug use, and symptoms of depression are weighted higher due to their strong association with increased risk for recidivism. Education and employment history carry a lower weight because they can sometimes buffer against recidivism but need to be considered in the context of other risk factors. The prediction reflects the cumulative effect of these weighted risk factors.",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
