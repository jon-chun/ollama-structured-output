It predicts a moderate risk of rearrest within three years due to the person's youth and one arrest, with mitigating factors being stable living situation, education, no recent drug use, good mental health, and a supportive early environment. However, the confidence level is set at 65% because even with careful analysis, predicting human behavior remains inherently uncertain.",
