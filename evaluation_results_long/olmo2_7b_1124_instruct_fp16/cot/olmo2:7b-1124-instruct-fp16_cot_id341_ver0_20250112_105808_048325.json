The assessment concludes that the person has a moderate to high risk of rearrest within three years due to multiple arrests, substance abuse (cocaine use), and living alone which could potentially reduce social control. However, being young, unmarried, and without a college education, as well as not experiencing depression, introduces some mitigating factors that contribute to a moderate level of confidence in the prediction.",
