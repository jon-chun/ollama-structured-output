The confidence level is relatively low because I am only considering these specific risk factors, which may not present a complete picture. In a real-world situation, additional information would be necessary for a more accurate prediction. Additionally, it is essential to consider that statistical predictions can sometimes be wrong and should not replace professional judgement in the criminal justice system.",
