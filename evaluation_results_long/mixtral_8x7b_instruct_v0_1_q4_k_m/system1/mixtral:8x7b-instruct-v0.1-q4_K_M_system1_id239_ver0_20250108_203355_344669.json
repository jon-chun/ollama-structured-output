For example, while the individual has used marijuana in the past four years, they have not felt depressed recently. Additionally, their religious beliefs and current living situation are not typically considered risk factors. Therefore, I would rate my confidence as moderate (60 out of 100) in predicting that this individual presents a high risk for criminal behavior based on the provided information.",
