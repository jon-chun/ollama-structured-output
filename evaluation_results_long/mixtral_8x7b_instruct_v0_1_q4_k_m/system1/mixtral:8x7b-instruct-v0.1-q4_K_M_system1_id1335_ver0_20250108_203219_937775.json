These include young age, lack of education, unstable living situation, and recent drug use. However, it is important to note that risk assessments should always be considered alongside other information about the individual's circumstances and behavior. Additionally, the confidence level reflects a moderate degree of certainty based on the available data, but further evaluation and context would be necessary for a more accurate assessment.",
