These include having a high school diploma, stable employment history, no recent history of depression, and growing up in a two-parent household in a rural area. However, their past drug use and lack of social connections (being unmarried and living alone) might increase their risk slightly. It is essential to consider that this assessment is based on limited information and should not be used as the sole determinant for any decisions related to criminal justice outcomes.",
