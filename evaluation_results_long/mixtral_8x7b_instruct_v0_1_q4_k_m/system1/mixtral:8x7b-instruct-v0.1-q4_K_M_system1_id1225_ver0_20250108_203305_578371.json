These include his age (21 is relatively young to be considered a high risk), the fact that he has not used drugs or felt depressed recently, and his clear statement about his belief in God's role in his life. It's important to note, however, that risk assessments are never 100% accurate and should always be used in conjunction with other forms of assessment and judgement.",
