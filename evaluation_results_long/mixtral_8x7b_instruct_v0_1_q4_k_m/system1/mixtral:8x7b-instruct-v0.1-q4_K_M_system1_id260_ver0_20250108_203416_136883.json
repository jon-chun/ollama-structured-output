Additionally, the lack of a criminal record and stable living situation also suggest lower risk. However, given the young age and reported history of marijuana use and depression, continued monitoring may be warranted. It is important to note that this assessment is based on limited information provided and should not replace a comprehensive evaluation by a qualified professional.",
