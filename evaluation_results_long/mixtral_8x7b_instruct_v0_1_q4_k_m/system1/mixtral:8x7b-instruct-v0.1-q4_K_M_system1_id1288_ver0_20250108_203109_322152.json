Specifically, the individual's history of prior arrests and convictions, young age at first arrest, lack of stable employment, and history of drug use are all indicators of higher risk. However, there are also some protective factors present, such as the possession of a GED and a support system (i.e. family in an urban area). Therefore, while I would assess this individual as high-risk, it's important to consider these factors within the context of a comprehensive assessment that takes into account other relevant information.",
