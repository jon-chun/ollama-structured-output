The individual's young age and lack of criminal conviction suggest a lower likelihood of reoffending. Additionally, her educational pursuits, stable employment history, and support system (having lived with both biological parents) indicate positive factors that may reduce the risk of recidivism. However, continued monitoring for signs of depression or other behavioral changes would still be advisable.",
