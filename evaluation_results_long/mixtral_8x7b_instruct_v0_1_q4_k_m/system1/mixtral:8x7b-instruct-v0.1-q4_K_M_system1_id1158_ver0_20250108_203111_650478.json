These include having a high school diploma and being enrolled in higher education, maintaining employment, and not experiencing recent depression. However, it is important to note that the person has been arrested multiple times, which could indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. Additionally, substance use can also increase the risk of reoffending. A more comprehensive assessment would be needed to make a more accurate prediction.",
