These include:\n- Young age (22), male gender, and identifying as Black, which may expose him to systemic bias in the criminal justice system\n- Prior arrests and convictions\n- History of drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\n- Current mental health issues (\"he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up\")\n- Lack of educational attainment (no high school diploma or GED)\n- Unstable employment history (held 2 jobs during the year)\n- Prior childhood instability (lived with biological mother in a household of size 4 at a young age)\n\nHowever, there are also protective factors that may reduce his risk level, such as living alone (which could indicate stability and independence), and having religious or spiritual beliefs (he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally).\n\nOverall, while the individual's risk level cannot be determined with absolute certainty, there are enough potential risk factors to suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending. The confidence score of 72 reflects a moderate-to-high degree of certainty in this assessment based on the available information.",
