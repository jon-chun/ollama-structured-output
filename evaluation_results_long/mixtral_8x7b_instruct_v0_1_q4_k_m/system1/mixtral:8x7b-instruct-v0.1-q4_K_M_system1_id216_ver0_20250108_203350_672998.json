These elements may contribute to an increased likelihood of reoffending or engaging in criminal behavior. However, it is important to note that this prediction does not account for personal growth, support systems, or interventions that could mitigate these risk factors. The confidence level reflects a relatively high correlation with known risk factors but is not definitive and should be considered as part of a holistic assessment.",
