The lack of a high school diploma or GED is concerning, as is the transient nature of his employment. However, the absence of additional risk factors such as a history of violence, gang affiliation, or serious mental health issues leads me to believe that this individual presents a moderate to low risk at this time. It's important to note that any risk assessment should be regularly reevaluated and updated as new information becomes available.",
