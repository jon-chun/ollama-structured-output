These include stable housing, employment, no recent drug use or depression, and educational enrollment. The individual's belief in personal responsibility rather than attributing events to God may also indicate a level of self-awareness and motivation for positive change. However, it is important to note that risk assessments should be individualized and based on comprehensive evaluations, not solely on the factors provided.",
