For example, the individual has no criminal convictions and is currently living alone (which may indicate self-sufficiency). The fact that she identifies as Black should not be considered a risk factor, as race itself is not predictive of criminal behavior. Overall, while this person may still have some level of risk, I would rate it as low to moderate based on the information provided. However, a more comprehensive assessment should include an interview with the individual and further investigation into their background and circumstances.",
