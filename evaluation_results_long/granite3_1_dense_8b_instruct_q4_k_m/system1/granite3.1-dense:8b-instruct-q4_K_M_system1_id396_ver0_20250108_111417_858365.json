However, the individual's age (22), gender (female), and lack of prior convictions are generally associated with lower risk levels. Her current living situation (living alone) might suggest some degree of independence and self-sufficiency, which could also be a positive factor. The fact that she has held multiple jobs in the past year might indicate employability and stability.\n\nThe mention of feeling down for most of the past month suggests possible mental health issues, which could potentially increase risk levels. However, this information alone does not conclusively point towards high-risk behavior. Her religious beliefs (considering God has something to do with personal happenings) might indicate a sense of morality or ethics that could also work against higher risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential risk factors present, the absence of more serious criminal history and other high-risk behaviors suggest a lower risk level for this individual. The confidence level is set at 70 due to the presence of some concerning factors but overall mitigating circumstances.",
