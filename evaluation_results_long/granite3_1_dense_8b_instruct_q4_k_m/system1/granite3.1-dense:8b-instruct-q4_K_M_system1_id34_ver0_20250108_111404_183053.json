The individual's age (18), gender, ethnicity, and height/weight do not significantly contribute to an increased risk. Having been arrested and convicted twice is a concern, but the lack of further criminal activity in the past year is reassuring. His marital status, living arrangement, educational background, and employment history suggest stability. The absence of drug use and depression symptoms further reduces risk. Living in a larger family at a young age can indicate better social support. Lastly, his religious belief may contribute to a sense of personal responsibility and reduced likelihood of criminal behavior. However, the confidence level is not high due to the limited scope of information provided.",
