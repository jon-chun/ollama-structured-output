He also has a stable living situation and a high school diploma, which can indicate lower risk. However, his young age (21), previous arrests without conviction, and the size of his household during childhood could suggest higher risk. The fact that he believes in divine intervention might not be directly indicative of risk but could potentially influence behavior or attitudes related to criminal activity. Overall, based on the provided factors, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 75%.",
