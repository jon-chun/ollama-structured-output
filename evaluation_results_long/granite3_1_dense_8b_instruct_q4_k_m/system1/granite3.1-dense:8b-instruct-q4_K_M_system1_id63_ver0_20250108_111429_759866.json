    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons. Firstly, the individual's age (19) and gender (female) typically correlate with lower recidivism rates compared to other demographic groups. Secondly, she has only been arrested once and not convicted, suggesting minimal involvement in criminal activities. Her physical attributes are within average ranges. She is not married and does not live alone, but these factors are not significantly associated with high risk.\n\nHer educational background (lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate) and employment status (no jobs held in the past year) could potentially indicate higher risk, as unemployment and lower education levels are correlated with increased recidivism rates. However, her absence of drug use over the past four years and limited periods of severe depression during the past month suggest less likelihood of substance abuse or mental health issues driving criminal behavior.\n\nHer upbringing in a large family in an urban setting might indicate exposure to certain environmental risk factors, but her current religious beliefs could provide protective factors against criminal involvement. Overall, while there are some risk indicators, the absence of significant criminal history and presence of some mitigating factors lead to a low-risk assessment.",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 9, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
