Here's why:\n\n- Age (18) and gender (female) do not necessarily indicate high risk.\n- Having been arrested once does indicate some level of risky behavior, but only once is less concerning.\n- Having a job during the year indicates stability.\n- Current enrollment in college suggests future orientation and stability.\n- Living alone indicates self-sufficiency.\n- Her weight and height are within normal ranges, indicating good health.\n- She has not reported feeling depressed recently.\n- Living with both parents at a young age can indicate a stable upbringing.\n- Her religious beliefs may provide a positive influence on her life decisions.\n\nThe main factors that could be considered risky are past drug use and a relatively low educational level (high school diploma). However, these do not seem to be severe enough to classify this individual as high risk based on the provided information. The confidence level is moderate due to the limited number of high-risk indicators.",
