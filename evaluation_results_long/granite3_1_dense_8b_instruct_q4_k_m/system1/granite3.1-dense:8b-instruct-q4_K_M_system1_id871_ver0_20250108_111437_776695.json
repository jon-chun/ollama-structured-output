Living alone at her current age also indicates a lack of social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. The individual's rural upbringing in a household with both parents could potentially mitigate some risks, but the presence of additional high-risk factors outweighs this protective factor. Her belief that God has nothing to do with her personal circumstances may suggest a lack of spiritual support or coping mechanisms. Given these factors, the prediction is high risk with moderate confidence.",
