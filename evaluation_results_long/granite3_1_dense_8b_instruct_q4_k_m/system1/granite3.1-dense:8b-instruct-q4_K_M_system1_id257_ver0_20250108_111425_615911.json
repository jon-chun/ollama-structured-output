However, the individual's age (18), gender (female), and lack of prior convictions all suggest a lower risk level. Her enrollment in school and employment history also suggest stability and responsibility. The fact that she has never been married or lived alone could indicate a support system, which may act as a protective factor against criminal behavior. The size of her household at a young age might have been a factor contributing to instability, but her current living situation (alone) suggests adaptability and independence rather than ongoing risk factors. Her spiritual beliefs could potentially provide resilience and coping mechanisms. Despite these lower risk indicators, the recent drug use and depressive symptoms warrant caution, which is reflected in the moderate confidence level.",
