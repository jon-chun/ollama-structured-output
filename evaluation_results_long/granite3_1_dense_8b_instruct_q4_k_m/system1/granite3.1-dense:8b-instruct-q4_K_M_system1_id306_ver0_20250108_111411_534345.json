    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk level for several reasons. The individual's young age, lack of prior convictions, and enrollment in school suggest that they are likely engaged in prosocial activities. Living alone indicates some level of self-sufficiency and responsibility. Having only one job in the year suggests she is employable but not overly committed to work at the expense of other responsibilities.\n\nThe use of drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a concerning factor, as it could potentially indicate problematic behavior or substance abuse issues. However, the fact that she has not felt depressed over the past month suggests that these substance use behaviors are not indicative of a broader mental health issue at present.\n\nThe individual's family background - having lived with both parents in a household of five - suggests a stable upbringing. The size of her immediate social network (her household) also indicates some level of social integration, which can be protective against criminal behavior.\n\nHer religious beliefs or lack thereof do not appear to have a direct correlation with criminal behavior in this context.\n\nOverall, while the individual does present with some risk factors, they are outweighed by the prosocial indicators. Therefore, based on the information provided, she would be classified as a low risk. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based solely on the given data and real-world assessments involve more comprehensive evaluations.",
