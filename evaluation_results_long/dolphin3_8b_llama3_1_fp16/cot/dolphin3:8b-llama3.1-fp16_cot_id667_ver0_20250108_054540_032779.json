She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 110 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
