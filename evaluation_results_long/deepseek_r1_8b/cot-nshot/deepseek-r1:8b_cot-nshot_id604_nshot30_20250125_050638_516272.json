    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether this person is likely to be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of their characteristics one by one and see how they might contribute to that risk.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples given, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates, so I'll consider that as a medium factor because while it's a significant contributor, it's not the most direct cause on its own.\n\nNext, race. He's White. In the examples provided, both White and Black individuals had varying recidivism rates, but it doesn't seem to be a consistent indicator either way. So I'll assign this as low since race alone doesn't determine risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. From the examples, prior arrests seem to correlate with higher recidivism, so having an arrest record is medium in contributing to further rearrests.\n\nHis weight and height are 5'6\" and 202 lbs. Obesity is linked to higher criminal activity, so being overweight might be a high risk factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Single status and living alone can sometimes increase the likelihood of getting involved in criminal activities, especially due to social isolation or stress. This seems like a medium factor since it's related but not the most critical aspect.\n\nHaving only a GED certificate and not enrolled in college education is another factor. From examples, lacking higher education is often linked to higher recidivism rates, so this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe has held two jobs this year. Employment can be stabilizing, so having a job is good, but the number of jobs here is low, which might indicate underemployment or not enough stability. I'll consider that as medium since it's positive but not sufficient on its own.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a known risk factor for criminal behavior. The fact that he's currently feeling down also points to potential stress or instability. Both of these are high risk factors because they directly relate to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of size 10. Growing up in a large family might provide more support, but sometimes it can lead to different stresses like overcrowding or lack of resources. This is probably low since family structure alone isn't the most determining factor.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with his outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor, so this is good and might lower his risk compared to others without such beliefs. I'll assign this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest contributing factors are weight, drug use, feeling down, and education status. Each of these is significant, so I'll give them high weights. The other factors like age, race, arrest history, employment, and family background have medium or lower weights because while they contribute, they aren't as direct as the main ones.\n\nAdding all these weighted factors together, it's likely he has a higher risk of being rearrested in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Youthful age contributes to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone doesn't determine recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Previous arrest increases likelihood\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"high\", \"Obesity linked to higher criminal activity\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone can increase risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a known risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job stability is protective but not enough\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Current drug use and past use contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"mood\", \"high\", \"Feeling down indicates potential instability\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Large family can provide support or stress\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may lower risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
