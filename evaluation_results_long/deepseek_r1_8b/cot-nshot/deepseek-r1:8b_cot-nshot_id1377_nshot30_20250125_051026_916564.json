    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood that this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of her factors one by one and see how they stack up compared to the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Looking at the examples, younger individuals seem more likely to have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing better decision-making skills. But I don't know if this directly correlates or not. It might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, she's been arrested and convicted twice. In the examples, having prior arrests, especially convictions, was a significant factor leading to rearrest. For instance, some had 7 times or more, but even two seems concerning. So I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nHer weight is 148 lbs, which is on the lower side, but I don't see how that directly affects recidivism. Maybe it's low because it doesn't seem to contribute much to the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. In some examples, being part of a supportive family or relationship reduced risk, but here she's using drugs heavily, which might override that positive factor. So maybe this is a low risk factor for recidivism.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of criminal behavior because it limits employment opportunities and increases the chances of engaging in illegal activities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. Having steady employment can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior, so not having consistent work might be another high risk factor.\n\nShe's using cocaine regularly, which is a serious drug. The examples show that drug use significantly increases the risk of rearrest. Even though she hasn't used other drugs, cocaine alone is a strong indicator for high risk.\n\nShe's experiencing constant sadness and feeling down, which could be related to mental health issues. In some cases, mental health problems contribute to criminal behavior because individuals might turn to drugs or crime as coping mechanisms. So this is likely a medium risk factor.\n\nShe was raised in an urban area by her biological mother in a household of three. Growing up in an urban environment can expose one to more\u72af\u7f6a\u7684\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u800c\u5bb6\u5ead\u7ed3\u6784\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5979\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6709\u6bcd\u4eb2\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u5979\u73b0\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd2\u54c1\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\nPutting it all together, she has multiple high-risk factors: prior convictions, lack of education, drug use, and possibly mental health issues. The combination suggests a high likelihood of being rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning indicates younger age may pose higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_convictions\", \"high\", \"Prior arrests and convictions significantly increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight does not directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marital status alone does not determine recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No employment can increase vulnerability to criminal activities\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Regular cocaine use strongly linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues may contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban background and single-parent household pose moderate risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
