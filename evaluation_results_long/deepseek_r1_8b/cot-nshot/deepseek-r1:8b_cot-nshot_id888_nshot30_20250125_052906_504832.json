    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, the person in question is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. He's been arrested once and convicted. That's one arrest record, which might indicate some prior issues with the law. His physical stats are 5 feet 5 inches and 145 lbs\u2014so he's of average height and weight, nothing particularly stands out there.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might mean he has less support systems or more access to situations that could lead to recidivism. So that's something to consider.\n\nHis education level is another point: he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant predictor for future problems, including criminal behavior, as it limits job opportunities and can contribute to higher unemployment rates, which are linked to recidivism.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year, which is positive because having a job can provide structure and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So that's a protective factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is another positive sign. A history of drug use is often associated with higher recidivism rates, so his clean record here might lower the risk.\n\nHowever, he reports feeling down and dumps some of the time, indicating possible depression or emotional issues. Emotional instability can be a factor that increases the likelihood of criminal behavior as people might act out when dealing with mental health struggles.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a young child. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can expose individuals to higher levels of stressors and risks compared to other family structures, which may contribute to recidivism.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. That could be interpreted as a form of religious belief, but sometimes such strong beliefs can also be used as coping mechanisms, which might either help or hinder his behavior depending on the context.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, I notice that factors like prior convictions, lack of education, and drug use are consistently weighted as high risk. His current lack of education and past arrest align with these high-risk factors. His employment and clean drug record are low-risk factors, but his mental health and family background might offset some of those positives.\n\nSo, considering all this, the key high-risk factors here are his prior conviction and lack of education. The positive factors like employment and clean drug use are less significant in comparison. His emotional struggles and past living situation might add to the risk, but they aren't as severe as having a criminal history and no formal education.\n\nTherefore, I think there's a medium likelihood he'll be rearrested within three years. I'm not sure if it's higher or lower than average, but considering the high-risk factors, it leans towards the side of increased risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"A history of arrest and conviction is a strong indicator for future recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education increases the likelihood of criminal behavior due to limited opportunities\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs suggests positive engagement with societal roles reducing criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Clean drug history indicates lower probability of substance-related recidivism\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feelings of being down could contribute to behavioral issues but not as strongly as other factors\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a single-parent household in an urban area poses increased risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
