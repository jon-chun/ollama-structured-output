    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let's go through each of their characteristics one by one and assign a weight based on what I've learned from the previous examples.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is typically a time when people might have higher risk-taking behavior, so that's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White, but I'm not sure if race directly correlates with recidivism. From the examples, sometimes being Black was mentioned, but it didn't always lead to \"NO.\" Maybe race isn't a major factor here, so I'll consider it low or maybe medium. I think in this case, since it's just one aspect, I might assign it as low.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. From the examples, being arrested was sometimes a sign of higher risk (medium), especially if there were multiple arrests. But here, it's only once, so maybe medium? Or perhaps low because he hasn't been convicted yet.\n\nHis height is 6'4\" and weight is 157 lbs. Physical size can sometimes be a factor in how people behave or get into situations that lead to rearrest, but I'm not sure how significant this is. Maybe it's low or medium, depending on the other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently not living alone. Living arrangements can impact behavior. Being in a stable environment might reduce risk, so maybe this is a protective factor. So, perhaps that's a low or medium.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is often a significant factor. Lower education increases the likelihood of criminal behavior, so this could be a high risk factor.\n\nHe held 4 jobs during the year. Having employment can be stabilizing, but maybe not as much if it's only part-time or temporary. Still, having job stability might reduce recidivism, so maybe medium.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a high risk factor, especially if there's a history. Even though he's not currently depressed, substance abuse itself can lead to rearrests, so that's likely a high factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate better mental health. Mental health issues are linked to recidivism, so this could be a protective factor, maybe low or medium.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a rural area. Family structure can influence behavior. Being from a single-parent home might have some effects, but it's not as clear-cut. Maybe this is a medium factor.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity or faith can sometimes be protective against criminal behavior, so maybe this is a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risk factors seem to be education level and drug use, both likely high. The others are medium at best.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old, typical risk-taking behavior\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White identity may not directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Arrested once, but no conviction\"),\n    (\"physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight may influence behavior patterns\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, currently not living alone\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED increases risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held 4 jobs, indicating some job stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana recently, significant recidivism factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may indicate better mental health\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with mother in rural area, possible influence on behavior\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Faith may provide protection against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
