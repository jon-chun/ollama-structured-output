    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. I know that age can be a factor; younger people might have higher risk potential due to impulsivity. His arrest record shows he's been arrested once but not convicted. That's interesting because sometimes an arrest without a conviction doesn't indicate a strong criminal history.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 220 lbs. I'm not sure how physical build factors into risk, but maybe it relates to potential for violence or something else. His marital status is that he's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he has fewer checks in place, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having completed high school can sometimes indicate more stability, but not being in college could mean he doesn't have the same structure or support as someone who is enrolled. He's held 3 jobs in the year, which suggests some level of responsibility and income stability.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of recent drug use and mental health issues could reduce certain risks associated with substance abuse or mental instability.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable household might have provided him with better support systems, which can be protective factors against delinquent behavior.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That's a personal belief; I'm not sure how that directly affects risk but maybe it relates to his coping mechanisms or decision-making.\n\nPutting this together: He's young, hasn't been convicted, has some stability from living with parents and holding jobs, no recent drug use, and seems mentally stable. However, being arrested once without a conviction could indicate higher risk tendencies, even if he wasn't ultimately convicted. Plus, his age might make him more prone to impulsive behavior.\n\nI'm also considering that factors like living alone can be both protective (more privacy) or risky (less supervision). His job history is positive, which suggests he's responsible. But he hasn't been convicted, so maybe he's just lucky or hasn't had opportunities yet.\n\nHis religious beliefs might not directly correlate with risk but could influence his decision-making. Overall, while some factors lower the risk, others like a recent arrest without conviction and being young might increase it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
