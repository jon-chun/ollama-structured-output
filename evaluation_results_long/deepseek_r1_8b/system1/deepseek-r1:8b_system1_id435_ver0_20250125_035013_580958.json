    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which is relatively young. Younger individuals might have less experience with decision-making or be more impulsive, which can increase risks associated with criminal behavior. Also, he has been arrested nine times and convicted, indicating a history of involvement in the criminal justice system. Previous arrests and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. Not sure how much that contributes directly, but body size isn't typically a significant factor unless it relates to physical health or strength, which doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nHe hasn't married and is living alone. Living alone might mean he has more time and fewer responsibilities that could suppress criminal behavior, possibly increasing risk.\n\nHis education level: no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels are often linked to higher rates of criminal activity because it limits job opportunities and can lead to economic struggles, which are associated with crime.\n\nHe hasn't held a job in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for criminal behavior as it increases the likelihood of seeking alternative means of income through criminal activities.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed recently. Lack of recent drug use might reduce some risks, but if he has a history of substance abuse, that could still be relevant. Feeling not depressed now doesn't mean there's no history of mental health issues or other risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of 14 in an urban area. Growing up in a large, possibly chaotic family and in an urban environment can expose him to more crime and delinquent influences, which increases the risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but it's unclear how this specifically impacts criminal activity without more context.\n\nConsidering all these factors: arrest history, low education, unemployment, large family in urban area, young age, and some indicators like substance use in the past, I would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
