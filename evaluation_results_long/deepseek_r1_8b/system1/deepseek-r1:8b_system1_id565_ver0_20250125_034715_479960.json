    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high-risk individual based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk assessments, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A prior arrest could indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but without a conviction, it's not clear if she poses an immediate risk.\n\nHer physical description includes being 5 feet 4 inches and weighing 115 lbs. Physical build isn't typically a strong indicator of risk unless combined with other factors like past behavior.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might affect her social support network, which could be a risk factor, but it's not conclusive.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level doesn't directly correlate with criminal risk, though it can sometimes indicate stability or future potential.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year, indicating she's employed, which is generally a positive sign regarding financial stability and responsibility.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which suggests she's been clean for some time. However, she mentions feeling down \"so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up\" recently. This indicates possible mental health issues or emotional distress.\n\nShe comes from an urban area with both biological parents and a household of three. Growing up in a larger family in an urban setting can have various social and economic impacts, but it's not directly linked to criminal behavior unless combined with other factors.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal circumstances, which might indicate religious beliefs that could influence her actions or coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting this all together: she's young, has some indication of past legal trouble, is dealing with emotional distress, and is seeking higher education. However, there's no history of conviction, stable employment, and she's been clean for four years. These factors might lower the immediate risk compared to someone with a history of violence or more severe mental health issues.\n\nI'm leaning towards her not being a high-risk individual because the information provided doesn't point to significant red flags beyond minor concerns that don't typically predict higher criminality without additional context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
