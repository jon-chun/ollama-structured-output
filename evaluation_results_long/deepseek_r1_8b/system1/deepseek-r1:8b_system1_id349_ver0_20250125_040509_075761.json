    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That's not inherently a risk factor, but his age could be considered since younger people might have higher risk potential in certain contexts.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because a criminal history increases the likelihood of further issues. He's got at least one conviction on his record, which is a red flag for recidivism.\n\nHis physical stats: 6'0\" and 212 lbs. I don't see how that directly relates to risk factors unless it's about health, but it's not mentioned as an issue here. So maybe not relevant.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 22 isn't unusual, but could indicate some social isolation or lack of support systems, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. That shows he's motivated to further his education, which can be a protective factor against certain risks. So that's a positive sign.\n\nHe hasn't held a job in the past year. Unemployment can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors like drug use or criminal activity. His drug use is another point: he's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This mixed signal could mean he's using drugs without it affecting his mental state, which might lower the risk compared to someone using drugs for coping.\n\nHe lived with both parents in a household of six in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can sometimes lead to higher exposure to stressors or different social dynamics. But without more info on family issues or how he got along with his parents, it's hard to say.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be both protective and sometimes a source of coping, but if it's tied to higher risk behaviors, it might not directly indicate risk here.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a criminal history, which is a strong indicator. He's using drugs, which could contribute to further issues. However, his education and current enrollment might mitigate some risks. He hasn't been depressed recently, which suggests he's managing stress effectively or not facing significant mental health challenges currently.\n\nUnemployment could be a concern, but since he's in college, maybe he's temporarily unemployed or relying on savings. His social situation isn't particularly concerning beyond the fact that he lives alone, which is common for young adults.\n\nHis past arrest suggests he might have some issues with the law, but only one conviction. Without more info on the nature of that conviction, it's hard to gauge the severity. If it was a minor offense, it might not indicate high risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are some red flags like criminal history and drug use, there are also positive indicators like education enrollment and no current depression. It's a bit balanced. Without more details, it's tricky, but I'd lean towards higher risk given the arrest and drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
