    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this risk assessment. So, the user provided a scenario about a 22-year-old female and wants to determine if she poses a high risk based on certain factors.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given information:\n\n- Age: 22 years old.\n- Gender: Female, identifies as White.\n- Criminal history: Arrested once but not convicted. That's a point against her since an arrest can indicate potential criminal behavior, even if not convicted.\n- Physical stats: 5'7\" and 155 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is for risk assessment beyond maybe health or physical ability.\n- Marital status: Never married, living alone. Living alone might suggest she's managing on her own but could also be a factor in social circumstances.\n- Education: Completed Bachelor's degree, not enrolled in college. Higher education can sometimes correlate with lower criminality, but it's not determinative.\n- Employment: Held 4 jobs in the year. Stable employment is generally positive, indicating responsibility and structure.\n- Drug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent usage within the past month makes this more concerning as it suggests current engagement.\n- Mental state: Felt down for some months, nothing could cheer her up. This points towards possible mental health issues like depression or anxiety.\n- Family background: Grew up with both biological parents in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes be higher-crime areas, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nNow, considering the factors:\n\nArrest without conviction is a red flag. Drug use, especially recent use, is another concern. The mental health aspect could contribute to instability or poor decision-making. She has a stable job and education background, which are positive signs, but her current mental state might outweigh those positives in terms of risk.\n\nI need to evaluate how these factors stack up against each other. Criminal history is a significant indicator; an arrest indicates potential for further issues, even without a conviction. Drug use, especially recent, is a strong predictor of ongoing behavior that could lead to more serious offenses.\n\nHer mental health state might be a contributing factor leading to higher risk, as emotional instability can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. However, her stable employment and education suggest she has some structure in her life which might mitigate some risks.\n\nIn comparison, someone with similar factors but without recent drug use or mental health issues would likely have lower risk. But here, those elements are present, making the overall assessment higher.\n\nI should also consider if there's any information that could mitigate these risks. For example, her education and employment suggest she has resources. However, mental health issues can sometimes be addressed with treatment, but without knowing if she's seeking help, it's hard to say.\n\nIn risk assessments, each factor contributes to the overall score. Since each of these factors (criminal history, drug use, mental health) are significant individually, together they likely indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
