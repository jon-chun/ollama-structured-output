    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors for a person and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male identifying as Black. Being young and male can sometimes be associated with higher risk-taking behaviors. Also, being Black might have some historical context in terms of societal risks, but I should avoid stereotyping and look at individual factors.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two arrests, which isn't a lot, but the fact that he's been convicted suggests he has engaged in behavior that led to legal consequences. Prior convictions can be indicative of higher risk, especially if they're violent or repeat offenses.\n\nHis physical description: 5'11\" and between 200-224 lbs. That's considered overweight for his height, which might relate to health risks or possible substance abuse. Body weight can sometimes correlate with lifestyles that involve certain substances.\n\nHe hasn't married yet and is living alone. Living alone at 21 isn't unusual, but it could indicate he doesn't have a strong support system, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors if there's no one to check in on him or provide guidance.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant factor as it limits job opportunities and increases the chances of engaging in criminal activities due to fewer legitimate means of income. Unemployment is another risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which adds to his lack of stable income sources. Unstable employment or no employment can lead to financial stress, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors like theft or other crimes.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Recent substance use can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might mitigate some risks associated with drug use.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of 11. Growing up in a large family could mean exposure to different environments and possibly more stressors, but it's a bit vague without knowing the specifics of the household dynamics.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity or belief systems can influence behavior, but I'm not sure how this directly ties into risk assessment without more context on how his faith impacts his decisions.\n\nPutting this all together: He's got a history of arrest and conviction, lacks education and employment, uses substances, and has some demographic factors that could be linked to higher risks. However, the lack of current depression might reduce some factors. The combination suggests moderate risk, but without more specific information on the nature of his arrests or his mental state beyond depression, it's hard to say if it's high risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate to high risk because of the arrest history and lack of education/employment, but I need to assess confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
