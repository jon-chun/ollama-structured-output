    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk based on my expertise as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk due to impulsivity, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted, which suggests a history of criminal behavior. Prior convictions often correlate with increased risk, indicating potential for future offenses.\n\nHis physical description is 6 feet 0 inches and 170 lbs. While height and weight can vary widely, they don't provide significant indicators alone.\n\nMarital status and living situation: He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might not directly correlate with criminality but could be a factor in lifestyle choices that lead to risk.\n\nEducation level: He has a high school diploma, which is a positive indicator as education can deter criminal behavior. Not enrolled in college doesn't necessarily pose a high risk on its own.\n\nEmployment history: He's held two jobs this year, indicating responsibility and stability, which are protective factors.\n\nDrug use: He hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. However, he reported feeling down recently, which could relate to mental health issues that might increase risk.\n\nFamily background: Growing up in a household of four in an urban area with both biological parents. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and family structure influences resilience. Having both parents might provide some stability, but living in an urban area is a risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe God affects his personal life, which could be a protective factor or indicate a lack of spiritual support, potentially increasing risk if it contributes to poor decision-making.\n\nPutting this together, the key factors are the prior convictions and arrests. While other factors might mitigate some risk, the prior criminal history is a strong indicator that this person has demonstrated behavior that could lead to further criminal activity. The confidence in this prediction would be high based on statistical models that show a significant correlation between past offending and future behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
