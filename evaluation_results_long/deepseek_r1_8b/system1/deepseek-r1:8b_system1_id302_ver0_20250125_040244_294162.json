    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factor assessment for someone who's a 21-year-old female, White, and has been arrested once with a conviction. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's got an arrest record\u20141 time arrested and convicted. That's a red flag because it shows some history of lawbreaking or at least involvement in the criminal justice system. It might indicate higher risk factors.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and 135 lbs. Not sure how much body weight affects risk assessment, but maybe being underweight could be a stress indicator, which ties into other factors.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk because it may lead to social isolation or exposure to different environments that might increase criminal activity or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Not having further education could limit job opportunities, which can contribute to economic stressors. Economic hardship is often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs in the year, so she does have some work experience. Employment can be stabilizing, but if she's only done part-time or temporary jobs, that might not provide enough stability.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Past drug use is a concern, especially if it's recent. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which can co-occur with substance abuse, increasing overall risk.\n\nShe grew up in a household of 5 with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences. Growing up in a large family might mean she experienced some neglect or had access to poor role models.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God has something to do with her personal life. Religion can influence behavior, sometimes positively (like higher adherence to rules) or negatively if it's used as justification for actions.\n\nPutting this all together: Arrest history is a strong indicator. She's using drugs recently, which adds another layer of risk. Economic status without further education and living alone could contribute to stressors that lead to recidivism. The urban upbringing also increases exposure to potential criminal influences. Her belief system might influence her decision-making but it's unclear if it's protective or another factor.\n\nI think the factors point towards higher risk, but I'm not sure about the exact confidence level. Maybe around 70-80% because while there are several red flags, some could be mitigated by current employment and no recent charges beyond the one arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
