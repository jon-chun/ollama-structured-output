    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor that might be relevant, but alone it's not conclusive. There are people from all backgrounds who don't engage in criminal activity.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. This suggests he's had interactions with the legal system before, which could indicate higher risk factors like poor decision-making or impulsive behavior. However, since there are no convictions, it's not certain.\n\nHe\u2019s 7 feet 3 inches and 140 lbs, but I don't think physical stature plays a significant role in assessing criminal risk. It's more about behavior and choices rather than size.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t been married and is living alone. While living alone might mean he has more independence, it could also lead to isolation or making poorer decisions without accountability. However, this isn't directly indicative of criminality on its own.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor because it may limit job opportunities and contribute to higher unemployment rates, which are linked to criminal behavior in some cases. This could make him more vulnerable to engaging in illegal activities.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. employment might indicate some level of responsibility or structure in his life, which could be a protective factor. It suggests he's capable of holding down work, which might reduce criminal tendencies.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor associated with higher likelihood of criminal behavior. However, not using drugs recently (as he hasn't felt depressed in the past month) might indicate he's moving away from substance abuse. Still, the fact that he used marijuana recently is concerning.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t feel depressed over the past month, which could mean he's functioning better mentally. Depression can sometimes be a factor contributing to criminal behavior, so his current mental state might be protective against it at this time.\n\nAt 19, he lived with his biological dad in an urban area as part of a household of five. Growing up in a larger family, especially in an urban environment, can have various influences. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and family dynamics could contribute to either positive or negative outcomes. However, without more details on the family's behavior, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which might indicate a lack of religious beliefs. While some studies suggest that religious beliefs can be protective against criminal behavior, having no such beliefs doesn't automatically make someone a higher risk.\n\nPutting this all together: arrests without convictions, past drug use, lack of education, and living in an urban area are concerning factors. However, his current mental state is positive, he's employed, and he hasn't been convicted despite prior arrests. These could indicate that he's turning things around or has better self-regulation now.\n\nI'm a bit torn because while there are clear risk factors like drug use and lack of education, the lack of recent negative behavior and some protective factors might mean the overall risk isn't as high as it could be. It's possible he's making positive changes, but it's also possible he could relapse or make poor decisions again.\n\nI think I need to weigh these factors carefully. The confidence is about 70% because there are definite red flags, but his recent stability might mitigate some of that risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
