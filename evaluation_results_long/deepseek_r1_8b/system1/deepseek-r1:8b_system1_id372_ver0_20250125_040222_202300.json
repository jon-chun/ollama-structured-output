    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female, which is pretty young. Younger individuals might have higher risk factors due to impulsivity and less experience in making good decisions. She identifies as White, but that doesn't directly relate to risk assessment unless there are specific demographic considerations, which I don't see here.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant red flag because a history of criminal behavior suggests she might continue or escalate her actions. Arrests and convictions indicate prior conduct that could be predictive of future behavior.\n\nHer physical description includes being 5'4\" and between 150-174 lbs. While body weight can vary, it doesn't directly correlate with risk in this context unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or criminal history.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she has fewer supports, which could increase risks if she's dealing with emotional or mental health issues.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college is another concern. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and contribute to socioeconomic stressors, which might be linked to higher risk behaviors like substance abuse or criminal activity.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Recent use (within the past month) of these substances, especially cocaine, is concerning because it's a more potent and addictive drug. The fact that she feels \"so down in the dumps\" all the time suggests she might be experiencing significant emotional distress or mental health issues.\n\nShe comes from a household with her biological dad where there were four people. I don't have information on whether that household had criminal history, but living in a large family could provide more chaotic environments that contribute to higher risks.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with her life, which might indicate she lacks a support system or belief system that could help her navigate tough times, possibly leading to higher risk behaviors as she seeks alternative coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions, recent drug use, emotional distress, lack of education, and possible isolation from living alone. These factors are interconnected and suggest a high likelihood of continuing risky behavior or reoffending. The combination is strong enough that I would lean towards a \"YES\" prediction with a high confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
