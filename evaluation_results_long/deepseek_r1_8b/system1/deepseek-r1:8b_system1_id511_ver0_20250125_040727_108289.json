    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high-risk individual based on the given risk factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's a demographic factor that might influence risk assessment, but I need more context. Being young and male could be a risk factor in certain contexts, like higher propensity for certain behaviors, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. An arrest and conviction are strong indicators of past risky behavior, so this is a red flag. It suggests he has engaged in illegal activities before, which could mean higher risk again in the future.\n\nHis physical description includes being 6 feet 0 inches and weighing 165 lbs. Not sure how much this contributes to risk assessment, but sometimes physical size can be a factor in certain crimes, though it's not directly related here.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might increase risk factors like substance abuse because there's no one around to check in on him or monitor his behavior. Being single could also mean he has more time and opportunity for risky activities.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level can influence risk factors; higher education often correlates with lower criminal activity, but he might still be at risk if other factors are present. He's working three jobs, which indicates responsibility and structure, possibly reducing some risks.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down during the past month. Drug use is a significant risk factor. The fact that he used marijuana recently could point to higher risk. Feeling down or having mood issues might indicate stress or emotional instability, which can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of three. Growing up in a stable family environment is generally protective against crime and delinquency. However, his current situation includes living alone, which might not provide the same level of support.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor, as it often correlates with lower criminal activity. But if his belief system isn't providing enough structure or support, it might not counterbalance other risk factors.\n\nPutting this all together: he's had contact with the criminal justice system, has a history of drug use, is currently feeling down, and lives alone without a stable family structure. These elements suggest higher risk compared to someone without these factors. However, his education and employment are positive indicators that might mitigate some risks. But the combination of arrest, substance abuse, and mood issues likely outweighs those positives.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the prediction should be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
