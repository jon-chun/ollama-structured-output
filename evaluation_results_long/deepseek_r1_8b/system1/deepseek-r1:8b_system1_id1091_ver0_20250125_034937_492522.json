    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The user provided a detailed scenario about a person and wants me to assess if the given risk factors indicate a high risk using only a JSON response.\n\nFirst, I need to identify each risk factor:\n\n1. **Demographics**: 22-year-old male, identifies as Black. Age can be a factor, but younger adults might have more opportunities for change.\n2. **Criminal History**: 7 arrests and at least one conviction. Multiple arrests suggest higher risk, especially if previous convictions are for violent or serious offenses.\n3. **Physical Description**: 5'11\" and between 150-174 lbs. Not directly a risk factor but could relate to health if combined with drug use.\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Never married, living alone. Solitary living might increase risks like substance abuse or antisocial behavior.\n5. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education can hinder employment and socioeconomic factors.\n6. **Employment Status**: No jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a stressor linked to higher criminal activity.\n7. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years, felt down in the past month. Current mental health struggles could indicate higher risk of recidivism.\n8. **Early Environment**: Lived with biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences.\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Doesn't believe God affects his life personally, which might indicate a lack of support system or moral anchors.\n\nPutting it all together: Criminal history is significant\u20147 arrests suggest persistence. Unemployment and low education increase risks. Current drug use and mental health issues (feeling down) are concerning. Growing up in an urban environment with a large household could mean exposure to crime. No religious beliefs might mean fewer support systems.\n\nConsidering these, the risk factors point towards a high likelihood of further criminal activity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
