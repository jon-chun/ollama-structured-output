    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for someone and determine if they pose a high risk based on the given criteria. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. That's straightforward demographic info. Age-wise, she's in her early twenties, which could be a factor depending on the context, like if she's more likely to engage in certain behaviors due to youth or immaturity.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because criminal history is often indicative of higher risk factors. Being arrested and having a conviction suggests she has at least one run-in with the law, which could mean she's involved in higher-risk activities or has a history that might repeat.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'7\" and between 200-224 lbs. That's on the heavier side for her height, so she might be categorized as overweight or obese. Health issues related to weight can sometimes contribute to risk factors, though it's not directly a criminal justice risk but could impact behavior or decisions.\n\nShe hasn't married and is living alone. Living alone at 20 might indicate she doesn't have a strong support network, which could lead to higher risk behaviors as she might struggle with self-control or decision-making without the support of family or others.\n\nEducation-wise, she lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Low education levels are often linked to higher rates of criminal activity because it limits employment opportunities and can increase stressors that lead to negative behaviors.\n\nShe's held one job during the year, which is better than none but still shows limited employment history. Stable work might indicate some structure in her life, but having only one job could mean she's vulnerable if that job is unstable or if she faces financial difficulties.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Current drug use, especially of harder drugs like cocaine, is a significant risk factor for criminal activity. Drug abuse can lead to higher likelihoods of theft, violence, or other illegal activities.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While depression isn't directly a crime indicator, it's a mental health factor that could either increase or decrease risk depending on her coping mechanisms and behavior. If she's not currently struggling with mental health issues, it might lower some risks but her past drug use is more concerning.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a large household in an urban environment can expose her to different stressors or influences, which may have contributed to her current situation.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with what happens personally could indicate a sense of control or divine intervention, which might influence her decision-making or behavior in ways that could be risky.\n\nPutting it all together: Criminal history is a strong indicator. Her drug use, particularly cocaine, adds to the risk. Limited education and employment might contribute to economic stressors. Living alone without support and limited social ties can increase vulnerability. She doesn't show signs of current depression, which might reduce some factors but her past behavior is concerning.\n\nI need to assess if these factors collectively indicate a high risk. Criminal history and drug use are significant predictors of recidivism. The lack of education and employment could point towards economic hardship leading to criminal activities for survival or other reasons. Living alone without support can lead to isolation, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nSo, considering all these points, it seems like she meets several high-risk factors. Therefore, the prediction should be YES with a confidence around 80% because while some factors may mitigate others (like no current depression), the presence of criminal history and drug use heavily influences the assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
