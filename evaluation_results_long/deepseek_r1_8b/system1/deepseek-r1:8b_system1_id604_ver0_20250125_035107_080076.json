    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person poses a high risk based on the given factors. Let me start by breaking down each point.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor but doesn't inherently indicate high risk on its own. Young males can have various behaviors, both low and high risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction is a bit concerning because it shows he's had some interaction with the law, but it doesn't mean he's a high risk yet. People can be arrested without being charged or convicted.\n\nHis physical stats: 5'6\" and 200 lbs. That's on the taller side for someone who's heavyset. Not sure how that ties into risk assessment beyond perhaps health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate he's independent, but it could also mean he lacks support systems, which sometimes ties into higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED is equivalent to a high school diploma, so he has some education but isn't pursuing further studies. This could be a stability factor or indicate he's not seeking more education, which might relate to higher risk if he's looking for something else.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the year. That shows he's employed, which is a positive sign as it suggests he has income and structure.\n\nHis drug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Some use is minor, but given that he felt down in the dumps recently, maybe more concerning. The fact that he feels down could be a sign of mental health issues, which might increase risk depending on other factors.\n\nHe comes from a big household where both parents were present. That's a stable upbringing, which can be protective against some risks.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That could indicate he has strong beliefs or faith, which can be a protective factor in managing stress and decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together: He has an arrest history without conviction, uses marijuana, feels down, but has employment and a stable upbringing. The key points are the arrest and drug use. Arrests alone don't always mean high risk, especially without a conviction, but combined with drug use, which can sometimes be a precursor to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHis mental state could be a factor. If he's feeling down, it might indicate potential for higher risk behaviors like substance abuse or other issues. His employment suggests he's functioning well in that area, so maybe the risk isn't as high.\n\nAlso, his belief in God might help him cope with stress. So, even though he has some concerning factors, they don't all point to high risk without more information.\n\nI'm a bit torn because on one hand, there are signs of possible issues (arrest, drug use, low mood), but on the other, positive factors like employment and stable upbringing might mitigate that risk. Without more severe issues or a history of higher-risk behavior, it's hard to say he's high risk.\n\nSo maybe his risk isn't as high as someone who has multiple prior convictions, severe mental health issues, or a history of violent behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 10. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
