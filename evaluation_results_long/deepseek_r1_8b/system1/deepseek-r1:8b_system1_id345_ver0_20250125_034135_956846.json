    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 20-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is White and identifies as such. That's straightforward demographic info. Next, he has been arrested once and convicted, which suggests some criminal history. His height and weight are average, not particularly concerning.\n\nHe hasn't married yet and lives alone, which could indicate independence or possible social isolation but isn't inherently risky on its own. He has a high school diploma and is not in college, which is common, especially for someone his age. Having held four jobs shows responsibility and some stability, though job history can sometimes correlate with lower risk if the person is working legally.\n\nHis past drug use of marijuana within the last four years could be concerning, as substance abuse is a known risk factor. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate he's currently in a stable mental state. He grew up in a rural area with both biological parents, living in a household of four. That's a stable family background, which can be protective against some risks.\n\nReligiously, he believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. This could mean he has a strong moral framework or social support from religious communities, which might lower risk factors associated with criminal behavior, like substance abuse or antisocial behavior.\n\nConsidering all these points, the presence of criminal history and past drug use are significant red flags, but the lack of current depression, stable family background, and some responsibility (jobs) might mitigate those risks. However, given that he has been convicted, which is more concerning than just an arrest, I'm leaning towards a higher risk. The fact that he's using substances recently adds to it.\n\nI also need to think about how these factors interact. His criminal history suggests he's had some interaction with the legal system, possibly leading to further issues if not addressed. However, his current lack of depression might mean he's not experiencing the emotional instability that often accompanies substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nIn risk assessment, it's also important to consider protective factors. His stable family and employment indicate he has some structure in his life, which can be protective. But his drug use is a significant concern, especially if it's recent, as it can lead to more severe issues like addiction or criminal behavior.\n\nSo weighing these, I think the factors point towards a higher risk, but not extremely high because of the presence of mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
