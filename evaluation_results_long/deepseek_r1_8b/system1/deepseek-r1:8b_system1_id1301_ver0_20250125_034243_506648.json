    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female, Black identity. That's a demographic factor that can be associated with higher risks in some contexts, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Having a criminal history does increase the risk assessment, especially if there are prior convictions that indicate more serious offenses.\n\nHer physical description: 5'1\" and 135 lbs. Not sure how this ties into risk factors directly unless considering possible vulnerabilities, but it's minor here.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at a young age can sometimes be a red flag for certain behaviors or situations where she might be more exposed to risks.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education can contribute to higher risk if it's linked to unemployment or other negative outcomes.\n\nShe has held 2 jobs this year. employment indicates some structure, which could be a protective factor, but it's limited to two jobs and she may not have a stable income.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use is a risk factor, especially if there's a history of substance abuse leading to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, particularly in an urban setting, can have various influences, both positive and negative.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal circumstances. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor or may influence behavior in different ways depending on the context.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a criminal history, which is significant. She's young and hasn't completed education, possibly leading to economic challenges. She's held jobs but not necessarily stable ones. Her past drug use could indicate higher risk behaviors. Living alone might mean less supervision or support. The household background in an urban area adds context that might relate to higher crime rates.\n\nHowever, her current lack of depression and recent job holding might mitigate some risks. Still, the criminal history is a strong indicator. Considering all factors, it's likely she poses a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
