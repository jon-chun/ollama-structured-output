    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old female over the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a history of being arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That could be seen as a low indicator because not having a criminal record might suggest lower involvement in further criminal activities. But on the other hand, an arrest can sometimes lead to more engagement if there's a pending case or if she feels targeted by the system.\n\nShe identifies herself as Black. Racial factors in the U.S. justice system are complex. Studies show that Black individuals are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement, so this could be a medium risk factor because of the higher likelihood of future interactions with the criminal justice system.\n\nHer weight is 230 lbs and height is 5'3\". While obesity itself isn't directly tied to recidivism, being overweight can sometimes correlate with socioeconomic factors that might increase risk. I think this would be a low factor because physical health alone doesn't predict rearrest.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean she lacks the structure and supervision that a household might provide. This is often associated with higher recidivism rates, so this seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not being in education or employment can increase downtime, which might lead to criminal activities. This could be a medium risk because lack of productive engagement can contribute to delinquency.\n\nShe hasn't held a job in the past year, similar to the previous point. Unemployment is a known predictor of recidivism, so this would also be a medium factor.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Drug use itself isn't always a strong indicator unless it's frequent or combined with other factors like criminal history or socioeconomic issues. Her recent emotional state might indicate stress or instability that could lead to recidivism, so this is a medium risk.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a large household in a rural area as a child. Growing up in a chaotic or neglectful environment increases the likelihood of future antisocial behavior. This seems like a high risk factor because it directly ties to adverse childhood experiences that are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHer lack of religious belief is also noted. Some studies suggest that spiritual beliefs can be protective against delinquency, so not having such beliefs might increase risk. This would be a medium factor.\n\nPutting all these together: prior arrest (low), race (medium), weight (low), living alone (medium), education status (medium), unemployment (medium), substance use (medium), childhood environment (high), and lack of belief in God (medium). The highest weighted factor is her upbringing, which is a significant influence. The next highest are the socioeconomic factors like unemployment and lack of education.\n\nSo, considering all these, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" with high confidence because the combination of adverse factors outweighs the lower ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"Based on her one arrest without conviction, she may not have a strong criminal history\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals in the U.S. often face higher risk of justice system involvement\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Obesity is not directly tied to recidivism but can correlate with socioeconomic factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of supervision or support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Not being enrolled in college can increase downtime and criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of employment can lead to higher risk of delinquency\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use and mood issues may indicate higher risk behaviors\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"high\", \"Adverse childhood environment strongly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God can reduce protective factors against delinquency\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
