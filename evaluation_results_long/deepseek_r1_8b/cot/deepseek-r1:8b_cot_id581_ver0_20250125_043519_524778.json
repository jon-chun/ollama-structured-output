    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk factors for this individual's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information given and see what it implies.\n\nFirst off, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Her criminal history is minimal\u2014she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might lower her risk compared to someone with a history of convictions, but I can't ignore that one arrest either. It shows some involvement with the justice system, even if it didn't result in a conviction.\n\nHer physical description includes being 5'3\" and between 150-174 lbs. Not sure how much height or weight plays into criminal risk directly, but maybe being in that range could affect things like job opportunities or mental health, which might indirectly influence recidivism.\n\nShe's never been married and is not living alone. That means she has some social support, possibly from family or friends. Living with others can provide a sense of stability, which might reduce the chances of getting into trouble again.\n\nShe holds a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is a positive factor as it indicates some educational achievement. Not being in college could mean she's not pursuing further education, but having a job might indicate she's stable enough.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a good sign because drug use is often linked to criminal behavior. However, she did feel down during the past month, indicating some level of emotional distress. That could be a risk factor because mental health issues can contribute to recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment might expose her to more stressors or higher crime rates. The family structure\u2014just her and her mom\u2014is different from single-parent households, but it's still a factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal circumstances. That could indicate she has strong religious beliefs, which might provide her with coping mechanisms or support networks that reduce her risk.\n\nPutting this all together: She doesn't have a criminal history beyond an arrest, has some social support, is stable financially with employment, has a GED, hasn't used drugs recently, and has some emotional support. These factors seem to lower her risk compared to someone with more red flags.\n\nSo, considering each factor:\n\n- Criminal History: Low (only one arrest)\n- Employment: High (four jobs show stability)\n- Education: Medium+ (GED is good, not in college might be neutral or slightly low)\n- Mental Health: Medium (depressed feelings could be a risk)\n- Family/Support: Medium (living with others is positive, but urban background is neutral)\n\nI think the overall risk is medium. She doesn't have the highest risk factors like prior convictions or significant criminal history, but she's not completely clean either\u2014there was an arrest and some emotional issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"She has only been arrested once and not convicted, indicating minimal involvement with the justice system\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Four jobs in a year show stability and financial responsibility\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED certificate shows educational achievement but not pursuing higher education may limit future opportunities\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down during the past month could indicate stress or emotional instability which might increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"medium\", \"Living with others provides some social support, though urban upbringing adds context that might influence behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.
