    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this person's risk factors for rearrest within three years. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. I don't know if age itself is a strong indicator of recidivism, but being 18 might make her more susceptible because it's a younger age where impulsive decisions are common. But without more info on how other factors interact, I'm not sure.\n\nShe hasn't been convicted despite one arrest. That could mean she was arrested for something minor or that the charges didn't stick. If she's not a repeat offender, maybe her risk is lower compared to someone with a history of convictions.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 130 lbs. I don't see an obvious connection between body size and criminal behavior, so probably low here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone might mean she has more access to opportunities for bad decisions, but it could also mean she's more independent. It's a bit of a neutral factor.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is positive. Education can be a strong protective factor against criminal behavior. So this should be medium to high.\n\nShe has held three jobs in the year. Employment is another good sign; it indicates responsibility and structure, so that's probably medium to high as well.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use could increase her risk of rearrest, especially if she continues using or if she's involved with a criminal network. She also mentioned feeling down recently, which might relate to substance abuse or other mental health issues. This seems significant, so high weight.\n\nShe was raised in an urban area by her biological dad in a household of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences. Being part of a larger family might provide more support, but if the family isn't involved positively, it could be risky. So medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God involved in her life. Religion can offer coping mechanisms and moral guidance, which are protective factors. This should be low to medium.\n\nShe's 18, so younger age is a risk factor because she might have less decision-making experience. But without more info on past behavior beyond an arrest, it's hard to assess.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think her drug use is the highest risk factor. School and employment are positive but might not outweigh the negative of drug use. Urban background is medium, and religion is low.\n\nSo factors from high to low: Drug Use (high), Age (medium), Employment (medium), Urban (medium), Religion (low), Living Alone (maybe low?), Education (medium). Wait, she's living alone now but was in a household before. Maybe that's more of a current situation, so it might be medium.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to assign each:\n\n- Drug Use: High\n- Age: Medium\n- Employment: Medium\n- Urban Background: Medium\n- School Enrollment: Medium (positive)\n- Religion: Low\n- No Marital Status: Maybe low or medium? Not sure.\n- Living Alone: Could be medium because it might mean she's more independent but also potentially more exposed.\n\nBut the instructions say to assign each factor a weight. So I'll list them as:\n\n1. Drug Use (High)\n2. Age (Medium)\n3. Employment (Medium)\n4. Urban Background (Medium)\n5. School Enrollment (Medium)\n6. Religion (Low)\n7. Living Alone (Medium)\n8. No Marital Status: Maybe low.\n\nWait, but in the initial analysis, I might have missed some factors. Let me make sure I include all provided info.\n\nShe has never been married\u2014could be a factor, possibly medium if it's about social support.\n\nBut overall, drug use is the biggest risk here. So confidence would be high that she has a higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent drug use and feelings of despair indicate higher likelihood\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Young age may increase risk due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Employment indicates structure but not necessarily enough alone\"),\n    (\"urban_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Urban environment can expose to more criminal influences\"),\n    (\"school_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Education is protective but effect may vary\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Religious beliefs offer moral guidance\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No marriage might not significantly affect risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Independence can lead to exposure\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
