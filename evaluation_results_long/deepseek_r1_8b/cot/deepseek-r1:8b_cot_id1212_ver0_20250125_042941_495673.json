    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. I know that age can be a factor\u2014youthful offenders sometimes have higher recidivism rates. But his race is often correlated with higher arrest rates, so that might tip the scale towards higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's not great. Being arrested before could indicate some criminal history or tendencies. His current situation: he lives alone, doesn't work, and hasn't held a job in a year. Unemployment can be a stressor and may contribute to criminal behavior as a form of coping mechanism.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED, which is a big red flag. Lower education levels are linked to higher recidivism because it limits employment opportunities and life skills. Plus, he's not in college, so there's no positive progression path.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years but was feeling pretty down recently. The mental state is crucial\u2014if someone is struggling mentally, they might be more susceptible to criminal behavior as a way to cope with their emotions.\n\nHis upbringing was tough: lived with his mother in a household of six in an urban area. Growing up in a large, possibly chaotic family can lead to exposure to crime and delinquent influences. Urban environments themselves have higher crime rates, so that adds another layer.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or religion. I'm not sure how that ties in, but sometimes people turn to religion for support, and without that, they might feel more lost or disconnected.\n\nPutting it all together: he has a history of arrest, lacks education, is unemployed, feels down, grew up in a high-crime environment, and has struggled with coping mechanisms. Each of these factors seems to contribute to a higher risk. I think the strongest factors are his criminal history, unemployment, lack of education, and tough upbringing. These probably weigh more than his mental state or lack of drug use. So I'd assign high weights to those factors. Based on that assessment, I'm leaning towards predicting he will be rearrested within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"young age may contribute to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"higher arrest rates for Black individuals often correlated with race\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"prior arrest and conviction indicate potential for further behavior\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"lack of employment can lead to criminal activity as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"no high school diploma limits life opportunities and increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"current feelings of despair may increase likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family\u80cc\u666f\", \"high\", \"upbringing in large, possibly chaotic household raises exposure to crime\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"disconnection from religious support may contribute to felt isolation\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
