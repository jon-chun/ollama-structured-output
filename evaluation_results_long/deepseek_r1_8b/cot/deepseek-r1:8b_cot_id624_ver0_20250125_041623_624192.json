    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person being rearrested within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which is pretty young. Research shows that younger people are more likely to reoffend because they might have less experience with the consequences of their actions and may not have developed better decision-making skills yet. So I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's Hispanic and identifies as such. Studies show that being Hispanic can sometimes be a risk factor for recidivism, but it can also vary based on other factors like socioeconomic status or whether they're part of a gang. Since there's no info about those, I'm a bit unsure. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe has six arrests but no convictions. This is concerning because it shows he's been involved in the criminal justice system multiple times without being held accountable. It could indicate a pattern of behavior that's likely to continue if not addressed. So this factor is probably high risk.\n\nHis physical description: 5'11\" and 165 lbs. Not sure how much weight plays into recidivism, but being under or overweight can sometimes be associated with higher risk factors, maybe due to health issues affecting decisions. But without more info, I'll consider it low or medium. Maybe medium because it might relate to substance abuse.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at a young age could mean he doesn't have the support of a family or significant others, which can increase risk by making it harder to stay out of trouble. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big red flag for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and increases the chances of getting involved in criminal activities. Definitely a high risk here.\n\nHe's held no jobs in the past year. Unemployment, especially at a young age, can lead to boredom or financial stress, which might drive someone towards criminal behavior. This is another high factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a indicator of recidivism, but if he's been using recently and hasn't faced consequences, it could mean he's not taking his substance abuse seriously. This might increase his risk, so probably medium to high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While depression can be linked to criminal behavior, it's speculative without knowing more about his history or treatment. Maybe low or medium, but since I don't know, I'll tentatively say medium.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a large household in a rural area. Growing up in a big family might provide better support or more supervision, which can lower the risk. So this is likely a low factor.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his life personally. Religiosity can influence behavior; those without strong faith might have lower inhibitions against crime. This could be a high risk because without belief in consequences from a higher power, he might not feel as deterred.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are age, past arrests, lack of education, unemployment, recent substance use, and his worldview regarding religion. These seem to heavily influence recidivism risk. So I'm leaning towards high confidence in a prediction of \"YES.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age is often associated with higher recidivism rates due to lack of experience and decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic individuals may have higher recidivism risks, though this can vary based on other factors\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Six arrests without conviction indicate a pattern of behavior likely to continue if unaddressed\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"medium\", \"Underweight or overweight status can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone at a young age may increase risk due to lack of support and supervision\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong indicator for recidivism as it limits job opportunities and increases criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment, especially at a young age, can lead to boredom or stress, increasing criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use without consequences may indicate poor decision-making and higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression indicates no direct link, though history could influence risk differently\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a large family with both parents might provide better support, lowering risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Lack of belief in a higher power may reduce inhibitions against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
