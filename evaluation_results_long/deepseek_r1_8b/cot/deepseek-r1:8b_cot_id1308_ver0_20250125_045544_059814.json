    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person and predict if they'll be rearrested within three years. Let's go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's a demographic factor. I know that being a young male can contribute to higher risk due to age-related impulsivity. Being Black might also have some socio-economic factors involved, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted, so he already has a criminal history. That\u2019s definitely a high risk factor because prior convictions indicate a pattern that's not new. \n\nHis physical description is 5'9\" and 145 lbs. I don't have specific info on how this relates to criminal behavior, but being of average build might not be as relevant as other factors.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t married and lives alone. Living alone could mean he lacks supervision or support, which might increase risk. Not having a high school diploma or GED suggests he might have fewer resources and opportunities, contributing to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe\u2019s unemployed, which is another red flag because job instability can lead to financial stressors that may drive criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. But his mental state\u2014he feels down a lot\u2014could be a risk factor. Depression or emotional instability can sometimes lead to impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a big household in an urban area with his biological mother. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. A large family might not have provided the necessary support, contributing to his current situation.\n\nReligiously, he believes God has something to do with his life. That could be either positive or negative; sometimes religion can be a source of support, but if it's tied to justification of actions, it might pose risks.\n\nPutting this all together: Criminal history is high, lack of education and employment are medium-high, living situation and mental state add another layer, family background is medium. Demographics like age and race also contribute.\n\nSo the prediction leans towards \"YES\" with a confidence around 70-80% because while he's showing positive signs (no recent drug use), his criminal history, lack of support systems, and other risk factors make rearrest likely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"high\", \"Young male, Black identity; socio-economic factors\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Arrests and convictions indicate established pattern\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of job stability increases risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"No diploma/GED may limit resources\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feelings of low mood could lead to impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing without strong support system\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may be neutral or positive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
