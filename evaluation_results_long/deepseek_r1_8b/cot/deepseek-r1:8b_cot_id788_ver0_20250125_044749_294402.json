    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of this 21-year-old White male being rearrested within the next three years. He has two arrests and convictions, which is a significant factor. His age might work in his favor since younger people often have less criminal history, but he's been arrested twice already.\n\nHe lives alone and hasn't married yet, so maybe there's some social isolation, though it's not a major concern here. He's held two jobs recently, which shows he has some stability, which could reduce the risk compared to someone without employment.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, mainly marijuana and cocaine. Recent use within the past month is a bad sign; it indicates ongoing substance abuse, which often correlates with criminal behavior. The fact that he felt down recently suggests possible mental health issues or stress, which can lead to more criminal activity as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four with his biological mother. That's a bit vague, but knowing about his upbringing might highlight family influence or past trauma, though without more info, it's hard to assess impact on recidivism.\n\nHis religious beliefs could either be protective if he uses faith for guidance or potentially a source of stress if he feels unworthy or struggles with it.\n\nConsidering all this, he has two prior arrests, which is a high risk factor. The recent drug use and current emotional state are also high risks. His employment is a low to medium positive factor, while the rest are either negative or neutral. So overall, I'd say high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Two arrests and convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of future rearrest\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) within the past month suggests ongoing substance abuse, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Holding two jobs shows some level of stability, potentially reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a household of four with his biological mother may have influenced his current situation or provide some context for his behavior\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Beliefs about God's influence on personal life may offer some form of coping mechanism or guidance, potentially acting as a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.
