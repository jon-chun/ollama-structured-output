    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this 20-year-old male being rearrested within the next three years. Let's start by looking at all the information given.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, 5'11\" and between 175-199 lbs. That's average build for his age, I think. He hasn't been married and is living alone. Not having a high school diploma or GED could be a problem because it might limit his job opportunities and life skills.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the past year, which is good, but without further education, he might struggle to maintain stable employment in the long term. He's used marijuana in the past four years, and he's been feeling down recently. That could be a sign of mental health issues or stress, which can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a rural area along with two siblings. Living in a rural area might mean limited access to resources or social services, which can increase the risk of recidivism. Also, he doesn't believe in God, which could affect his coping mechanisms and moral reasoning.\n\nHe hasn't been convicted before, but has been arrested twice, so there's some history of involvement with the criminal justice system. However, since he wasn't convicted, it might mean he was diverted or had charges dropped, but still, arrest history is a risk factor.\n\nLooking at the factors one by one:\n\n- Criminal History: He hasn't been convicted, but two arrests. So maybe medium.\n- Age: 20 is a bit young, higher risk for recidivism. So high.\n- Employment: Holding three jobs is positive, so low or medium?\nWait, he's not in college and has only held three jobs. Maybe medium because stable employment can reduce risk, but without more education, it might be medium.\n\n- Education Level: No diploma, so that's a significant risk factor. High.\n- Substance Use: Using marijuana recently, even if just sometimes. So maybe medium-high because substance use is linked to higher recidivism.\n- Mental Health: Feeling down, possible depression or anxiety. That's another high risk factor.\n- Family History: Growing up in a household with three people might not be ideal, but it's not extremely adverse. Maybe low.\n- Religion: Not believing in God could affect his moral framework. So medium-high.\n\nSo assigning weights:\n\nCriminal history: Medium\nAge: High\nEmployment: Medium (he's working, which is good)\nEducation: High\nSubstance Use: Medium-High\nMental Health: High\nFamily History: Low\nReligion: Medium-High\n\nNow, considering all together, he has high risk factors like education and substance use, plus some medium-high. So overall prediction might lean towards rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Based on two arrests without conviction, there is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Three jobs indicate stability but lack of education may affect future stability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma significantly raises recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium_high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down indicates possible instability\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"low\", \"Household size of three in rural area is not highly adverse\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium_high\", \"Lack of belief may impact coping mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
