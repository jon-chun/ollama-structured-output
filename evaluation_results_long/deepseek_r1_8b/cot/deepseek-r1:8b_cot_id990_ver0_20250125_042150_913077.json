    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's 18, which is pretty young. Younger offenders often have less criminal history, which can be both a good and bad sign. On one hand, they might be more malleable and open to rehabilitation. On the other hand, they could be more impulsive or haven't developed better decision-making skills yet.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know that racial factors in the US criminal justice system can influence outcomes, but it's a bit complex. Some studies show higher rates of prosecution for certain offenses among minorities, which might affect her treatment or sentencing probabilities. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe race isn't the most significant factor here.\n\nShe has an arrest history but no convictions. That's interesting because having an arrest without a conviction doesn't always predict future criminal behavior. Some people might get arrested multiple times but never actually reoffend. So her current status could be a neutral or low-risk indicator.\n\nHer physical description: 5'7\" and between 175-199 lbs. I'm not sure how relevant body type affects risk, but weight can sometimes correlate with socioeconomic factors that might influence crime rates. However, without more info, it's hard to assess this factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean she's more independent or maybe has fewer supports in place. It might also indicate some level of responsibility, but it could also mean she lacks supervision, which can be a risk factor for further offending.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school. Education is generally seen as a positive indicator. People with higher education levels tend to have better outcomes and lower crime rates. Being in school suggests she's invested in her future, which might reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe has held 2 jobs during the year. Employment can be a strong protective factor. Having a job shows responsibility, financial stability, and structured routines, all of which can deter criminal activity.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior, and if she continues using, it could increase her chances of reoffending. However, she hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate that she's currently not experiencing the kinds of stressors that could exacerbate drug use or criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four. Growing up in a larger family can provide more support and supervision. However, if the family environment was chaotic or had other issues, it might have contributed to her current situation. Without knowing more about the family dynamics, it's hard to assess this factor accurately.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with her personal life. Lack of spiritual belief can be a risk factor because some studies suggest that spirituality or religious involvement can be protective against delinquency. Without such beliefs, she might lack a support system or moral framework that could prevent recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together: She's young but hasn't been convicted yet. She has some positive factors like education and employment, which are protective. However, her drug use is a red flag, and the absence of spiritual beliefs might leave her without certain supports.\n\nI need to assign weights as low, medium, or high. Drug use seems like a high risk factor since it's directly linked to criminal behavior. The lack of spiritual belief could also be medium risk because it removes one potential protective factor. The other factors like age, employment, education are positive but might not outweigh the risks.\n\nSo, I think the prediction would lean towards \"YES\" she is at higher risk, with moderate confidence around 70% because while there are some protective factors, the drug use and lack of spiritual support are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals may have less criminal history but can be more impulsive.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Racial factors in the US criminal justice system can influence outcomes, though not directly predictive here\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Arrest without conviction is neutral or low risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"Body type doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior without more info\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate independence but lack of supervision\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in school is a strong protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Held 2 jobs indicating responsibility and stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief may remove a protective factor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Household size can provide support but without knowing dynamics, it's unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
