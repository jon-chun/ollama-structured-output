    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old male being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a white male with no prior convictions. But he has been arrested once, which is a red flag, even if it wasn't a conviction. His age is 21, which is a young adult, and younger people tend to have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals.\n\nHe lives alone now but grew up in a large household with both biological parents in a rural area. That could mean he had a stable upbringing initially, which might reduce some risks, but I'm not sure how that ties into his current situation.\n\nHe's enrolled in college and has held one job, showing some responsibility and structure in his life. That's a positive sign because education and employment can be protective factors against criminal behavior.\n\nHis past substance use includes marijuana within the last four years, which is concerning. Drug use is often linked to higher recidivism because it can lead to poor decision-making and increased risk of reoffending.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so there's no current indication of mental health issues, which could be a contributing factor for criminal behavior. However, his past or family history isn't mentioned here.\n\nReligiously, he believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That might provide him with a sense of purpose and could deter criminal activity, acting as a protective factor.\n\nConsidering all this, the factors that stand out are his past arrest (high), current drug use (medium), educational status (low), and religious beliefs (low). His employment and college enrollment are positives but may not be significant enough compared to the negative factors. His age is medium because while it's a risk, he's young but not extremely so.\n\nPutting this together, the high factor of past arrest and current drug use are more impactful, so I'd rate those as high. The others are less influential, so low or medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 205 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
