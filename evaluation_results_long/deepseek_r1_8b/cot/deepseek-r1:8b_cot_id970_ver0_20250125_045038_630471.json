    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old male being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is a young adult. Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates because they might lack impulse control and have fewer institutional memories. So I think that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. From what I know, racial factors can influence outcomes, but I'm not sure if being White specifically increases or decreases the risk compared to other races. It might be a low factor since some studies show similar rates across different groups.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. A history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator. Each arrest adds to the likelihood of future rearrests, so this should be high.\n\nHis physical description: 5'11\" and between 150-174 lbs. I don't know if body type significantly affects recidivism, but it's not a major factor. Maybe low here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the structure that marriage could provide, so this could be medium risk because it might contribute to poor decision-making or lack of supervision.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a big red flag. It limits employment opportunities and can lead to more criminal activity. So this should definitely be high.\n\nHe has held four jobs in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, so having a job might lower the risk. This could be medium as it shows some responsibility.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is positive, but not using them at all isn't common. However, being depression-free might reduce some risks, but I'm not sure how much impact this has. Maybe low since substance abuse is a big driver of crime, but he's clean now.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a single-parent household can be challenging and possibly increase risk. Urban areas also have higher crime rates, so that's another factor contributing to recidivism. This should be medium because both the family structure and environment could influence behavior.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes reduce criminal behavior if it provides a moral framework. So maybe low here as it might have a protective effect.\n\nPutting all this together, factors like prior arrests, lack of education, and upbringing in an urban household are high risks. Employment and no recent depression might mitigate some, but not enough to offset the others. Overall, I think there's a moderate chance he'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"young age may lack impulse control\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"not significantly associated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"multiple arrests and convictions increase risk\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"body type not a major factor\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"living alone may lack supervision\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"no diploma limits opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"job stability may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"clean from drugs but not using them at all\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no depression recent\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"urban and single-parent increase risk\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"may provide moral framework\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
