Age and gender: Being a young female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n2. Prior criminal history: She has only been arrested once, which is a minimal record.\n3. Education: Her enrollment in a 4-year college shows motivation and commitment, which can indicate lower risk.\n4. Employment history: Having held three jobs within the year suggests she is actively engaged in work.\n5. Substance use: While she has used drugs (marijuana), it does not suggest a severe addiction issue that would significantly increase her risk.\n6. Mental health: She has not felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive indicator of lower risk.\n7. Social situation: She does not live alone and has a support system in place.\n8. Family background: Living with her biological mother until adulthood suggests a stable upbringing.\n9. Religious beliefs: Her belief that God influences her life could indicate a sense of morality and responsibility, which might lower her risk.\n\nHowever, the single arrest and conviction, as well as her relatability to urban areas where crime rates may be higher, contribute to a non-negligible risk. The confidence level is set at 65 due to these conflicting factors.",
