While the individual has a history of arrests and convictions, she is young (21 years old), which suggests potential for rehabilitation. She has never been married and is not living alone, indicating some social support systems. Her employment history shows some stability, although limited. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed recently and only used marijuana in the past four years suggests she may not be struggling with significant mental health or substance abuse issues. However, her upbringing in an urban area with a single mother and large family could potentially contribute to risk factors. Her lack of religious belief might also indicate lower levels of social control, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk. The confidence level is relatively low given the ambiguity of some factors.",
