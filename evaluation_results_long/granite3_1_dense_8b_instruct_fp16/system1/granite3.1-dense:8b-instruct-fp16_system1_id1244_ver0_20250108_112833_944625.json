He has maintained steady employment and education, and does not reside in a high-risk urban environment (as inferred from living arrangements and area). His religious beliefs may also contribute to a sense of personal responsibility and morality. Despite some risk factors like being male and having a history of arrest, the overall profile suggests a low risk individual.",
