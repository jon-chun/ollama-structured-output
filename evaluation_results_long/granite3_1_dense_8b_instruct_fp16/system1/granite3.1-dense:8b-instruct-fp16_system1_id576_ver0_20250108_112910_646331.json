Prior arrest and conviction: This indicates a propensity for criminal behavior.\n2. Educational attainment: Not having a high school diploma or GED certificate and not being enrolled in college is associated with higher risk of recidivism.\n3. Employment instability: Having held 4 jobs during the year suggests financial instability and potential for criminal activity related to income generation.\n4. Substance use: Past drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, increases the likelihood of future involvement in criminal activities.\n5. Urban upbringing: Living in an urban area at a young age is associated with higher risk factors due to potential exposure to crime and delinquency.\n6. Lack of a stable family structure: Living with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents suggests instability in her formative years, which can contribute to future criminal behavior.\n7. Religious beliefs: While considering that God has something to do with personal events is generally positive, it doesn't significantly offset the high-risk factors present in this case.",
