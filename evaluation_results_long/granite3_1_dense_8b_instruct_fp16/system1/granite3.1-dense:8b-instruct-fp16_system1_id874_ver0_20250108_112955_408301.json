The individual is young, which generally correlates with lower recidivism rates. He has only been arrested and convicted once, suggesting minimal involvement in criminal activity. His physical health indicators (height and weight) are within normal ranges. He is enrolled in college and holds a high school diploma, which can positively impact future prospects and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. His employment history shows stability, despite having held three jobs within a year. He has not felt depressed recently and has only used marijuana, a less serious drug, in the past four years. His family background includes living with both parents until adulthood, which can provide positive influences. However, his lack of religious belief or spirituality might suggest less internalized moral or ethical constraints. Despite these factors, the overall risk level is considered low due to the absence of severe risk indicators and presence of several protective factors.",
