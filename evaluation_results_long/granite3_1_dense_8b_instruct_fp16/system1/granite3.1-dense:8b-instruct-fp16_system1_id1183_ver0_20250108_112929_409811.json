The individual is relatively young, has only been arrested and convicted once, has no history of depression, and has not used drugs frequently in the past four years. Although he has lived with adults other than his parents, there's no indication of unstable home environments or abuse. He has a GED certificate, which suggests some level of education, but not being enrolled in college might indicate a lack of future prospects. However, the lack of employment does not necessarily correlate with high risk, especially considering his age and the fact that he's only been arrested once. His religious beliefs may also suggest a sense of moral responsibility. Therefore, based on these factors, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 75%.",
