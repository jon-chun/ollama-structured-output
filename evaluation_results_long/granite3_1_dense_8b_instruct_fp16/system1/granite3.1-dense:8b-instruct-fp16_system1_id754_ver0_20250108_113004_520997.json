His age, lack of criminal history beyond the single arrest, physical attributes, marital status, educational background, employment status, absence of depression, and family structure suggest low-risk factors. The fact that he considers God has something to do with his life might also be indicative of a moral or ethical framework that could mitigate against criminal behavior. However, this is a subjective factor and its predictive value may vary. Overall, given the available data, the prediction leans towards low risk.",
