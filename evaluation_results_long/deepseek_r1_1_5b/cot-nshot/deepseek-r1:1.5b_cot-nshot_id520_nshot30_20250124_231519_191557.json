    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. So, the user has given a detailed case study of a 21-year-old female who is white, not convicted yet, living alone with her biological mother, etc. They want me to assign weights to each risk factor and predict recidivism outcome.\n\nFirst, I need to go through each risk factor mentioned in the provided examples and see which ones apply here. The factors are: age (young adult), living alone, no previous convictions, high school diploma, not enrolled in college, number of jobs, drug use, depression, family size, and living area.\n\nLooking at the case, she's a young adult, living alone, not convicted yet, so that's relevant. She has no previous convictions\u2014she only had 1 arrest, which is recent. She doesn't have a high school diploma or college enrollment, but she does hold a job. She used marijuana and cocaine, which are substance use, and hasn't been depressed in the past month. Her family size was small before, but since her mother is living alone, that might reduce strain.\n\nIn the examples, factors like \"not convicted yet\" are low because recidivism increases when you're not convicted. High school diploma isn't in play here as she's a young adult with a job already. Family size being 6 could be considered medium, maybe a bit strained but manageable. Substance use and depression were avoided in the past month.\n\nLooking at other examples where substance use didn't cause recidivism, like example #28 or #29, maybe it's a low weight because she's avoiding it. But since she did use it, that might be a medium factor, as it could still lead to problems but not necessarily repeat recidivism.\n\nHer family living alone was a low risk in the examples where someone lived with a partner, so that makes sense here too. So overall, her age is low, but maybe high because she's young and single. Family size is medium, job is present, no previous convictions\u2014low or medium? Since she has one arrest, it might still be considered low risk.\n\nSo, putting it all together: low (age), low (family living alone), low (no conviction), low (job), low (substance use since avoiding in the past month but not entirely avoiding), medium (nothing else). But wait, she's high school educated and hasn't enrolled, which might be a bit higher.\n\nBut looking at another example where someone with a low family size, no convictions, job, low substance use is considered a low risk. So maybe this case would also be classified as low risk. The recidivism outcome in examples with all these factors being low is \"NO\", so I'm guessing that's the prediction.\n\nSo, the confidence is high since all relevant factors are low and others are manageable.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young adult\", \"low\", \"not older than 21 years old\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"no family present except biological parent\"),\n    (\"no previous convictions\", \"low\", \"only 1 arrest since last conviction, no prior issues\"),\n    (\"high school diploma and not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"high school education but not pursued further\"),\n    (\"not employed or under job supervision\", \"medium\", \"already working for a job before\"),\n    (\"substance use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"low\", \"avoiding recent issues\"),\n    (\"depression, 0-3 months of history\", \"low\", \"avoided in the past month\"),\n    (\"family size (6 people living together)\", \"low\", \"family was small before but now is medium because of living alone with biological mother and 5 others\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
