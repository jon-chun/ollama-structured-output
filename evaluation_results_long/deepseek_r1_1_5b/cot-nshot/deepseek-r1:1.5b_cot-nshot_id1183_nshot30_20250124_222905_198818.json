    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old Black male. First, I need to break down each risk factor mentioned in the examples and see how they apply here.\n\nThe case is a 22-year-old Black male who's been arrested once and convicted. He's 6 feet tall (I think that was probably an error, but maybe it's correct as given), weighs 178 lbs., never married, living alone, has no jobs, used marijuana for the past four years, hasn't felt depressed, and lived with non-biological parents in a small urban household.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, especially those where people have been convicted or had prior crimes. For instance, in Example #21, a Black male was 22, 6'0\", weighing 178 lbs., never married, living alone, no jobs, used marijuana for past four years, and lived with non-biological parents in a small household. The recidivism outcome was NO.\n\nAnother example where someone had prior convictions (Example #22) also resulted in NO recidivism. Similarly, Example #23: 21-year-old Black male, caught again, same stats\u2014recidivism was NO. So, having been convicted or even re-arrested is a negative factor that reduces recidivism.\n\nThe other risk factors are non-critical. For example, no prior jobs (Example #24 and #25) led to NO outcomes. No education, like GED (Example #30), also resulted in NO. Negative drug use (marijuana) and not feeling depressed are neutral here because the case didn't involve substance abuse.\n\nThe key factors seem to be: being Black, prior convictions, no prior jobs, living alone. All these together indicate that this individual is at higher risk of re-arresting. So their recidivism would likely be NO.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black\", \"low\", \"A Black individual with a history of prior criminal convictions and living in a low-risk household may face lower recidivism rates but can still re-arrest based on other factors like substance use\"),\n    (\"convicted\", \"medium\", \"The conviction history, especially if severe or frequent, significantly impacts recidivism\"),\n    (\"no prior jobs\", \"low\", \"Living alone and having no prior work history reduces the likelihood of seeking employment in the future\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Being living with non-biological parents in a small household may influence decisions regarding re-arrest based on family support and support systems\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
