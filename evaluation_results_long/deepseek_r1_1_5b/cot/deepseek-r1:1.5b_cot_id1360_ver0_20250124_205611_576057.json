    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this young Black woman who's lived with her biological mother. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female, which suggests that she might have some underlying issues. She identifies as Black and has never been convicted of any crimes, but she's been arrested twice without conviction. That seems concerning because past arrest can indicate potential recidivism. However, being arrested twice in one year is still unusual for someone who hasn't had any convictions yet.\n\nHer family size is two, which could mean she might have limited support and fewer resources available to her. That could affect her ability to provide support during her recovery or reintegration into society, which is important for recidivism prediction.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That's a significant issue because many factors related to recidivism are tied to educational attainment. Without higher education, she might lack the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed after release.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but has used marijuana. Although this doesn't directly affect recidivism risk, it's an important factor for substance use disorders which can be associated with reoffending or recovery issues.\n\nShe's never felt depressed over the past month, though depression is a common symptom of mental health struggles and might contribute to recidivism in some cases. However, her lack of this symptom could make some factors less relevant.\n\nShe's lived with her biological mother for two years and considers God to have something to do with her life. This family dynamic can provide emotional support during tough times, which is a positive factor. Additionally, living alone might give her more stability and resources, indirectly reducing recidivism risks.\n\nHer age being young and Black adds layers of complexity. Black individuals often face higher rates of crime due to systemic issues like racism and poverty. The lack of education and limited support at home could exacerbate these factors. However, she's not living in an area with a high crime rate or significant resources, which might mitigate some risks.\n\nPutting it all together, her past arrest twice without conviction is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. Her family dynamics, lack of education, and being raised by someone who may have influenced her could contribute to factors that increase the risk. While she's been in a loving relationship with her biological mother for two years, that dynamic doesn't necessarily make her more likely to reoffend.\n\nHowever, without higher education, less job stability, and limited access to resources, these factors seem to be present or contributing. The lack of substance use problems is also a plus, though marijuana could still play into recovery or reintegration.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the risk is moderate but not extremely high. It might increase slightly due to her family environment and potential lack of higher education. But overall, it's something she needs to watch out for.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"family_dynamics\", \"moderate\", \"lived_with_biological_mother_in_two_years, limited resources, emotionally supportive relationships\"),\n    (\"higher_education\", \"moderate\", \"no high school diploma or GED, may lack critical knowledge and skills for reintegration\"),\n    (\"poverty/food_stamp\", \"medium\", \"unstable family, limited job opportunities, no income support outside of biological mother)),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"never used marijuana, could contribute to substance use disorder but not a high risk factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
