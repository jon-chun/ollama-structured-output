    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assign recidivism risk factors for this person. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Asian male who's been arrested twice and has a high school diploma in college. He's living alone and never married yet. That seems like he might not have had time to engage in any criminal behavior after being released, so that could be a risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches, weighs 135 lbs, is living alone, hasn't used a job since his last arrest, has no substance abuse history, and doesn't feel depressed. At age 18, he was raised in a household of five people, which might mean more support from family or friends to handle his situation.\n\nHis religious beliefs are mentioned, but I'm not sure how relevant that is. He's considered that God influences his personal life, so maybe there's some cultural aspect here. But it doesn't directly impact recidivism risk factors unless his beliefs significantly affect his behavior post-arrest.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 18 years old could mean less experience in criminal behavior compared to younger individuals, but since he's never married and is living alone, that might contribute.\n2. Education: High school diploma in college suggests some prior criminal history or education beyond basic skills, which could be a risk factor.\n3. Marital status: Single at the time of arrest, which may have influenced his behavior; not having used a job since release could mean less engagement with activities that would lead to reoffending.\n4. Substance abuse: No past use of drugs in four years and no feelings of depression over the last month\u2014this is an important factor because substance abuse can lead to relapse and recidivism.\n5. Family support: R raised him in a household of five, which might mean more resources for handling his situation post-arrest.\n\nSo putting this together, the factors are age (low), education (medium), marital status (low, as single), substance use (high), family support (low, more resources). \n\nFor recidivism risk, age and marital status being low might mean less prior criminal behavior. However, education in college could indicate some background that contributes to reoffending. Substance use is high, which can lead to relapse. Family support isn't the strongest here.\n\nThe overall assessment seems high because there's a mix of factors: some risk (substance abuse) and some low risk (age, marital status). However, given that he's never used a job since release, maybe it's less likely. But without more info on substance use, I think it leans towards moderate risk.\n\nSo the prediction would be YES with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"18 years old may have had less experience in criminal behavior compared to younger individuals.\",\n    \"The lack of marriage and single status at the time of arrest could contribute to his behavior.\",\n    \"No family support information was provided, which might influence recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
