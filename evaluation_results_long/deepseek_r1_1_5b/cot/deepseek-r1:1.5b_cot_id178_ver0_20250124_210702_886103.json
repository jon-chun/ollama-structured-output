    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this young Black male who's lived with his mother in an urban area. The user provided a detailed set of points about his background, which seems quite concerning.\n\nFirst, I should assess each factor one by one. He's 20, has been arrested 8 times, and is facing rearrest within three years. That's a significant number of recurrences. His identity as Black might have some influence on recidivism rates, but it's still a concern because Black individuals often face higher rates than others.\n\nHe's never married and living alone could mean he has less support network available to him during his incarceration or after release. Living in an urban area with seven family members is quite a burden; maybe more stress and potential isolation. He's not educated up to a high school diploma, which might make it harder for him to handle the stress of being in a difficult situation without a stable environment.\n\nHe has used substances\u2014cocaine and marijuana\u2014in the past four years and some time ago. substance abuse can be a major factor in recidivism because it affects his decision-making and mental health. But it's not without hope since there are support services available, especially for Black individuals.\n\nHis family history isn't very strong, but he lives with his biological mother. That could mean he has less control over his life after release. The impact of living alone during incarceration might be severe, affecting both his physical and emotional health. He used drugs four years ago, which is concerning, but also gives hope because there's support available.\n\nPutting it all together, I should consider each factor's likelihood to contribute significantly to his recidivism risk. With a high number of arrests and substance use, he's at a higher risk than average. The urban environment and living alone add more stressors that can influence recidivism. His Black background might play a role in increasing the risk but not by a large margin compared to other factors.\n\nI should also think about community support systems since his family is small. Inadequate support can slow down recovery, especially for someone like him. The use of substances could make him more vulnerable, but there's still hope due to available services.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I would predict a high risk of recidivism within the next three years because of the numerous factors that contribute significantly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\" lived_in_a_urban_area\", \"high\", \"exposure to urban environments and stress\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"medium\", \"small family size and limited support\"),\n    (\"no_highschool education\", \"medium\", \"impact of living alone and lack of control\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\", \"potential for substance dependency issues\"),\n    (\"black_identity\", \"high\", \"enhanced recidivism risks due to Black identity effects\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 8 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 154 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.
