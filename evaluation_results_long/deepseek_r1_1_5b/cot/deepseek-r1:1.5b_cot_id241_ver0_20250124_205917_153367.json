    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person will rearrest within three years. Let me start by breaking down the information given.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted, which is interesting because that means her previous behavior might still affect recidivism rates. She's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 110 lbs. She's never married and lives alone, which could mean she has less support from family or friends compared to someone who's lived with a partner.\n\nShe doesn't have a GED yet but hasn't dropped it because she might not want to take on college now. She's not enrolled in college either. In the past four years, she used drugs\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014most of her time during the last month when she was feeling down. That's concerning because drug use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n\nAt age 19, she lived with both biological parents in a household of size four in an urban area. She feels down sometimes, which makes me think about mood disorders or other stressors that might influence behavior. As an adult, she's not engaged in college studies.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, I need to assess each risk factor and determine how likely she is to rearrest within three years. Let me list out the potential risk factors:\n\n1. Previous drug use: 2-3 times a day (most days).\n2. Current mood issues from feelings down in the dumps.\n3. Lack of support at age 19.\n4. Unrelated substance use (cocaine) which was mostly during the last month when she felt low.\n\nI remember that substance use history can be a strong risk factor because it's often associated with recidivism, even if the individual hasn't been convicted yet. Drug use across days is usually not a common finding in recidivism data because it's rare and usually doesn't correlate well with future behavior.\n\nMood issues from extreme feelings are also significant. If someone experiences deep sadness or despair, they might have lower self-esteem and less motivation to engage in new behaviors. This could lead them to either avoid actions that worsen their situation or persist into adulthood.\n\nThe lack of support at 19 is another concern because it can affect both physical and mental health. If someone can't access a family or friends around them, it might make it harder for them to stay engaged in activities that contribute to recidivism. This could lead to feelings of isolation and decreased motivation to change behavior.\n\nSince she's not enrolled in college, her education level might limit opportunities to enter the workforce again, but that doesn't directly translate into recidivism risk unless there are other factors like lack of access to education or training.\n\nPutting this together, while her drug use has been a consistent issue, it hasn't led to prior conviction. However, substance use across days and especially during times of severe mood decline could still be considered a risk factor because it's often linked with recidivism. The other factors like living alone, lack of support at 19, and not being able to access education or resources might contribute but aren't as directly tied to recidivism.\n\nI think the strength here is her consistent use of substances, especially during extreme emotional times. This could indicate a mental health issue that persists into adulthood, which might be associated with recidivism rates. However, without conviction history, it's hard to say definitively whether she will rearrest. But given the consistent substance use and mood issues, I lean towards her having a higher risk of rearrest within three years.\n\nSo, the prediction would likely be YES because these factors collectively suggest an increased risk despite not having a conviction record.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_drug_use\", \"medium\", \"consistent use across days but not leading to convictions\"),\n    (\"current_moodIssues\", \"medium\", \"feeling down in the dumps and low self-esteem could influence behavior\"),\n    (\"lack_of_support\", \"high\", \"unrelated stressors from living alone and feeling isolated\"),\n    (\"no_enrollment_in_college\", \"medium\", \"might impact opportunities but not directly recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
