    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for a person who's a 20-year-old male living alone. He's white, has been arrested once, and is currently rearresting. He's 5'11\" and weighs 150-174 lbs. He hasn't married yet, is living alone, has a high school diploma in college, holds two jobs, used drugs (cocaine and marijuana) in the past four years, didn't feel depressed over the last month, and lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. \n\nFirst, I should consider each factor individually and then see how they collectively impact rearrest recidivism.\n\n1. **Age**: He's young, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to adults. So maybe he has a low risk here.\n2. **Marital Status**: Single. Unmarried individuals are typically more likely to reoffend because they lack support networks. This might increase the risk.\n3. **Living Situation**: Single and living alone in an urban area with one biological parent (household size 4). Urban living can be risky due to higher crime rates, but since he's single, it adds another layer of stress. Maybe a mix of high and low here.\n4. **Education**: High school diploma in college. Higher education is generally associated with lower recidivism because people are more likely to find work or help out. But he's still in college, which might not be the highest, so maybe medium risk.\n5. **Job History**: Two jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can sometimes lead to instability and higher risks of reoffending due to financial strain. This could increase his recidivism chances.\n6. **Drug Use history**: Past four years with marijuana and cocaine. Medication use is strongly linked to recidivism because it disrupts a person's ability to function normally, leading to problems at work or home. High risk here.\n7. **Depression**: No feelings of depression over the last month. This seems low; if he had felt depressed, his recidivism might be higher.\n8. **Family Size and Location**: Urban area with one biological parent in a household of size 4. Urban living can lead to higher crimes, but single status adds stress. Maybe a mix\u2014high due to crime, medium due to stress.\n\nNow, weighing these factors: age (low), living alone and single (medium), education (medium), job history (medium), drug use (high), family status (mixed), and living in urban area with one parent (medium). The high risk factors are the drug use and living in an urban area. The other factors seem lower but not entirely non-existent.\n\nI think the overall recidivism would be a mix\u2014some low, some medium, and a couple of high risks. So, maybe around 70% chance to rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"mixed\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"job history\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\"),\n    (\"family status\", \"mixed\"),\n    (\"location\", \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
