Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male, Black, who has been arrested once but hasn't convicted. He's 5'7\" and 130-150 lbs. He's never married and lives alone. He has a high school diploma, not in college, and has one job. He's used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed for the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area, and God has something to do with it.\n\nSo, starting with recidivism risks. Age is a factor\u201422 seems young. Not being Black might be significant if people of that background face different recidivism rates. He's been arrested once but hasn't convicted, which could indicate he's still dealing with guilt or fear. Being 5'7\" and size 5 in an urban area might mean he's in a less secure environment than someone in a larger household.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, so no family support system that could help him reintegrate. He has one job but not two, which might limit opportunities to apply for reentry programs or jobs. Having used drugs before doesn't necessarily translate to recidivism risk unless there are underlying issues like addiction. Not feeling depressed over the past month is positive, but it's still a low score.\n\nLiving alone in an urban area with his biological mother could mean more uncertainty about housing and job opportunities. The high school diploma without college suggests he didn't attend a good education, which might affect reentry success rates. He's been arrested once, so there's some recidivism potential, but it's not high yet.\n\nPutting this all together, the risk is moderate to low. There are factors like his age, lack of family support, and previous drug use that could contribute to recidivism. However, he hasn't engaged in criminal behavior post-arrest, so recidivism isn't certain.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22-year-old male facing potential reintegration barriers\"),\n    (\"family support\", \"low\", \"lived alone with a small household of 5 in an urban area\"),\n    (\"no family to rely on for support or resources\"),\n    (\"previous drug use\", \"medium\", \"did not engage in criminal behavior since arrested\"),\n    (\"unresolved issues\", \"low\", \"not feeling depressed over the past month\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}",
