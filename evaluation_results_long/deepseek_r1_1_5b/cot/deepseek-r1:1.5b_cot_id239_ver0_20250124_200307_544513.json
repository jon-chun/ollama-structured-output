    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a high risk because multiple convictions can indicate potential recidivism. I remember that if someone is caught again and then released or goes back to school, it might suggest they're at higher risk.\n\nHis height is 7 feet 3 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He's never been married and lives alone without a high school diploma or GED. That's a lot of negatives. High school diploma or GED are important because they provide better job opportunities and education, which can lead to recidivism. Without them, he might struggle in the workforce, increasing his risk.\n\nHe's lived with his biological father for five kids, so that's in an urban area. Urban areas have higher crime rates, more housing issues, and stricter law enforcement. That could make him a target for crime or reoffending.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That seems like a negative factor because stress from drug use can affect mental health, possibly increasing recidivism risk.\n\nHis living situation is important too. He's young and raised by his father. That could mean less support for community services or other social services, which might make him more likely to reenter the workforce or society.\n\nI think all these factors together\u2014being from a low educational background, urban residence, living alone, drug use history, and possibly living in an unstable home\u2014highly increase his rearrest risk. I'll assign each factor a high weight because they contribute significantly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"low\", \"19-year-old male with multiple convictions, low educational background, urban residence, living alone, potentially unstable home environment\"),\n    (\"medium\", \"low education lowers job opportunities and increases recidivism risk without support services\"),\n    (\"high\", \"lived with biological father for five kids in an urban area, possibly unstable living situation affecting mental health\"),\n    (\"high\", \"used marijuana despite no recent feelings of depression, contributing to stress and potential recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 7 feet 3 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
