    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking me to assess this person's risk factors for rearrest over three years. Let me break down what they provided.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the relevant risk factors. The person is a 20-year-old, White, who's been arrested once and convicted. She's married but living alone, doesn't have a high school diploma, and hasn't enrolled in college. She has one job, used drugs (cocaine and marijuana) for the past four years, hasn't felt depressed in the last month, and considers God unrelated to her personal life.\n\nNow, I'll evaluate each factor individually. The age being young could mean she's more vulnerable because of genetic predispositions. Being White might introduce some racial disparities in sentencing, but it doesn't directly indicate a risk. Marrying while living alone is unique; that's rare and could be a significant stressor. Not having a high school diploma or GED suggests potential for lower education levels, which might affect job security or mental health. She hasn't used college, so she might have less access to higher education, which could lead to career issues and, over time, criminal behavior.\n\nThe drug use is concerning because substance abuse can cause significant stress and untreated anxiety, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. Not feeling depressed in the past month is a positive trait; however, it's still something to watch for as life changes can affect mental health. Driving under the influence or other behavioral issues could be factors too.\n\nPutting all this together, there are multiple vulnerabilities pointing towards recidivism. Her age might indicate genetic risk, her marital status and living situation could cause stress, lack of education might prevent better job opportunities, drug use could lead to addiction and stress, and mental health challenges from the past month still exist. \n\nI think these factors add up to a high probability of rearrest within three years. However, it's important to note that recidivism is influenced by many variables, including family dynamics, community support, and personal circumstances like substance use and mental health.\n\nSo I'll list all these as risk factors, assign each a low, medium, or high based on their impact. Then summarize the overall prediction as likely, considering her multiple vulnerabilities.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Her young age may suggest genetic predispositions that could increase recidivism rates over time.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with a biological mother is unique and could introduce stressors that contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED suggests potential for lower education levels, which may affect job security and mental health.\"),\n    (\"substance_use history\", \"low\", \"Despite not feeling depressed in the past month, substance abuse can lead to significant stress and untreated anxiety over time, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"job_search_history\", \"medium\", \"She has held one job during the year but does not provide specifics about her education or career plans.
