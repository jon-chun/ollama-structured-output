    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person will rearrest within the next three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18, which is a young age. That usually means there's more chance of reoffending because they might try harder to change their behavior. But since he's only two arrests already, maybe that's less concerning? I'm not sure though; age can vary and factors like education level matter too.\n\nHe's male, and while gender plays a role in some crimes, it doesn't affect recidivism rates much compared to other factors. So gender isn't the main concern here.\n\nHis race is White, which doesn't seem to be a big factor either because different racial groups have different recidivism rates. I think race usually has more impact on how likely someone is to reoffend.\n\nHe's an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. That might make him feel more comfortable about changing behavior, but again, age and gender are still key here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted, so that's a clear indicator of past behavior problems. More arrests in the past can increase his risk to rearrest because it shows he's struggling with recidivism issues.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs. While height is somewhat relevant, I don't recall any significant link between physical size and recidivism rates for this age group. So maybe that factor doesn't contribute much.\n\nHis weight isn't a big issue here either. It might have been more about growth or other factors, but I'm not sure how it affects recidivism.\n\nHe's never married and is living alone now. Being single can lead to different kinds of issues compared to being married, which in turn might affect criminal behavior. But since he's 18, that alone isn't a strong factor in recidivism risk for him yet.\n\nHe's enrolled in school at the present moment. That suggests he's actively looking for opportunities to change his behavior or improve his skills. This active involvement can sometimes prevent reoffending because they're better equipped to handle future situations without getting caught again.\n\nHe's been using drugs four years ago\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. His drug use history is significant, but I think recidivism rates for individuals who've used substances before being convicted are generally lower than those who haven't. However, he's a young person with limited resources, so maybe this makes him more vulnerable because they might have taken up substance abuse earlier without much support.\n\nHe lives in an urban area with four biological parents, which could be a concern for substance abuse or accessing mental health services if needed. Maybe living in a larger city means access to resources that smaller cities don't offer as effectively, but I'm not sure how that translates directly into recidivism risk.\n\nHe's considered that God has something to do with his personal issues. That's interesting because it suggests he might have some underlying spiritual or moral conflict, which could lead him to engage in behavior that makes him more prone to reoffending. However, since he's a young adult without much criminal history, this factor needs to be balanced against other aspects.\n\nPutting all these factors together: Age is a big one because it increases recidivism risk, especially for young people. The number of arrests and convictions are clear indicators of past behavior issues. His drug use history adds another layer, but since he's still young, maybe it hasn't been enough to prevent reoffending yet. Living in an urban area might mean access to resources that help with substance abuse, which could mitigate his risk a bit. The fact that he considers God involved might indicate underlying issues, but without significant support systems or experiences of crime, it's not clear how this affects his recidivism rate.\n\nThe overall assessment is that while there are some factors contributing to the risk, especially the number of arrests and previous convictions, the person hasn't shown a pattern of reoffending. The other factors like age, lack of family support in urban areas, and God involvement aren't conclusive against him yet.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"high\"),\n    (\"number of arrests\", \"medium\", \"low\"),\n    (\"previous convictions\", \"medium\", \"low\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"low\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"lack of support systems\", \"low\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"consideration of external factors\", \"low\", \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
