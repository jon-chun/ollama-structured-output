I need to analyze each factor they mentioned.\n\nStarting with age: 22 is young, usually associated with lower recidivism rates. That's a good sign. Marital status in urban areas can influence behavior; living with both parents might offer support and stress levels that affect recovery.\n\nPrevious drug use over four years shows a risk because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior. The lack of depression for the past month suggests a stable mental health situation, which is protective.\n\nEmployment history: 3 jobs seem manageable, but without a clear pattern or issues, it's safer. Education in a graduate program indicates some academic ability, though maybe not strong enough for criminal activity.\n\nFamily background from 5 feet 10 inches suggests a balanced family life, which could affect overall behavior. Being living alone at age 22 is concerning because it might lead to isolation and substance use. The gender identity aspect doesn't directly impact risk factors much unless it's a unique case, but I'll focus on the given points.\n\nPutting this together, most factors are positive except for substance abuse. But with a stable family background and some education, there's a chance of recidivism. The 22-year-old is young, so maybe a low to medium risk overall.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous substance use\", \"low\" because drug use over four years indicates a higher risk for criminal behavior),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\" because being living alone at age 22 may lead to issues affecting recovery),\n    (\"marital status\", \"high\" but in an urban area, which can sometimes offer support and stress levels that affect decision-making),\n    (\" employment history\", \"medium\" as having three jobs is manageable but might indicate some potential for poor decisions without clear patterns),\n    (\"education\", \"low\" because a graduate program may not be sufficient to commit to criminal behavior),\n    (\"gender identity\", \"medium\" but gender doesn't directly impact recidivism risk factors)\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.
