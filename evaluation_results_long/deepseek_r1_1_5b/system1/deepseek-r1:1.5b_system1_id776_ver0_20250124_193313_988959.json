    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 19 years old. Generally, at this age, most people are considered young, so not overly risky based on age alone.\n\n2. **Race/Identification**: He identifies as White and has never been married, which are positive signs of safety in many places. Being a 19-year-old is also not indicative of danger due to age.\n\n3. **Arrest History**: He's been arrested once and convicted. While this is an improvement over never being charged, it doesn't necessarily indicate risk unless there's a history of past crimes linked to his behavior or location.\n\n4. **Physical Attributes**: 6 feet tall and 190 lbs \u2013 average for his age. Size isn't typically a high indicator of danger.\n\n5. **Marriage Status**: Not married, living alone, and having a household of size four. Living in rural areas without significant family ties can be safer, especially with less supervision.\n\n6. **Education**: High school diploma, 4-year college enrollment \u2013 these are all positive attributes indicating he has the education to handle potential charges or issues.\n\n7. **Job History**: Has worked two jobs during the year \u2013 employment history helps in assessing if there's any risk of job-related issues, though not directly dangerous factors.\n\n8. **Drug Use Record**: Used marijuana four years ago but hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This shows a lack of recent substance abuse, which is a positive sign.\n\n9. **Social and Relationship Issues**: Lives with both biological parents in a rural household of size 4. Living alone without significant family presence can sometimes be safer, though it's not an automatic indicator of danger.\n\n10. **God Connection**: Identifies God as having something to do with his life, which is positive but doesn't inherently indicate risk unless there are external factors at play.\n\nConsidering all these points, while he has some positive attributes, particularly in education and being living alone, the arrest history and physical health aren't high indicators of danger. However, living in a rural area without significant family ties might contribute to a safer environment compared to cities with more supervision or social support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
