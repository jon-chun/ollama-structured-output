So, my main goal is to evaluate their provided risk factors and determine whether they indicate high risk.\n\nFirst, let's break down the user's information. The person is 21 years old, Hispanic, has been arrested three times, and convicted. That's already a red flag because arrests and convictions are big indicators of high risk. Being 5 feet 11 inches and weighing between 175 to 199 pounds also sounds heavy for someone who hasn't had much time in the workforce.\n\nHe's separated and living alone, which is another key sign that they might not be able to support themselves or others easily. His education level is low\u2014no high school diploma or GED. Not enrolled in college means he doesn't have a stable job or income, making him vulnerable to exploitation or other forms of abuse.\n\nHe hasn't had much employment during the past year, but in the past four years, he used drugs, mostly marijuana and cocaine, and sometimes he felt down, which could indicate addiction. However, this might be temporary if he's managing it well or if his problems are resolved later.\n\nThe user also mentions that at a young age, they lived with adults other than their biological parents in a household of size four in an urban area. This kind of living situation can make someone more vulnerable to exploitation, fraud, or abuse because they're not alone as much as others might be.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of being caught multiple times, low education, separation and living alone, heavy weight, and potential addiction makes him a high risk individual. The other factors like his age and how he lived in an urban household add to the risk profile.\n\nSo, I'm confident that this person should be flagged as high risk based on these details.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 92\n}",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He is separated and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
