    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male. That's within the age range for most criminal justice assessments. He identifies as White and has no issues with race in his mental health. His background is clear: arrested five times, convicted once. That's significant. He's 6'5\" and 210 lbs, which doesn't seem extreme.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. That might raise some red flags because typically single individuals are less likely to engage in dangerous behavior unless there's a specific reason. \n\nHis GED is important. If he didn't go to college yet, that could delay his criminal justice education but not inherently indicate a higher risk. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years except for marijuana and cocaine, which are known substances but not illegal if they're legal. However, the context might make it seem more dangerous.\n\nHe's not feeling depressed over the past month. While mental health is important, this seems low compared to previous months or overall. \n\nLiving in a household of size 4 in an urban area. Urban settings can be stressful and may offer opportunities for deviant behaviors due to the environment being crowded and populated with others. That could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his life, which might suggest spiritual involvement but doesn't directly indicate delinquency or criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He's caught five times, convicted once, never married, living alone, moderate drug use (but not illegal), low depression, urban setting. While he's arrested, the context of a small family in an urban area might provide some stressors. However, since he's never married and hasn't used drugs, his criminal history isn't too high. But the urban environment could introduce some risks that aren't fully mitigated by other factors.\n\nI'm leaning towards NO because while there are some indicators like living alone or being in a city, they might not be enough to push it into high risk without more context. But I should consider if any of these points strongly suggest higher risk beyond just the typical criminal record.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
