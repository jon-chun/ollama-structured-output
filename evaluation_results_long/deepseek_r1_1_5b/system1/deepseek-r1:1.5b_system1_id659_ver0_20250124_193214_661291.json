    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk for this person based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as anything concerning criminal justice, but it's important because being white can sometimes lead to certain societal issues, though not necessarily criminal ones.\n\nShe has been arrested 9 times and convicted. That's quite high for someone at her age. Being 21, she's probably in a more vulnerable position financially or lawfully. Each arrest carries significant weight. The fact that she's been convicted means she might have entered a dangerous situation where others can target her.\n\nShe is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 105 lbs. That seems normal for a person of her age, so this isn't an indicator of risk related to physical health issues.\n\nHer height and weight don't suggest any mental or criminal risk. They are just average values, not extremes that would indicate something concerning.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently not living alone. While being single might be a minor social issue, it doesn't necessarily relate to criminal behavior. Social factors don't typically drive someone into crime unless there's a specific threat they can perceive or fear.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. That could mean she's working or hasn't decided to go further education. However, not being enrolled doesn't inherently indicate criminal risk; it's just another aspect of her life stage.\n\nShe is not employed and does not currently work. This might affect her ability to secure a job or enter into relationships, but again, this isn't directly linked to criminal behavior unless there are specific threats present.\n\nShe has held 1 job during the year. With only one job, she's likely facing some risks of entering criminal situations if that job is unstable or dangerous.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using drugs and not feeling depressed doesn't directly point to criminal behavior but might indicate a need for intervention if they're struggling with substances or mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. This raises some concerns about family dynamics, possibly affecting her ability to leave the household and secure higher-paying jobs later in life. Urban living might have certain risks, but not necessarily criminal ones unless there's a specific threat they're facing.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. While personal beliefs can influence behavior, this doesn't provide concrete evidence of any underlying risk factors related to criminal justice assessment.\n\nPutting it all together, the person has been arrested multiple times, which is a strong indicator of potential criminal activity, especially at such an age and in a vulnerable situation. Other factors like substance use or mental health aren't directly linked to criminal behavior but might affect their well-being. The household size and living conditions could impact future opportunities but don't inherently indicate criminal risk.\n\nTherefore, the overall assessment should lean towards high risk because of the multiple arrests and potential instability in her life stage.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
