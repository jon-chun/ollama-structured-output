    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors given for this 21-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male and has a high school diploma, not enrolled in college. That might be a concern because not being in college could lead to criminal behavior. But since he hasn't used drugs or felt depressed in the past month, maybe his age isn't the primary issue here.\n\nNext, he identifies as Hispanic. I know that Hispanic communities often face more issues related to poverty, violence, and social inequality. Being a minor, especially, might make him more vulnerable if there's a family conflict with his biological parents. But since he's not married yet, that could be a stretch in terms of potential criminal behavior.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches, which is physically healthy for his age, but again, being a minor might bring some stress or vulnerability. His weight is at 215 lbs, which seems okay. He hasn't used drugs, so no substance abuse issues yet. However, he hasn't been convicted of anything, so no criminal history to exploit.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone, which could mean he has a stable family, but that doesn't inherently make him more likely to commit crime as a minor. His family size is 4, not extremely large, which might suggest less stress or potential for abuse in a larger household. But being minor here adds another layer of vulnerability.\n\nHe's God-god concerned with his personal life, which is interesting but not directly related to criminal behavior. So, while he might have spiritual or family issues, it doesn't indicate high risk for crime as a minor.\n\nPutting it all together, his age isn't the main issue because he hasn't been convicted yet. The minor status and stable family make him at risk, especially in a vulnerable situation like being with his biological parents. However, since he's not married and living alone, those factors don't seem to contribute to higher criminal risk. But given that he's a minor with a high school diploma, it does increase the risk of criminal behavior.\n\nSo, I think this person is at high risk because of the minor status, family stability, and the fact that he might face issues in his relationship.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
