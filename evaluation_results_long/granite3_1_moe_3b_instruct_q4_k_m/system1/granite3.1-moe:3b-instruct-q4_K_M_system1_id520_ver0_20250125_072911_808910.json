The single arrest record (not a conviction), stable living arrangements, and no history of violent crimes or major offenses indicate a low likelihood of reoffending. Her age, weight, height, education level, job stability, and lack of criminal involvement with drugs further support this assessment. The presence of a supportive family background (albeit not ideal) also suggests positive influences in her life. However, it's crucial to consider other individual circumstances that may influence behavior, such as mental health status, substance abuse history post-arrest, and the nature of her employment.",
