The individual's age at first living arrangement with both biological parents in an urban area might suggest a low level of disruption or instability, but this factor alone does not outweigh the drug usage risk. The lack of college education (medium) is also considered as it may limit future employment and financial stability opportunities, increasing the likelihood of recidivism due to economic hardship. Both factors combined suggest a medium level of 3-year rearrest recidivism risk. However, the confidence level is high due to these significant risk factors.",
