Then, I'll use these factors to make a prediction about whether the individual is likely to be rearrested within 3 years.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n1. Demographic factors:\n   - Age: 22\n   - Ethnicity: White\n   - Height/weight: 6 feet 0 inches, 155 lbs\n\n2. Criminal history:\n   - Arrests: 1 time\n   - Convictions: None\n\n3. Social and educational status:\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Living situation: Alone\n   - Education: High school diploma + enrolled in 4-year college\n   - Employment: Held 1 job during the year\n\n4. Health and substance use:\n   - Drug use: None in past four years\n   - Depression: Not felt depressed over past month\n\n5. Family history:\n   - Lived with both biological parents at a young age\n   - Household size: 4\n\n6. Religious beliefs:\n   - Doesn't believe God influences personal life\n\nNow, let's evaluate each factor and assign weights:\n\n1. Demographic factors: Low risk\n2. Criminal history: Medium risk (one arrest but no conviction)\n3. Social and educational status: Low risk (stable education and employment)\n4. Health and substance use: Low risk (no recent drug use or depression)\n5. Family history: Low risk (stable family background)\n6. Religious beliefs: Unknown impact, so we'll consider it neutral\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the overall picture suggests a low to moderate risk profile for this individual. The lack of convictions, stable education and employment, absence of substance abuse, and positive family background all contribute to a lower risk assessment. However, the single arrest does introduce some uncertainty.\n</reflection>\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the prediction should be \"NO\" (not likely to be rearrested within 3 years) with a high confidence level.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is still young but not in the highest risk age range for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"neutral\", \"White ethnicity does not significantly impact recidivism risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not typically influence criminal behavior or recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Criminal history (arrests)\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction suggests some risk, but the lack of convictions mitigates it.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"neutral\", \"Never being married at 22 is common and doesn't significantly impact risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at this age is not uncommon and doesn't indicate increased risk.\"),\n    (\"Education and employment\", \"low\", \"Stable education path (high school diploma + college) and having held a job suggests stability.\"),\n    (\"Substance use history\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use significantly reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month is positive for overall well-being and risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with both biological parents at a young age is protective against higher risks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\n</output>",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
