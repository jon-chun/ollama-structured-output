    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this complex problem, I'll develop a step-by-step plan to analyze each factor, assign relative weights, and then use these assessments to make a prediction about the individual's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Here's my approach:\n\n1. Review all provided information systematically.\n2. Assign a risk weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on its potential impact on recidivism.\n3. Consider interactions between factors where relevant.\n4. Summarize the overall risk profile.\n5. Make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism based on the assessed factors.\n6. Estimate confidence in the prediction.\n\nLet's work through this plan:\n\n1. Review of information:\n   - Demographics: 20-year-old Hispanic female, unmarried\n   - Physical characteristics: 5'3\", 160 lbs\n   - Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n   - Employment: Held three jobs in the past year\n   - Substance use: None in past four years, occasional feelings of depression\n   - Family background: Lived in a household of four at a young age\n   - Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\n2. Assigning risk weights:\n\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"While not extremely high-risk, 20 is an age where criminal behavior can still be developing.\")\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being Hispanic doesn't inherently increase recidivism risk.\")\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Not being married at this age could contribute to instability.\")\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't typically correlate with criminal behavior.\")\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism risk.\")\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs in a year could indicate instability but also adaptability.\")\n    (\"Substance use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use and occasional depression feelings are relatively low risk.\")\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of four may have contributed to stress or resource scarcity.\")\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"This belief can provide stability but doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism.\")\n\n3. Considering interactions:\n   - Lack of education and multiple jobs could indicate instability.\n   - Absence of drug use despite occasional feelings of depression is a positive factor.\n\n4. Overall risk profile:\n   The individual has several medium-risk factors, one high-risk factor (education level), and mostly low-risk factors.\n\n5. Prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, I would predict \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism due to the presence of a significant high-risk factor (lack of education) coupled with multiple medium-risk factors.\n\n6. Confidence estimation:\n   Given the mixed profile but with some strong risk indicators, my confidence level is around 60%.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive and well-reasoned. The use of both quantitative and qualitative factors provides a balanced view. However, it's important to note that criminal recidivism prediction is complex and subject to various external influences not captured in this assessment. Additionally, the lack of specific offense information or prior behavioral patterns could affect accuracy.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"While not extremely high-risk, 20 is an age where criminal behavior can still be developing.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being Hispanic doesn't inherently increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Not being married at this age could contribute to instability.\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't typically correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs in a year could indicate instability but also adaptability.\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use and occasional depression feelings are relatively low risk.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of four may have contributed to stress or resource scarcity.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"This belief can provide stability but doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n</output>",
