    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze each piece of information provided about the individual and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict the likelihood of rearrest recidivism within three years.\n\nLet's go through each factor systematically:\n\n1. Demographics:\n   - Age: 21 years old\n   - Race: White\n\n2. Criminal history:\n   - Arrests: 3 times\n   - Convictions: At least one (mentioned as convicted)\n\n3. Physical characteristics:\n   - Height: 5 feet 11 inches\n   - Weight: 135 lbs\n\n4. Family and living situation:\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Living arrangement: Not alone\n\n5. Education and employment:\n   - Educational attainment: No high school diploma or GED certificate\n   - College enrollment: Not enrolled\n   - Employment history: Held 3 jobs in the past year\n\n6. Substance use:\n   - Drug use: Used marijuana in the past four years\n\n7. Mental health:\n   - Depression: Has not felt depressed over the past month\n\n8. Family background:\n   - Childhood living situation: Lived with biological mother\n   - Household size at a young age: 2\n   - Urban vs. rural: Grew up in an urban area\n\n9. Religious beliefs:\n   - Belief in divine influence on personal life: Yes\n\nNow, let's assign weights and provide reasoning for each factor:\n\n1. Age (medium): While still relatively young, not extremely high risk.\n2. Race (low): No specific information indicates race as a significant factor here.\n3. Arrest history (high): Three arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n4. Conviction history (high): Being convicted suggests more serious offenses or repeated crimes.\n5. Height and weight (low): Physical characteristics are not typically strong predictors.\n6. Marital status (medium): Never married could indicate instability but is common at 21.\n7. Living arrangement (medium): Not living alone might suggest some level of support.\n8. Education (high): Lack of high school diploma or GED increases risk factors.\n9. Employment history (medium): Holding multiple jobs suggests adaptability but also instability.\n10. Substance use (medium): Marijuana use is common, especially in young adults, but still a risk factor.\n11. Mental health (low): No recent depression reported reduces this as a risk factor.\n12. Childhood living situation (high): Small household with biological mother might indicate limited support or resources.\n13. Urban upbringing (high): Growing up in an urban area can increase exposure to crime and risky behaviors.\n14. Religious beliefs (low): Belief in divine influence doesn't typically correlate strongly with criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's consider these factors collectively:\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while some factors are medium or low risk, the cumulative effect of several high-risk factors (arrest history, conviction history, lack of education, and urban upbringing) suggests a higher overall risk. Additionally, the age and employment instability contribute to an increased likelihood of recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\nGiven this analysis, I would predict that the individual is likely to be rearrested within three years.\n\n<reflection>\nThis prediction aligns with the high-risk factors identified. The confidence level should reflect the balance between strong predictors (arrest history, convictions) and less significant ones (age, employment). Let's set the confidence at 70%, as while there are several concerning indicators, some factors like recent mental health status mitigate the risk slightly.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"While still young, not extremely high risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"No specific information indicates race as a significant factor here\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"Three arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Conviction history\", \"high\", \"Being convicted suggests more serious offenses or repeated crimes\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not typically strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married could indicate instability but is common at 21 years old\"),\n    (\"Living arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone might suggest some level of support or supervision\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED increases risk factors for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs suggests adaptability but also instability in employment\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common, especially in young adults, but still a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reported reduces this as a risk factor\"),\n    (\"Childhood living situation\", \"high\", \"Small household with biological mother might indicate limited support or resources during formative years\"),\n    (\"Urban upbringing\", \"high\", \"Growing up in an urban area can increase exposure to crime and risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence doesn't typically correlate strongly with criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
