    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine its relative weight (low, medium, high) based on the given information. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze each piece of information as a potential risk factor\n2. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor\n3. Use these weighted factors to make an overall prediction\n\nLet's go through the information:\n\n1. Age: 22 years old - Medium risk (young adulthood is associated with higher crime rates)\n2. Race: White - Low risk (race alone isn't a strong predictor of recidivism)\n3. Arrest history: 2 arrests, 1 conviction - Medium to High risk (multiple arrests indicate repeated criminal behavior)\n4. Physical characteristics: 5'8\", 145 lbs - Low risk (physical attributes aren't strongly correlated with recidivism)\n5. Marital status: Never married - Low to Medium risk (single status may increase social isolation)\n6. Living situation: Currently living alone - Medium risk (social isolation can be a risk factor)\n7. Education: Completed Bachelor's, enrolled in 4-year college - Low risk (higher education is associated with lower recidivism rates)\n8. Employment history: Held 1 job in the past year - High risk (unstable employment patterns are strongly correlated with recidivism)\n9. Substance use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years - Medium to High risk (drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism)\n10. Mental health: No depression in the past month - Low risk (absence of recent mental health issues reduces recidivism risk)\n11. Family background: Lived with both biological parents as a child, household size 4 - Low risk (stable family environment is protective against recidivism)\n12. Religious beliefs: Believes God influences personal events - Low to Medium risk (spirituality can have mixed effects on criminal behavior)\n\nNow, let's use these weighted factors to make an overall prediction:\n\n<reflection>\nReviewing the analysis, it appears that there are both positive and negative factors in this individual's profile. The most concerning factors are:\n- Multiple arrests and conviction history\n- Substance use\n- Unstable employment\n\nHowever, we also have protective factors such as higher education and a stable family background.\n\nGiven these mixed signals, I need to carefully consider the overall risk assessment.\n</reflection>\n\nAfter careful consideration of all factors, it seems that while there are some positive aspects to this individual's profile, the presence of multiple arrests, substance use, and unstable employment history outweighs the protective factors. These negative indicators suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nLet me double-check my reasoning:\n- The person has demonstrated repeated criminal behavior with two arrests.\n- Substance use is known to be strongly associated with increased recidivism risk.\n- Unstable employment patterns are also highly predictive of recidivism.\nWhile education and family background are positive factors, they may not be enough to overcome these strong negative indicators.\n\nThis analysis aligns with the conclusion that the individual has a higher risk of rearrest within three years.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this careful consideration of all factors, I believe the most accurate prediction is that this individual will likely experience recidivism within the next three years.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"Young adulthood is associated with higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"Low\", \"Race alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"High\", \"Multiple arrests indicate repeated criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"Low\", \"Physical attributes are not strongly correlated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"Medium\", \"Single status may increase social isolation\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"Medium\", \"Social isolation can be a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"Low\", \"Higher education is associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"High\", \"Unstable employment patterns are strongly correlated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"High\", \"Drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"Low\", \"Absence of recent mental health issues reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"Low\", \"Stable family environment is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"Medium\", \"Spirituality can have mixed effects on criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n</output>",
