    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nThis is a complex task that requires careful analysis of various risk factors to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years. I'll need to develop a step-by-step plan to evaluate each factor and then combine them for an overall prediction.\n\nPlan:\n1. Evaluate demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity)\n2. Assess criminal history\n3. Analyze physical characteristics\n4. Examine family background and current living situation\n5. Evaluate education and employment status\n6. Consider substance use and mental health indicators\n7. Review early life experiences and religious beliefs\n8. Assign weights to each factor (low, medium, high)\n9. Combine the factors for an overall prediction\n10. Determine confidence level\n\nLet's work through this plan using Chain of Thought reasoning:\n\n1. Demographic factors:\n   - Age: 19 (medium risk) - young adult age often associated with higher crime rates\n   - Gender: Female (low risk) - generally lower recidivism rates for women\n   - Ethnicity: White (neutral)\n\n2. Criminal history:\n   - Arrested once, no convictions (medium risk) - indicates some involvement in criminal activity\n\n3. Physical characteristics:\n   - Height and weight (neutral) - not typically significant factors in recidivism prediction\n\n4. Family background and living situation:\n   - Lived with both biological parents at a young age (low risk) - stable family environment\n   - Currently lives alone (medium risk) - may indicate lack of support network or supervision\n\n5. Education and employment:\n   - GED certificate, not in college (medium risk) - limited educational attainment\n   - Held one job in the past year (neutral to medium risk) - some employment history but potentially unstable\n\n6. Substance use and mental health:\n   - Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years (high risk) - substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism\n   - Felt depressed most days recently (medium to high risk) - untreated mental health issues can increase crime likelihood\n\n7. Early life experiences and religious beliefs:\n   - Lived in an urban area as a child (neutral to medium risk) - may have been exposed to more crime-prone environments\n   - Believes God has something to do with personal outcomes (low risk) - may indicate a sense of moral accountability or support\n\n8. Assigning weights:\n    \"age\": 19, \"weight\": \"medium\", \"reason\": \"Young adult age often associated with higher crime rates\"\n    \"gender\": \"Female\", \"weight\": \"low\", \"reason\": \"Generally lower recidivism rates for women\"\n    \"ethnicity\": \"White\", \"weight\": \"neutral\", \"reason\": \"No significant risk factor in this context\"\n    \"arrest_history\": \"Arrested once, no convictions\", \"weight\": \"medium\", \"reason\": \"Indicates some involvement in criminal activity but not severe enough to be convicted\"\n    \"physical_characteristics\": \"5 feet 4 inches, 110 lbs\", \"weight\": \"neutral\", \"reason\": \"Not typically significant factors in recidivism prediction\"\n    \"family_background\": \"Lived with both biological parents at a young age\", \"weight\": \"low\", \"reason\": \"Stable family environment\"\n    \"living_situation\": \"Currently lives alone\", \"weight\": \"medium\", \"reason\": \"May indicate lack of support network or supervision\"\n    \"education\": \"GED certificate, not in college\", \"weight\": \"medium\", \"reason\": \"Limited educational attainment but has some certification\"\n    \"employment\": \"Held one job in the past year\", \"weight\": \"neutral to medium\", \"reason\": \"Some employment history but potentially unstable\"\n    \"substance_use\": \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\", \"weight\": \"high\", \"reason\": \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism\"\n    \"mental_health\": \"Felt depressed most days recently\", \"weight\": \"medium to high\", \"reason\": \"Untreated mental health issues can increase crime likelihood\"\n    \"early_life_experiences\": \"Lived in an urban area as a child\", \"weight\": \"neutral to medium\", \"reason\": \"May have been exposed to more crime-prone environments\"\n    \"religious_beliefs\": \"Believes God has something to do with personal outcomes\", \"weight\": \"low\", \"reason\": \"May indicate a sense of moral accountability or support\"\n\n9. Combining factors for overall prediction:\n   Based on the analysis, there are several high and medium risk factors that outweigh the low risk factors. The substance use history is particularly concerning as it's a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\n10. Determining confidence level:\n   Given the mix of risk factors, especially the significant ones like substance abuse and depression, I would assign a moderate to high confidence level for rearrest within three years.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive but could be improved by considering potential interactions between factors (e.g., how substance use might affect mental health or employment stability). Additionally, more specific data on the severity of drug use and depression symptoms would strengthen the assessment. However, with the given information, the current evaluation provides a reasonable basis for prediction.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adult age often associated with higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Generally lower recidivism rates for women\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"neutral\", \"No significant risk factor in this context\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Indicates some involvement in criminal activity but not severe enough to be convicted\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"neutral\", \"Not typically significant factors in recidivism prediction\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"May indicate lack of support network or supervision\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Limited educational attainment but has some certification\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"neutral to medium\", \"Some employment history but potentially unstable\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium to high\", \"Untreated mental health issues can increase crime likelihood\"),\n    (\"early_life_experiences\", \"neutral to medium\", \"May have been exposed to more crime-prone environments\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"May indicate a sense of moral accountability or support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
