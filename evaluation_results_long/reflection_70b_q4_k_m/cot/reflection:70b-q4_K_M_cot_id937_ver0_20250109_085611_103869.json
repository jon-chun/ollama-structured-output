    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) based on its potential impact on recidivism. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict the likelihood of rearrest within 3 years.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n\n1. Analyze each given factor\n2. Assign a risk level (low, medium, high) and provide reasoning for each factor\n3. Collectively evaluate all factors to make a prediction\n4. Determine the confidence in this prediction\n\nLet's go through each factor:\n\n1. Age: 19 years old - Medium risk\n   Reasoning: While young adults are generally at higher risk of recidivism, 19 is not extremely young.\n\n2. Race: White - Low risk (no specific correlation with recidivism)\n\n3. Arrest history: 2 arrests, 1 conviction - High risk\n   Reasoning: Previous arrest and conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\n4. Physical attributes: 5'6\", 125-149 lbs - Low risk (physical attributes not strongly correlated with recidivism)\n\n5. Marital status: Married, living with spouse - Medium risk\n   Reasoning: While being married can be stabilizing, it's also young for marriage and may indicate impulsivity.\n\n6. Education: No high school diploma or GED - High risk\n   Reasoning: Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\n7. Employment history: Held 1 job in the past year - Medium risk\n   Reasoning: Some employment history, but not stable or extensive.\n\n8. Drug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years - High risk\n   Reasoning: Recent drug use is strongly correlated with higher recidivism rates.\n\n9. Mental health: Felt depressed most of last month - Medium to High risk\n   Reasoning: Depression can increase recidivism risk, but not as strongly as other factors here.\n\n10. Childhood environment: Lived with biological mother in rural area - Low to Medium risk\n    Reasoning: While not ideal, this doesn't indicate extreme adversity or neglect.\n\n11. Religious beliefs: Believes God has something to do with personal events - Low risk\n    Reasoning: This belief could potentially be stabilizing but is not strongly correlated with recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter reviewing the analysis, it appears comprehensive and well-reasoned. Each factor has been considered based on its potential impact on recidivism. The reasoning provided explains why each factor was assigned a particular risk level. No major factors seem to have been overlooked.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's collectivly evaluate these factors for prediction:\n\n<reflection>\nConsidering all the factors collectively:\n- There are several high-risk factors (arrest history, education, drug use)\n- A few medium-risk factors (age, marital status, employment history, mental health)\n- Most other factors are low risk or neutral\n\nThe overall profile suggests a moderate to high risk of recidivism. However, the presence of some stabilizing factors (marriage, religious beliefs) and relatively young age might temper this slightly.\n</reflection>\n\nPrediction: Likely YES for rearrest within 3 years\nConfidence: 80%\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"While young adults are generally at higher risk of recidivism, 19 is not extremely young.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"Low\", \"No specific correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"High\", \"Previous arrest and conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Physical attributes\", \"Low\", \"Not strongly correlated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"Medium\", \"Being married can be stabilizing, but it's also young for marriage and may indicate impulsivity\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"High\", \"Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"Medium\", \"Some employment history, but not stable or extensive\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"High\", \"Recent drug use is strongly correlated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"High\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Childhood environment\", \"Low to Medium\", \"While not ideal, this doesn't indicate extreme adversity or neglect\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"Low\", \"This belief could potentially be stabilizing but is not strongly correlated with recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
