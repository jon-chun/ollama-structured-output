    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided and assess its relevance to the risk of rearrest recidivism. Then, I'll assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on my analysis. Finally, I'll use these factors collectively to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nLet's break this down step-by-step:\n\n1. Analyze demographic information\n2. Assess criminal history\n3. Evaluate employment and education status\n4. Consider substance use and mental health\n5. Look at family background and living situation\n6. Examine personal beliefs\n7. Assign relative weights to each factor\n8. Use the weighted factors to make a prediction\n\nLet's go through each step:\n\n1. Demographic information:\n   - Age: 21 (relatively young, could be a risk factor)\n   - Race: Black (may face systemic biases in law enforcement)\n   - Height and weight: Average (not particularly relevant)\n\n2. Criminal history:\n   - Arrested 3 times with no convictions\n   This suggests multiple interactions with the justice system without official penalties.\n\n3. Employment and education status:\n   - GED certificate (lower educational attainment compared to a high school diploma)\n   - Three jobs in the past year (high job turnover, potential instability)\n\n4. Substance use and mental health:\n   - Past marijuana use\n   - Current feelings of depression\n\n5. Family background and living situation:\n   - Never married, not living alone (potential lack of stability)\n\n6. Personal beliefs:\n   - Believes God has something to do with personal life events\n\n7. Assigning relative weights:\n\na) Age: medium risk\nb) Race: low-medium risk\nc) Height/weight: low risk\nd) Criminal history: high risk\ne) Education (GED): medium-high risk\nf) Employment instability: high risk\ng) Substance use: medium risk\nh) Mental health issues: medium-high risk\ni) Family background/living situation: medium risk\nj) Personal beliefs: low risk\n\n8. Making a prediction:\n\nBased on these factors, the individual appears to have several high-risk indicators for rearrest recidivism:\n- Multiple arrests without convictions (suggesting potential ongoing illegal activity)\n- High job turnover and lower educational attainment\n- Substance use and mental health issues\n- Young age and lack of stable living situation\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, I realize that while race may face systemic biases in law enforcement, it's not a direct personal risk factor for recidivism. Therefore, I should downweight this factor to \"low\" rather than \"low-medium.\" Additionally, the belief in God's influence on life events doesn't seem to be strongly related to criminal behavior and can be considered more of a protective factor or neutral at worst.\n\nLet me adjust these factors:\na) Race: low risk\nb) Personal beliefs: low (potentially protective)\n\nWith this adjustment, the overall picture still suggests a high likelihood of rearrest recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict that this individual has a high chance of being rearrested within 3 years. The confidence level for this prediction would be around 75%.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21)\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"Race (Black)\", \"low\", \"May face systemic biases, but not a direct personal risk factor\"),\n    (\"Height and weight (5'9\\\" 170 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Average physical characteristics, not particularly relevant to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Criminal history (3 arrests, no convictions)\", \"high\", \"Multiple interactions with justice system without official penalties\"),\n    (\"Education status (GED certificate)\", \"medium-high\", \"Lower educational attainment compared to high school diploma\"),\n    (\"Employment stability (3 jobs in the past year)\", \"high\", \"High job turnover suggests instability\"),\n    (\"Substance use (past marijuana use)\", \"medium\", \"Previous drug use can be a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Mental health issues (current feelings of depression)\", \"medium-high\", \"Depression can increase risk of problematic behaviors\"),\n    (\"Family background and living situation (never married, not living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Potential lack of stability in personal life\"),\n    (\"Personal beliefs (believes God influences personal events)\", \"low\", \"May provide a sense of purpose or moral guidance\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n</output>",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area.
