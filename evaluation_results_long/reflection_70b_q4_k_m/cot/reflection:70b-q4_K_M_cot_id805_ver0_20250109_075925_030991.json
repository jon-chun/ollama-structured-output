    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided about the individual and assess its potential impact on recidivism risk. Then, I'll use this analysis to make a prediction about whether he will be rearrested within 3 years. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Create a list of all factors mentioned\n2. Analyze each factor for its potential impact on recidivism\n3. Assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each factor based on the analysis\n4. Combine these weighted factors to make a prediction\n\nLet's go through this process:\n\n1. List of factors:\n   - Age: 22-year-old male\n   - Race: White\n   - Arrest history: 2 arrests, 1 conviction\n   - Physical characteristics: 5'10\", 170 lbs\n   - Marital status: Never married\n   - Living situation: Currently living alone\n   - Education: High school diploma, enrolled in 4-year college\n   - Employment history: Held 4 jobs during the year\n   - Drug use: No drug use past 4 years, occasional feelings of depression\n   - Upbringing: Lived with both biological parents, household size 5, urban area\n   - Religious beliefs: Believes God has a role in personal life\n\n2. Analysis and risk assessment:\n\n   Age (22): Medium - Young adults are at higher risk for recidivism\n   Race (White): Low - No clear evidence of race being a significant factor in this case\n   Arrest history: High - Previous arrests and conviction increase recidivism risk\n   Physical characteristics: Low - No significant correlation with recidivism\n   Marital status: Medium - Never married individuals may have less stability\n   Living situation: Medium - Living alone can be a risk factor for instability\n   Education: Low - Currently in college, suggesting positive engagement\n   Employment history: High - Frequent job changes may indicate instability\n   Drug use: Low - No drug use and occasional feelings of depression are not major red flags\n   Upbringing: Low - Stable family environment as a child is generally positive\n   Religious beliefs: Low - Belief in God can be stabilizing, but it's hard to quantify\n\n3. Weighted factors:\n   - Age (medium)\n   - Arrest history (high)\n   - Marital status (medium)\n   - Living situation (medium)\n   - Employment history (high)\n\n4. Combining factors and making a prediction:\n\n<reflection>\nAfter analyzing all the factors, I notice that while there are some positive indicators (education, stable upbringing, belief in God), there are also several significant risk factors:\n- Previous arrest and conviction history\n- Young age\n- Never married status\n- Living alone\n- Frequent job changes\n\nThese factors seem to outweigh the positive ones. However, it's important to note that the individual is currently enrolled in college, which suggests some level of stability and forward thinking.\n\nGiven these considerations, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within 3 years due to the accumulation of risk factors.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"At 22, this individual is in a high-risk age group for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"Previous arrests and conviction significantly increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married individuals may have less stability in their personal lives\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone can contribute to instability\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes indicate potential issues with stability and responsibility\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n</output>",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
