    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I need to analyze each piece of information provided about the individual and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor. Then, I'll use these factors to predict the likelihood of rearrest recidivism within three years.\n\nLet's break down the information and assess each factor:\n\n1. Demographics:\n   - Age: 21\n   - Race: White\n   - Height and weight: 6'11\" and 220 lbs\n\n2. Criminal history:\n   - Arrested once, no convictions\n\n3. Social status:\n   - Never married\n   - Living alone\n\n4. Education:\n   - High school diploma\n   - Not enrolled in college\n\n5. Employment:\n   - No jobs held in the past year\n\n6. Substance use and mental health:\n   - Used marijuana in the past four years\n   - No depression reported in the past month\n\n7. Family background:\n   - Lived with both biological parents at a young age\n   - Household size: 6 people\n   - Urban area\n\n8. Religious beliefs:\n   - Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nNow, let's assign weights and reasons for each factor:\n\n1. Demographics: Medium risk\n   Reason: While being younger (21) is generally associated with higher crime rates, the specific age alone isn't strongly predictive.\n\n2. Criminal history: High risk\n   Reason: Previous arrest indicates potential involvement in illegal activities or risky behavior.\n\n3. Social status: Low risk\n   Reason: Being unmarried and living alone doesn't significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\n\n4. Education: Medium risk\n   Reason: Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities.\n\n5. Employment: High risk\n   Reason: No jobs in the past year indicates instability or lack of engagement in productive activities.\n\n6. Substance use and mental health: Low-Medium risk\n   Reason: Past marijuana use isn't strongly predictive, and no recent depression is a positive factor.\n\n7. Family background: Low risk\n   Reason: Stable family environment (both biological parents) at a young age is generally protective against criminal behavior.\n\n8. Religious beliefs: Low risk\n   Reason: Belief in divine influence can provide a moral framework that discourages criminal activity.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter reviewing the analysis, it appears comprehensive and considers all provided factors. The reasoning for each factor seems logical and aligns with general criminological research findings. However, I should double-check if any important connections between factors were missed.\n</reflection>\n\nReflecting on the overall picture:\n- High-risk factors: Criminal history (arrest), employment status (no jobs)\n- Medium-risk factors: Demographics (age), education\n- Low-risk factors: Social status, substance use/mental health, family background, religious beliefs\n\nThe high-risk factors outweigh the low and medium ones, suggesting a higher likelihood of rearrest recidivism.\n\n<reflection>\nAfter this reflection, I believe the analysis is complete. The assigned weights and reasoning appear to capture the individual's risk profile comprehensively.\n</reflection>\n\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"At 21 years old, the individual falls within a higher-risk age group for criminal behavior but isn't extremely young.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"High\", \"Previous arrest indicates involvement in illegal activities or risky behavior despite no convictions\"),\n    (\"Social Status\", \"Low\", \"Being unmarried and living alone doesn't significantly contribute to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"Medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"High\", \"No jobs in the past year indicates instability or lack of engagement in productive activities\"),\n    (\"Substance Use and Mental Health\", \"Low-Medium\", \"Past marijuana use isn't strongly predictive, and no recent depression is a positive factor\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"Low\", \"Stable family environment at a young age is generally protective against criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"Low\", \"Belief in divine influence can provide a moral framework that discourages criminal activity\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n</output>",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 11 inches and weighs 220 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
