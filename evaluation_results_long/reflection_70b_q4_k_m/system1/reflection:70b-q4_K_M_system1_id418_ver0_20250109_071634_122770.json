    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 82\n}\n\n<reflection>\nLet's review the analysis:\n1. Age: 20 is considered young and may indicate higher risk due to impulsivity.\n2. Ethnicity: Asian/Pacific Islander doesn't typically correlate with high crime rates in most studies.\n3. Arrest history: One arrest without conviction suggests some involvement in risky behavior.\n4. Physical attributes: Small stature and low weight don't typically indicate high risk.\n5. Marital status: Never married is common for 20-year-olds but may indicate lack of stability.\n6. Education: High school diploma only may limit job opportunities and increase frustration.\n7. Employment: Holding one job in a year could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\n8. Drug use: Recent use of marijuana and cocaine suggests potential for addiction issues.\n9. Mental health: No recent depression is positive, but past drug use may be linked to mental health issues.\n10. Family background: Large household size (8) at a young age may have led to less individual attention or more stress.\n11. Religious beliefs: Belief in divine intervention could indicate lack of personal responsibility.\n\nThe prediction of \"YES\" with 82% confidence seems appropriate given these factors. The drug use, employment instability, and potential issues stemming from family background appear to outweigh the positive aspects such as no recent depression and belief in God's influence.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\nBased on a comprehensive analysis of the provided risk factors, I predict that this individual is at high risk for future criminal behavior. My confidence level in this prediction is 82%.\n\nThis assessment takes into account several key indicators:\n\n1. The individual's young age (20) suggests impulsivity and potential lack of fully developed decision-making skills.\n2. Despite only one arrest without conviction, the fact that he has been arrested at all indicates some involvement with law enforcement and potentially risky behavior.\n3. His limited educational attainment (only a high school diploma) and not being enrolled in college may lead to frustration or difficulty finding stable employment opportunities.\n4. The recent use of drugs such as marijuana and cocaine raises concerns about potential addiction issues and the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity to support drug habits.\n\nWhile there are some positive factors, such as no recent depression and a belief in divine intervention (which could indicate a moral framework), these do not outweigh the more significant risk indicators. The individual's employment instability (holding only one job during the year) and living situation (alone at 20) may also contribute to a higher risk profile.\n\nIt's important to note that this assessment is based on statistical patterns rather than individual circumstances. Many people with similar profiles do not engage in criminal behavior, and external factors such as supportive networks or interventions can significantly impact an individual's likelihood of future criminal involvement.\n</output>",
