The high number of arrests before adulthood and substance use are major indicators of potential recidivism. While some factors like education status, employment history, and mental health issues also contribute to the risk, they're not as severe in this case. The overall assessment suggests a higher likelihood of 3-year rearrest recidivism for this individual.\n\n</output>",
