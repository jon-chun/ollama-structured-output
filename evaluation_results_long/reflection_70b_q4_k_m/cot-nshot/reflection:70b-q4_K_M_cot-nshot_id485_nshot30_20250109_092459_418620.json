    "raw_message_text": "After careful analysis of the given examples and the specific case provided, I have conducted a comprehensive risk factor assessment. Here's my prediction for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome based on this evaluation:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years)\", \"low\", \"Young age is generally associated with higher crime rates due to impulsivity and less life experience, but being at the lower end of the adult range mitigates this factor slightly.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"First-time offenders are less likely to recidivate than those with multiple arrests or convictions, but still represent a risk.\"),\n    (\"Average height and weight (5'9\" - 150-174 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics generally have minimal impact on rearrest likelihood unless extremely unusual or relevant to specific crimes.\"),\n    (\"Marital status: never married\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried individuals may have fewer social constraints, potentially increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Absence of immediate family supervision could increase opportunities for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Currently enrolled in school\", \"low\", \"Engagement in education is generally a positive factor reducing recidivism likelihood by providing structure and alternative goals.\"),\n    (\"Single job held during the year\", \"medium\", \"Some employment history but lack of stability may indicate difficulties with commitment or responsibility.\"),\n    (\"Past drug use (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use, even for less severe substances like marijuana, is strongly associated with increased recidivism risk due to addiction and lifestyle factors.\"),\n    (\"Recent depression symptoms\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase criminal behavior likelihood but may also indicate a desire for help and potential for intervention.\"),\n    (\"Household size at young age (4 people)\", \"low\", \"Average household size, neither particularly stable nor unstable, with minimal impact on rearrest likelihood.\"),\n    (\"No belief in divine influence\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious beliefs has been associated with slightly higher recidivism rates, possibly due to reduced social control or moral framework.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on a balanced consideration of the provided risk factors. While there are several medium and high-risk factors present (such as single arrest without conviction, recent depression symptoms, past drug use, living alone, and lack of belief in divine influence), these are offset by positive factors like current enrollment in school and relatively stable demographic characteristics.\n\nThe high-risk factor of past drug use is particularly concerning, but the individual's current engagement in education suggests a potential for positive change. The lack of severe criminal history (only one arrest without conviction) also weighs against predicting rearrest recidivism.\n\nGiven these considerations, while there are significant risks present, the overall profile leans slightly more towards not recidivating within three years, primarily due to factors indicating some stability and potential for positive growth (education enrollment, single job held). However, it's important to note that drug use remains a high-risk factor that warrants intervention and support.\n\nThe confidence level of 72% reflects both the complexity of this case and the presence of conflicting risk indicators. This assessment suggests that while there are compelling reasons to believe recidivism may be avoided, there is still significant room for uncertainty due to the individual's drug use history and other medium-risk factors.\n</output>",
