    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Age and Gender (22-year-old male): Generally, younger individuals have a lower likelihood of high-risk criminal behavior compared to older adults. Being male does not inherently increase risk; however, the context of past arrests indicates potential for future risky actions.\n\n2. Criminal History (1 arrest and 1 conviction): A single arrest and conviction do not necessarily indicate a high-risk individual. The nature of these offenses is crucial to consider. If they were non-violent or minor crimes, the risk might be lower.\n\n3. Education: Holding a college enrollment suggests a level of ambition and potential for future contribution to society rather than detriment.\n\n4. Employment History (none): Unemployment is not inherently risky, but it may indicate instability or lack of motivation, which could be considered when evaluating overall risk.\n\n5. Physical Health: The individual's weight and height suggest a healthy adult, without any overt signs of physical health issues that would increase risk.\n\n6. Living Situation (living alone): This could indicate independence but does not necessarily imply increased risk. It depends on the context of his living arrangements.\n\n7. Substance Use: Past marijuana use is less concerning than other substances, and there's no indication of current problematic use or addiction.\n\n8. Mental Health (no depression): Absence of recent depression suggests an emotional stability that could mitigate risk.\n\n9. Family Background (lived with both biological parents in a large household in urban area at a young age, now considers divine influence): This suggests a relatively stable upbringing, which generally correlates with lower criminal risks.\n\n10. Spirituality: Belief in divine influence is not a risk factor; it indicates a personal philosophy rather than behavioral inclination towards crime.\n\nGiven these factors, while some do carry potential indicators of higher risk (e.g., criminal history), the overall profile suggests moderate to low-risk due to educational pursuits, lack of substance abuse issues, and a stable background. The confidence level is set at 80% as it's a nuanced assessment balancing both positive and negative risk indicators.",
