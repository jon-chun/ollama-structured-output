She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 138 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
