Here is the rationale:\n\n- **Age and Gender:** Being a young adult female, she falls into a demographic statistically less associated with high recidivism rates compared to older males.\n  \n- **Criminal Record:** She has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating no confirmed pattern of criminal activity.\n\n- **Education and Employment:** Having completed high school and held multiple jobs indicates stability and engagement in lawful activities.\n\n- **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use for four years and absence of depression over the past month suggest positive lifestyle choices and mental health status.\n\n- **Family and Personal Beliefs:** Growing up in a family unit with both biological parents, despite being in an urban area, might have provided some level of stability. Her belief system (disconnection from religious influence) does not inherently indicate risk.\n\nOverall, these factors collectively point towards a low likelihood of future criminal behavior, supporting the \"NO\" prediction with high confidence. However, there is always room for unforeseen variables that could alter this assessment, thus an 85% confidence level rather than absolute certainty.",
