Additionally, socio-economic challenges such as lack of education (no high school diploma or GED), limited employment stability (only one job in the past year), living situation (unmarried, living alone), and potential mental health concerns (feelings of severe depression) contribute to an elevated risk profile. The individual's expressed detachment from religious beliefs might also reflect a lack of supportive community networks that could mitigate these risks. While these factors suggest a higher risk, the absence of recent drug use and limited criminal history provide some counterbalance, hence the confidence level is set at 75 rather than closer to 100.",
