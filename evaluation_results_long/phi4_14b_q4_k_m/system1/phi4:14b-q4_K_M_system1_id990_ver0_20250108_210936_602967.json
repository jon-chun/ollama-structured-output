This alone doesn't indicate high risk for future offenses.\n\n- **Education and Employment:** Enrollment in school and holding two jobs suggest stability and commitment to personal development, which are positive indicators.\n\n- **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a concern but not necessarily indicative of ongoing or escalating risk, especially without current use.\n\n- **Mental Health:** No recent depression suggests stable mental health in the short term.\n\n- **Family Background:** Growing up in a household with her biological mother may present typical familial challenges, but no specific high-risk factors are noted.\n\n- **Religious Belief:** A lack of personal belief in God's influence doesn't inherently correlate with criminal behavior risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas of concern (e.g., past drug use), the majority of indicators suggest a lower risk level. The confidence is set at 75 due to limited information on current behaviors and social support systems.",
