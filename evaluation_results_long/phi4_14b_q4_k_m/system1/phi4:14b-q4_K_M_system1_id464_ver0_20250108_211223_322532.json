    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n``` \n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Age and Demographics:** The individual is a young adult, which statistically correlates with higher risk due to impulsivity and lack of life experience. However, this alone isn't sufficient for high-risk determination.\n\n2. **Criminal History:** He has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating no significant criminal behavior or pattern that would suggest recidivism or ongoing legal issues.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics:** Height and weight are typical and do not inherently contribute to risk factors in a statistical model.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Being unmarried and living alone are neutral factors; they neither significantly increase nor decrease risk based on current models.\n\n5. **Education and Employment:** Enrollment in school and holding a job demonstrate engagement with society, reducing perceived risk of re-offending or antisocial behavior.\n\n6. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use for four years and no recent depression are positive indicators that reduce risk factors related to substance abuse and mental health issues.\n\n7. **Family Background:** Growing up in an urban household with both biological parents is a stable background, which generally correlates with lower risk compared to those from unstable or broken homes.\n\n8. **Religious Belief:** His belief that God has no personal involvement doesn't directly affect risk assessment unless it translates into behavior that could be considered risky.\n\nOverall, the lack of negative indicators such as substance abuse, mental health issues, repeated criminal activity, and engagement in education and employment suggest a lower risk profile.",
