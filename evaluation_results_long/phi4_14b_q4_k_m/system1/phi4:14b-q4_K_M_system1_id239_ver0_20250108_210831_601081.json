Currently living alone can indicate potential social isolation.\n\n8. **Religious Beliefs:** A belief that God has nothing to do with personal happenings may suggest a lack of spiritual or community support, which can be protective factors against risk.\n\n**Confidence Level:**\nThe confidence is set at 75 due to the presence of multiple moderate risk factors, but without conviction history or recent mental health issues, there are mitigating elements that prevent a higher certainty.",
