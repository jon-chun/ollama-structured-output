An arrest without conviction is less indicative of ongoing criminal behavior compared to multiple convictions or recent arrests.\n\n3. **Substance Use**: Past use of marijuana and cocaine suggests potential substance abuse issues, which can be a risk factor. However, there's no indication of current use or escalation in severity.\n\n4. **Mental Health**: He has not felt depressed over the past month, suggesting stable mental health at this time.\n\n5. **Social and Economic Factors**:\n   - Never married and living alone may indicate limited social support but is not inherently a risk factor.\n   - Employment history shows some stability (2 jobs in the year), which can be a mitigating factor against financial instability.\n\n6. **Family Background**: Grew up with both biological parents, which often correlates with better developmental outcomes compared to more disrupted family environments.\n\n7. **Beliefs and Attitudes**: Belief that God has something to do with personal events can suggest some level of optimism or resilience.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile there are some risk factors (substance use history, being a young male), the overall profile does not strongly indicate high risk for future negative outcomes without additional concerning behaviors or patterns. The confidence is set at 75 due to some mitigating factors and lack of recent problematic behavior.",
