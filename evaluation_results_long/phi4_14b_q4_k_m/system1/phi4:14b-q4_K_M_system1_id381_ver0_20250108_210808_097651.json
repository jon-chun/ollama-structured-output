The reported drug use is relatively minor (marijuana), and while there are some signs of potential mental health concerns (feeling down), these factors alone do not indicate a high risk for future criminal behavior. However, the presence of any risk factors means that this assessment cannot be made with absolute certainty. Therefore, a confidence level of 75 is provided to reflect moderate certainty in the \"NO\" prediction.",
