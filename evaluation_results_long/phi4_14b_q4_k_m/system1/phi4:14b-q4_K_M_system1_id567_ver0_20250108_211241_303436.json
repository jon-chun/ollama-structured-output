A single arrest without conviction does not significantly indicate high risk.\n\n3. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Being married and living with a spouse generally suggests stability, which is a mitigating factor against high risk.\n\n4. **Education and Employment:** Lack of a high school diploma or GED may be considered a risk factor; however, holding two jobs during the year indicates some level of responsibility and engagement in society.\n\n5. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators that lower perceived risk.\n\n6. **Family Background:** Growing up in a rural area with his biological mother in a household of size 3 does not inherently indicate high risk, especially without additional negative factors.\n\n7. **Religious Belief:** The belief that God has something to do with personal outcomes can be seen as providing psychological resilience and support, which may lower risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential risk factors (age, lack of education), the positive indicators (marital status, employment, no substance use) suggest a moderate-to-low risk. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" for high risk with a confidence level of 75%.",
