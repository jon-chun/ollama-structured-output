    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Age and Demographics**: At 18 years old, the individual is still considered young in terms of criminal history. Youth can be a risk factor due to impulsive behavior, but it also provides an opportunity for rehabilitation.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: The person has been arrested once and convicted, which indicates some level of involvement with the justice system but not necessarily a pattern of recidivism. One arrest and conviction is relatively low compared to multiple offenses or convictions.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics**: Height and weight are noted, but these do not significantly impact risk assessment unless related to violent behavior or gang affiliation, which is not indicated here.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Being unmarried and living alone may suggest a lack of strong social support networks, which can be a risk factor. However, it does not directly indicate high risk without additional negative factors.\n\n5. **Education and Employment**: Enrollment in school is a positive indicator, suggesting engagement with constructive activities. Holding one job over the year indicates some level of stability, though it may also suggest limited work experience or instability.\n\n6. **Substance Use**: Past use of marijuana and cocaine within four years is concerning, as substance abuse can correlate with criminal behavior. However, there is no indication of current use, which reduces immediate risk.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: The absence of depression over the past month suggests stable mental health in that regard, reducing concern about self-harm or other related risks.\n\n8. **Family and Religious Beliefs**: Living with a single parent at a young age can be challenging but is not inherently risky unless associated with neglect or abuse, which is not indicated here. The belief that God does not influence personal events suggests a secular worldview, which may affect moral reasoning but does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\n**Conclusion**: While there are some risk factors present, such as past drug use and limited social support, the overall profile does not strongly indicate high risk of future criminal activity or recidivism. The positive engagement in education and lack of recent substance use or mental health issues suggest a lower level of immediate risk. Confidence is moderate due to the presence of both mitigating and concerning factors.",
