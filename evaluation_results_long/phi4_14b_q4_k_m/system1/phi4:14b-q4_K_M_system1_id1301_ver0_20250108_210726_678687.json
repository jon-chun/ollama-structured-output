    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n``` \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Age and Demographics:** At 18 years old, the individual is relatively young, which statistically correlates with a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. Being female and identifying as Black may influence her experience with systemic issues like bias, but these factors alone do not predict risk without context.\n\n- **Criminal History:** She has been arrested twice and convicted once, indicating some history of legal trouble, which can be an indicator of potential future risk.\n\n- **Education and Employment:** Lack of a high school diploma or GED and limited employment history (only two jobs in the past year) suggest instability in life circumstances. Educational attainment is often correlated with lower recidivism rates, so this is a concern.\n\n- **Substance Use:** Past drug use, even if it was marijuana, can be associated with higher risk behaviors, although there's no indication of current use or abuse.\n\n- **Mental Health and Support Systems:** She hasn\u2019t felt depressed in the past month and believes in divine influence over her life, which could provide some psychological resilience. However, mental health alone is not a definitive predictor without more context on support systems.\n\n- **Living Situation:** Living alone can be either positive (independence) or negative (lack of social support), but it does indicate potential for isolation.\n\nGiven these factors, there are several indicators pointing towards higher risk, though they do not guarantee future behavior. The confidence level reflects this uncertainty and the need for more comprehensive data to make a definitive prediction.",
