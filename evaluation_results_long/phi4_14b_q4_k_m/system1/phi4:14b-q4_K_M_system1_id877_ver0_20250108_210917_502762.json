A single arrest without conviction suggests low recidivism risk unless further context indicates otherwise.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics and Living Situation:** His height, weight, marital status (never married), and living alone are neutral factors without direct correlation to high-risk behavior in this context.\n\n4. **Education and Employment:** Enrollment in a 4-year college is generally associated with lower recidivism risk due to future opportunities. Having held one job during the year indicates some stability or effort towards employment, though not extensive.\n\n5. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression suggest low risk from these perspectives, as substance abuse and mental health issues can contribute to higher risk behavior.\n\n6. **Family Background and Beliefs:** Growing up with both biological parents and a household size of 4 is typically considered stable. His belief that God has nothing to do with his life might indicate a lack of certain religious or moral frameworks but is not inherently high-risk without additional context.\n\nOverall, the factors present suggest a low risk profile for recidivism or engagement in criminal behavior based on the available data. The confidence level is set at 75 due to some uncertainty inherent in human behavior prediction and the limited scope of information provided.",
