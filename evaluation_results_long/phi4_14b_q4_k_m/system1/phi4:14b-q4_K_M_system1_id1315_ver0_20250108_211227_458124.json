This suggests moderate risk rather than high risk.\n\n- **Stability Factors:**\n  - **Employment:** Holding a job for at least part of the year shows some degree of stability.\n  - **Substance Use:** No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor.\n  - **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed recently suggests current mental health stability.\n\n- **Social and Personal Factors:**\n  - **Marital Status:** Being unmarried and living alone might imply less social support, but it is not uncommon for his age group.\n  - **Education:** Having a GED certificate indicates some level of education attainment.\n  - **Religious Belief:** A belief that God influences personal life can be a stabilizing factor.\n\n- **Overall Assessment:** The combination of moderate criminal history with several positive stability factors suggests a lower risk compared to profiles with extensive criminal records or significant instability in employment, substance use, or mental health. Thus, the prediction is \"NO\" for high risk, with moderate confidence at 75%.",
