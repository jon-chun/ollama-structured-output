Additionally, having completed only one job during the year might indicate instability in employment, another risk factor for potential future offending.\n\nHowever, mitigating factors also exist, such as completing a Bachelor's degree, currently being enrolled in college (suggesting positive engagement in education), and not experiencing recent depression. These aspects could contribute to lower recidivism risks, which is why the confidence level is set at 65% rather than higher. The overall risk assessment indicates some concerns but also significant potential for rehabilitation and stability.",
