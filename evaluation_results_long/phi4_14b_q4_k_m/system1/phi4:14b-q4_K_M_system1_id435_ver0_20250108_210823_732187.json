This results in a moderate to high level of confidence in predicting a higher risk of re-offending. \n\nThe prediction \"YES\" is based on the aggregation of these risk factors, with particular emphasis on criminal history and socioeconomic disadvantages. The confidence score reflects the complexity and interplay of various factors.",
