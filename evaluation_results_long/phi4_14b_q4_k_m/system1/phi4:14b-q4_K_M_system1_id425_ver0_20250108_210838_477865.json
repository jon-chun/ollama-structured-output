However, age alone is not sufficient for high-risk determination.\n  \n- **Criminal History:** One arrest without conviction suggests potential involvement in criminal activities but does not confirm recidivism or high risk.\n\n- **Education and Employment:** Lack of a high school diploma/GED and holding multiple jobs within a year could indicate instability or challenges, which can be risk factors. However, employment shows some level of engagement with society.\n\n- **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana) is noted but not specified as current; this may suggest potential for future issues if coupled with other risk factors.\n\n- **Mental Health and Beliefs:** No recent depression and a belief system that does not include reliance on God may impact social support systems or moral guidance, which could be considered in risk assessment.\n\nGiven the combination of these factors, there is some indication of risk, but it's moderate. The confidence level reflects this uncertainty due to lack of more definitive markers (e.g., multiple convictions, current drug use, violent behavior).",
