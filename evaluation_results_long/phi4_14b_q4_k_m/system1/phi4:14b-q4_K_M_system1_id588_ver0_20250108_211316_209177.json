This could indicate potential but unproven involvement in criminal activity.\n\n3. **Substance Use**: Past use of marijuana and cocaine is noted, with recent feelings of depression, which might increase the risk due to possible substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\n4. **Employment History**: Holding 5 jobs within a year suggests instability in employment, which can be a stressor contributing to higher risk.\n\n5. **Mental Health Indicators**: The individual has experienced significant depressive symptoms recently, which is a critical factor in assessing risk for potential adverse behaviors or outcomes.\n\n6. **Social and Environmental Factors**: Living alone, being unmarried, and residing in an urban area might contribute to isolation or exposure to high-risk environments.\n\n7. **Educational Background**: While enrolled in college and having completed high school are positive factors, the combination with other risk factors may not sufficiently mitigate the overall risk.\n\n**Confidence Level**: The prediction of \"YES\" for high risk is made with moderate confidence (75) due to the presence of multiple significant risk factors despite some mitigating circumstances such as educational enrollment.",
