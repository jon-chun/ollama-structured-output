Even one conviction can indicate a propensity towards criminal activity.\n\n3. **Education and Employment**: Lack of high school diploma or GED and having held only one job during the year suggest instability, which can be associated with higher risk behavior.\n\n4. **Living Situation**: Living alone without significant social support structures may contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: Past drug use (marijuana) indicates a potential for substance-related issues, though it's not specified if this is ongoing.\n\n6. **Family and Social Environment**: Growing up in a large household with limited resources could have exposed him to stressors that increase risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\n7. **Religious Belief**: While he considers God has something to do with his life, this factor alone does not provide enough mitigating evidence against the other risk indicators present.\n\nThe combination of these factors contributes to a moderate-to-high level of concern regarding future risky behavior. However, without further detailed behavioral assessments and ongoing monitoring, absolute certainty is unattainable, hence the confidence rating of 75.",
