The individual is young and has only one arrest and conviction record, which suggests limited interaction with the criminal justice system. Her ongoing education in a two-year college program may provide positive engagement that can reduce future risks. While she has used marijuana in the past four years, there is no mention of substance abuse problems or legal issues related to drug use. Additionally, not experiencing depression recently is a good sign regarding her mental health.\n\nHowever, some risk factors could raise concern: the individual's weight and rural upbringing might suggest potential lifestyle challenges, but these are not strong indicators of criminal behavior without additional context. The fact that she has held multiple jobs in one year may indicate instability or resourcefulness, depending on other contextual factors not provided here.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk elements present, they do not strongly suggest high recidivism risk given the current information, leading to a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence of 75.",
