However, the absence of job history over one year is not necessarily indicative of chronic unemployment or instability.\n\n6. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in four years and no recent depression are strong indicators of stability.\n\n7. **Family Background:** Living with a single mother at a young age in a rural area does not inherently indicate high risk, especially without additional negative factors.\n\n8. **Religious Belief:** Considering God's role in personal events can be seen as a stabilizing belief system.\n\nOverall, the combination of limited criminal history, stable mental health, absence of substance use, and positive educational attainment suggest that this individual is at lower risk for future problematic behavior. However, the lack of employment could warrant some concern, hence not assigning full confidence.",
