This factor is thus given medium weight.\n\n- **Arrests and Convictions**: The presence of convictions significantly increases risk, as seen frequently across high-risk cases.\n\n- **Household Size at Young Age**: A household size of 5 doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism in these examples.\n\n- **Employment Stability**: Holding multiple jobs suggests some stability; however, it isn't a definitive protective factor. \n\n- **Drug Use**: The use of both marijuana and cocaine is particularly concerning and aligns with higher-risk cases.\n\n- **Depression**: The absence of recent depression might slightly reduce the risk according to observed patterns.\n\n- **Religious Belief**: A lack of belief in divine influence on personal events seems moderately linked to higher recidivism based on examples. \n\nOverall, the combination of convictions, drug use, and religious outlook suggests a prediction of \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with medium to high confidence due to the significant weight of these factors.",
