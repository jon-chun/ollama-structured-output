Indifference towards religion also correlates with higher recidivism in the examples provided.\n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" due to high weights on education, depression, and religious beliefs, balanced by mitigating factors like marital status and absence of drug use. Confidence is set at 70, reflecting uncertainty in mixed indicators but leaning toward a higher risk profile based on historical patterns.",
