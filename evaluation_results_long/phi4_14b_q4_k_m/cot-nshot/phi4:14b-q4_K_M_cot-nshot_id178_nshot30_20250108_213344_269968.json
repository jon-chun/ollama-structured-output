This high number suggests a higher risk of future arrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lacking a high school diploma or GED certificate can limit job opportunities and socio-economic mobility, factors known to influence recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding 2 jobs in the past year indicates some level of employment but may also suggest instability. Employment is often linked inversely with recidivism; however, it's unclear if these were stable positions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of both marijuana and cocaine within the last four years is indicative of substance abuse issues, a significant risk factor for recidivism due to its link with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health/Depression\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down most of the time during the past month points towards potential mental health concerns.

However, its impact on reducing recidivism is not clearly evidenced in these examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **Age**: While important, age alone isn't a strong predictor but combined with other factors can increase risk.\n  \n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Historically and contextually significant in this dataset; repeated presence in cases predicting \"YES\" suggests systemic issues affecting recidivism rates.\n\n- **Number of Arrests/Convictions**: The high number here is a clear indicator of persistent criminal behavior, strongly correlating with future arrests.\n\n- **Education Level**: Medium impact due to its role in socio-economic status and potential barriers to rehabilitation.\n\n- **Employment History**: While some employment indicates effort towards stability, the nature and quality of these jobs are uncertain. \n\n- **Drug Use**: High risk factor as substance abuse is closely linked to criminal activities and recidivism.\n\n- **Mental Health/Depression**: Medium impact due to its indirect influence on behavior through emotional instability or poor decision-making.\n\n- **Living Situation**: Low impact; though support systems are beneficial, the lack of them isn't a decisive factor alone.\n\n- **Household Size in Youth**: Moderate risk as large household sizes can reflect socio-economic challenges impacting early life development.\n\n- **Religious Belief**: The influence of religious belief on recidivism is minimal based on this dataset, thus given low weight. \n\nThe combination of high-risk factors (especially number of arrests/convictions and drug use), alongside moderate to medium risks related to mental health, employment history, education level, and socio-economic background, leads to a prediction of \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with high confidence.",
