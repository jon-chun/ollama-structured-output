The drug use, lack of education, and somewhat unstable youth home environment also significantly increase the likelihood of repeat offending over the next 3 years.\n\nHowever, her stable living situation (living alone), mental health stability (not depressed), and belief that God impacts her life provide some countering influences reducing the overall recidivism risk. \n\nBalancing all these factors together leads to a moderate confidence prediction that she will be rearrested within 3 years of this case, but the lower weights assigned to her youth home environment and religiosity slightly increase the chance she could defy expectations.\n\nSo in short - YES she likely will be rearrested within 3 years based on the available data points, but it is not an extremely strong or certain prediction.",
