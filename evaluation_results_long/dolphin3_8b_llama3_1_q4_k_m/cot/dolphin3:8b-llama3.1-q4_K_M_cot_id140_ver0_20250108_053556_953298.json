He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 154 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
