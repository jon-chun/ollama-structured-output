He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4.
