The individual's reported mental health struggles are significant and warrant closer attention to potential risk. \n\n\nLet me emphasize that this is a simplified example. A comprehensive risk assessment requires in-depth analysis, considering various legal history, social context, psychological evaluation, and other factors relevant to the situation.  \n",
