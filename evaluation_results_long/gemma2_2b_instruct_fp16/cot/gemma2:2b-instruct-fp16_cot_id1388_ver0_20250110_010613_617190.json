The combination of age, lack of education, and substance abuse further contribute to a high recidivism risk. \n* **Medium Risk Factors:** Her living situation and gender are considered medium risk factors as they don't strongly indicate recidivism risk in isolation. However, they need more context within the broader picture.  \n* **Low Risk Factors:** Religious beliefs are not considered a significant risk factor for recidivism.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Context is Crucial:** This assessment relies heavily on generalized statistical trends and individual details. A thorough, individualized risk assessment would take into account all relevant factors like current mental health status, social support network, criminal history specifics (type of crimes), and employment prospects.\n* **No Guarantees:**  This assessment provides a general prediction but does not guarantee future behavior. \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide definitive legal or professional advice.

She has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
