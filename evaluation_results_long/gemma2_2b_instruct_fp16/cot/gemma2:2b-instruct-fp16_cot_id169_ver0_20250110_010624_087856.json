This is a significant risk factor.\n* **Age (Medium):** Being 21 years old falls within a range where recidivism rates are generally higher, but not extreme.\n* **Socioeconomic Status (Low):** Limited education and employment history suggest instability and lack of resources, potentially increasing the likelihood of future crime.  \n* **Substance Use (Medium):** Past marijuana use, while less concerning than other drugs, can be a risk factor for relapse and potential reoffending. \n* **Religious Affiliation (Low):** While not a direct predictor, belief systems could provide some structure and support. \n* **Personal Support Network (Low):**  Living alone suggests limited social connections which may increase the likelihood of acting impulsively and engaging in risky behavior, thus increasing re-arrest risk.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This assessment is highly simplified and does not consider all possible factors that contribute to recidivism. \n* The \"confidence\" is a subjective estimate based on the available information and should be considered with caution. \n* A comprehensive risk assessment requires more in-depth data, including mental health history, psychological evaluations, substance abuse assessments, and other relevant circumstances.  \n",
