A GED and multiple jobs indicate she has some work experience. \n* **Substance Use:**  The lack of drug use in recent years is a positive factor.  \n* **Mental Health:** The mention of feeling \"down\" suggests potential mental health challenges, but it's crucial to understand the severity and ongoing support. It's categorized as \"high risk\" due to its potential for impact on behavior (but requires additional assessment).\n* **Religion/Spirituality:** This is considered a low-risk factor because it doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior. \n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*  **Context Matters:** A detailed evaluation of the individual's history, mental health issues, and support network is critical to assigning accurate weights and making predictions.\n* **Statistical Models:** This analysis is a simplified approach using basic risk factors. Complex statistical models incorporating these factors with additional variables (offense type, social ties, etc.) would likely provide more refined predictions. \n\n\nLet me emphasize that this assessment is for illustrative purposes only and should not be used to make real-world decisions about individuals or their legal cases. \n",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
