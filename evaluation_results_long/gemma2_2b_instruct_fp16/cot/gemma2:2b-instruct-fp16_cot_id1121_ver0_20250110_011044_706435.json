This factor is assigned medium weight because it does not significantly influence the likelihood of recidivism in this individual's case. \n* **Prior Arrest:**  A single arrest without conviction might suggest a low risk. However, this should be considered along with other factors.\n* **Education:** Lack of education can lead to limited opportunities and contribute to increased risk, especially if paired with unemployment and lack of social support. This factor is assigned high weight. \n* **Employment History:**  The absence of recent employment points towards a lack of structure, purpose, and potentially financial instability. This leads to a high risk score for recidivism.\n* **Housing Status:** Living alone may indicate some level of independence and stability, while the lack of social support is an indicator that needs to be addressed. This factor is assigned low weight. \n* **Substance Use History:** The absence of drug use over the past four years suggests a positive influence on his health and life choices. \n* **Mental Health:**  The absence of depression in the past month indicates a positive aspect of his current well-being which reduces risk.\n\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* This assessment is based on limited information. A more comprehensive analysis would include factors like criminal history, family support, social networks, and specific offense details. \n* Recidivism prediction models are not perfect. Other individual factors, as well as the context of the justice system within a particular community or country, can significantly impact recidivism rates. \n\n\n\n",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
