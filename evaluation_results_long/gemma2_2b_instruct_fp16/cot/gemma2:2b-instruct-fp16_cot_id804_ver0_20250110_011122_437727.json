Here's my reasoning: \n\n* **High Risk Factors:** A history of multiple arrests and convictions indicates a high risk. This is a clear indicator of potential future involvement with the criminal justice system.\n* **Medium Risk Factors:**  Age, marital status, employment history, and substance use all contribute to the calculation. These factors can influence future behavior but are not as strong indicators on their own. \n\n**Important Notes:**\nThis analysis is based on limited information. A more comprehensive assessment would include:\n* **Detailed Criminal History:** The nature of offenses, level of violence, etc.\n* **Substance Use Patterns:** Ongoing use or past struggles with addiction need consideration.\n* **Mental Health Diagnosis and Treatment:** Whether diagnosed and how actively managed are essential factors.\n* **Support Systems in place:** Are there family members, friends, or social programs available for support? \n\n**Remember:** This is just a starting point; a professional risk assessment requires more information and expert analysis to make informed decisions about an individual's potential for recidivism. \n",
