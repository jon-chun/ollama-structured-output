This is often associated with impulsivity and difficulty making long-term plans. \n* **Race:** While race can be a contributing factor in criminal justice systems, it doesn't necessarily predict future behavior.  \"Medium\" weight as this specific demographic may experience higher arrest rates in some contexts. \n* **Criminal History:** The single prior conviction is a low risk factor compared to those with multiple offenses or serious crimes.\n* **Previous Employment:** Lack of employment over the year, while not an isolated issue, doesn't inherently signal increased recidivism. \n* **Education:** GED and lack of college enrollment are considered indicators of lower socioeconomic status which can be linked to higher recidivism rates. However, this is a medium weight factor as individuals without higher education can still be productive members of society. \n* **Drug Use:** Past marijuana use is a low risk factor because it's a relatively common substance with generally non-violent consequences and no indication of severe addiction or drug-related behavior.\n* **Living Situation:** Living alone is associated with increased risk in some cases, but it can also indicate independence and responsibility. \n* **Religious Affiliation:** This factor is considered low as it does not inherently predict criminal behavior.\n\n**Prediction & Confidence:** \n\nBased on the combined weight of these factors, a prediction of \"NO\" for rearrest recidivism within three years seems appropriate. This prediction has an 80% confidence level because a significant number of individual risk factors are present that could be addressed through rehabilitation and support services to mitigate future criminal behavior.  \n",
