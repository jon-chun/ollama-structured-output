Here's why:\n\n* **Age:** While young age can be mitigating, the individual's age (21) within the context of previous criminal history and other factors makes him more susceptible to future offenses.\n* **Criminal History:** One prior conviction signifies an established pattern of behavior that could escalate. \n* **Education & Employment:** Lack of education and a limited job history suggest challenges in obtaining stable employment, potentially leading to financial instability, social isolation, or desperation driving criminal activities. \n* **Substance Use:** The individual's past drug use is a significant risk factor that can lead to impulsive behavior, poor decision-making, and increase the likelihood of repeat offenses.\n* **Personal Circumstances:**  Living alone and lack of strong family support contribute to social isolation, which increases vulnerability to criminal activity and weakens societal ties that usually deter crime.\n\n\n**Important Notes:** This is a preliminary risk assessment based on limited information and should not be interpreted as definitive or a substitute for professional evaluation. \n",
