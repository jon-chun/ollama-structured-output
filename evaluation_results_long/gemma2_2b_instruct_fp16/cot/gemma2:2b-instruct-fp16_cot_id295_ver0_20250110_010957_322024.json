While some factors like age, history of offenses, substance use all have a strong influence, others carry less weight due to the limited information provided about his social environment or potential support systems. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This is just one possible interpretation, and a more comprehensive risk assessment would require additional information and tools.\n* The \"confidence\" score reflects an educated guess based on the available data and my experience as a criminal justice expert. It should not be taken as absolute certainty about future behavior.  \n* This analysis highlights that even with high-risk factors, individual circumstances matter and deserve nuanced consideration in any risk assessment. \n\n\n",
