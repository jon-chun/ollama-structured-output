The factors considered, and their weightings, are based on established recidivism risk research, criminal justice practices, and individual characteristics. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* **Individualization:** This response is a general example and cannot be used for definitive decision-making in real-life applications. Individual cases require nuanced assessment by qualified professionals.\n* **Data Limitations:** The provided information is limited and may not encompass all necessary details for a comprehensive risk assessment.  \n* **Bias Mitigation:**  It's crucial to acknowledge and mitigate potential biases when evaluating risk factors, which can arise from systemic inequalities within the justice system. \n\n\n\nLet me know if you would like to explore this analysis further! \n",
