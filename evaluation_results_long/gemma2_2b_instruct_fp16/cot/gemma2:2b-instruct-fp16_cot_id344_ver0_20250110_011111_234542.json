The confidence score reflects this assessment.  \n\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis provides a preliminary risk assessment based on limited information. A comprehensive evaluation would require more detailed data and a nuanced understanding of the individual's history and circumstances. \n",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 0 inches and weighs 180 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 9 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area.
