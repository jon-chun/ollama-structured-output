It's important to remember that this is a simplified model: \n\n* **Risk factors are weighted subjectively.** The weighting system used here leans toward specific areas of concern due to statistical data trends, but subjective judgment can still impact results. \n* **Context matters.**  The individual's criminal history, mental health situation, and support systems need more in-depth analysis for a more accurate prediction.\n\n\n**Please Note:** This is an example, and real risk assessments require far greater nuance and consideration of the individual's circumstances. This model should not be used as a definitive tool for decision-making. \n",

He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
