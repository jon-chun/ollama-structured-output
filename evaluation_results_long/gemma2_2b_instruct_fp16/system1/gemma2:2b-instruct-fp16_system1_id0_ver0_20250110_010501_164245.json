Especially at 18, he's in a period where impulsive actions are more common.\n* **Socioeconomic disadvantage:** Lack of education, job history, and living situation all point towards potential vulnerabilities and limitations that might lead to involvement in criminal activity.\n* **Substance use (marijuana):**  While not always indicative of future violence, the past use suggests possible ongoing substance abuse, a factor linked to increased risk behaviors. \n* **Urban background:** Living in an urban area often correlates with higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences that can impact decision-making.\n\n**Note:** While confidence is high, it's crucial to remember:\n\n* This assessment relies solely on the provided information. Additional factors like specific crimes committed, potential motives, and social support systems could significantly alter risk perception.\n* This is a preliminary analysis. A comprehensive risk assessment would require in-depth interviews, background checks, psychological evaluations, etc., for a more accurate prediction. \n",
