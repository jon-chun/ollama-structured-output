Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
