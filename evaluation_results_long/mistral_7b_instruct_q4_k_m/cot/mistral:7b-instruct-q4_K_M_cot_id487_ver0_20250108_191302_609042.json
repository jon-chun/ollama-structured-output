Factors with a low weight (low):\n* Gender: Female\n* Age: 21\n* Lives alone: Not a factor in this case as there is no information about her living arrangements\n* Education: High school diploma and enrolled in college\n* Employment history: Held 2 jobs in the past year\n1. Factors with a medium weight (medium):\n* Race/ethnicity: White\n* Prior arrests but no conviction\n* Height and weight: Not relevant to risk of rearrest\n1. Factors with a high weight (high):\n* History of drug use: The person has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor for rearrest.\n* Recent feelings of depression: While not directly related to rearrest, recent mental health issues can contribute to increased risk of criminal activity.\n1. Other factors that may be relevant but are not explicitly mentioned in the information provided (low):\n* Lived with biological parents at a young age: Not a significant factor as there is no indication that this person had a difficult upbringing or was exposed to negative influences at an early age.\n* Does not believe in God: This factor may be relevant in some cases, but it does not appear to have any direct impact on the risk of rearrest in this situation.\n\nBased on my analysis, I predict that there is a low risk (70%) of rearrest for this individual in the next three years. However, it's important to note that these predictions are based on statistical models and should not be used as the sole basis for determining an individual's risk of reoffending.",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 160 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
