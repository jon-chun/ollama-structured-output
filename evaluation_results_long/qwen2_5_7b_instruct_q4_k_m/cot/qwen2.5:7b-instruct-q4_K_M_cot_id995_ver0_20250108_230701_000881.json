He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 3. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
