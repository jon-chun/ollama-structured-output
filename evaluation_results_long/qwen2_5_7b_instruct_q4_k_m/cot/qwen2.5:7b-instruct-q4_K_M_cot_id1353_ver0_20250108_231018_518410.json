He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area.
