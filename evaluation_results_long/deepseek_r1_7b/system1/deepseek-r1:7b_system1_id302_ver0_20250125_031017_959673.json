    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White and identified as such. I'm not sure how race factors into risk assessments here. Maybe it's more about her personal circumstances or environment? Not immediately obvious, so maybe this doesn't add much weight.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions are typically associated with higher recidivism rates. So that's a point towards high risk.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 3 inches and she weighs 135 lbs. Body type could influence how she interacts socially or handle stress, but without more info on her health or other habits, this might not be a strong indicator.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can affect emotional well-being; being single might mean less support network which could increase stress or isolation, contributing to higher risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is important because lower education often correlates with poorer job opportunities and higher risk of involvement in the criminal system again.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs during the year. Job stability can affect someone's ability to manage substance use or financial stressors. Having some recent job experience might indicate she's more stable, but three jobs still shows she has some employment history.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for various issues like mental health problems, which can affect her ability to function socially or at work. The recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying issues.\n\nShe's had a tough upbringing living with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That's a red flag because systemic factors from childhood, especially in crowded households, often lead to higher levels of stress and emotional instability, which can increase risk behaviors or mental health issues.\n\nBelieving in God plays a role in her personal belief system, but without knowing if that supports her coping mechanisms or contributes positively, it's hard to gauge. Some religious beliefs might offer support networks, while others might not. It's more about her personal resilience and surrounding environments.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest and living circumstances are strong indicators of high risk. Her recent drug use, current instability (though she has jobs), and tough upbringing contribute significantly. The lack of a stable environment combined with substance abuse points towards high risk. I think the confidence here is pretty high, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
