    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male Hispanic. Age and ethnicity aren't direct indicators of risk unless there's a known bias or societal impact on that group, which isn't specified here. So maybe low confidence from these factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Prior convictions can be significant; even one arrest might indicate some underlying issues. So that's a point towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 5'4\" and weight between 175-199 lbs, which falls into the underweight or slightly overweight category for his age. Underweight individuals sometimes have different health risks, but it depends on other factors like activity level. Not sure how much this contributes yet.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, so no spouse to provide support. Living alone can increase isolation and stress, which might raise risk factors like depression or substance use.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a key factor; lack of education can lead to more delinquent behavior or lack of opportunities that contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe has held one job during the year, so maybe some income stability but also might imply he's looking for better opportunities, which could be a positive sign unless there are issues with that job (like substance use).\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can have mental health impacts and is linked to various risk behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Lack of recent depression might suggest he's managing his mental health better, but it's also possible he just doesn't report it often or isn't seeking help.\n\nAt a young age (19) lived with his biological mother in a household of eight. That's a very large family; could indicate living conditions that were harsh, which might contribute to behavioral issues or substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. This is a personal belief and doesn't directly correlate with risk unless it influences his behavior towards substances or seeking help.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest (conviction) is a strong indicator of past issues, which can increase future risk. Age 19 might be a high school graduate; but he's not enrolled in college. Drug use and living with many family members could indicate stressors contributing to substance abuse and potential behavioral issues.\n\nHe hasn't been depressed recently, so maybe he's managing well or doesn't report it. However, past factors like drug use and family environment can be significant. The lack of a high school diploma might mean limited opportunities leading to more risky behaviors.\n\nSo while some factors are mitigating (like not being married, living alone but no recent depression), the presence of prior arrest, substance use, and family circumstances all point towards a higher risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
