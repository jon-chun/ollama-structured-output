    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's a 20-year-old male from White background. He's been arrested once but not convicted. He's 5'9\" and weighs 160 lbs. Unmarried and living alone, with a high school diploma but enrolled in college. He's worked two jobs in the past year. He used cocaine in the last four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. He believes God has some role in his life.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each factor one by one. The fact that he's been arrested once doesn't necessarily indicate high risk since it's not a conviction; however, recidivism is often a concern. His living situation alone might suggest some instability, but it could also be due to personal choice or necessity. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive.\n\nHis use of cocaine is concerning because drug use can affect mental health and stability. The recent lack of depression might not fully explain that; perhaps he's just managing without it now. His high school diploma and being enrolled in college show some level of education but don't directly correlate with risk unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or unstable circumstances.\n\nHis past living situation is a bit concerning because living with his biological mother in an urban area at a young age could have implications, maybe indicating family issues or potential neglect. However, urban environments can offer more opportunities and less family dependency compared to rural areas. His religious belief might be a protective factor but isn't directly tied to risk.\n\nConsidering all these together: one arrest, no prior conviction, some living challenges, drug use history, and recent mental health status. The lack of immediate indicators like multiple offenses or significant family issues makes me lean towards low risk, but there are factors that could indicate potential for future issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
