    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk and then provide a JSON response with \"prediction\" as YES or NO and \"confidence\" as a number between 0 and 100. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age might be a consideration since younger individuals could have different risk profiles compared to older ones. But without more context on his behavior or history, it's hard to say much here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. So this suggests some legal issues, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk of reoffending if the prior offense was violent or serious. However, since he hasn't been convicted, maybe the risk is lower because there's no official criminal record yet.\n\nHe is 6 feet 11 inches and weighs 220 lbs. That indicates a high body mass, possibly leading to health issues which can contribute to criminal behavior indirectly but might not be directly linked to recidivism.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married and currently living alone. Living alone at such a young age could mean he's still developing socially or maybe experiencing instability. This might put him in a vulnerable situation where he's more susceptible to making poor decisions.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; sometimes, not having higher education can lead to involvement in the criminal system if there are gaps in his skills or opportunities. However, it also depends on other factors like support systems.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t held any jobs during the year. Employment is generally linked with lower recidivism rates because stable income can provide motivation and reduce stress. Not working might indicate underlying issues that could be contributing to this situation.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, especially marijuana, can affect judgment and behavior. It's a minor drug compared to others like cocaine or heroin, but it still has cognitive effects which might influence decisions.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t felt depressed over the past month. Depression is linked with higher risk of substance abuse and criminal behavior. If he\u2019s not feeling depressed now, that might indicate better mental health, which could be a protective factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. High household size can lead to stress, neglect, or other issues due to crowded living conditions. Urban environments sometimes have different dynamics compared to rural areas, possibly affecting behavior.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal events. This suggests he has a religious belief system which might provide him with some guidance and reduce impulsive or harmful behaviors influenced by external factors like religion not addressing his deeper issues.\n\nPutting this all together: He's got a history of legal issues, living in a challenging environment, no education beyond high school, unemployment status, and some substance use. The lack of criminal conviction is mitigating that risk to some extent. However, the high body mass and living situation could be contributing factors. Without more info on his mental health or support systems, it's hard to pin down the exact risk level.\n\nI'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with maybe 40% confidence because while there are some negative indicators, he hasn't been convicted yet, and other factors like family living situation might be contributing but not heavily.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
