    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their impact.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male Hispanic, arrested once without a conviction. Single and living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk, but it depends on other factors. His education level is a high school diploma and attending college now, which might indicate some stability.\n\nHe has five jobs, which usually suggests he's active in the workforce and possibly stable financially. Drug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially recently when he felt down. That could be concerning because drug abuse often correlates with unstable behavior or increased risk of other issues like delinquency.\n\nHis mental health history is mentioned\u2014he feels down and was unable to find comfort during a recent bad episode. This could point towards underlying mental health issues or emotional instability, which are significant risk factors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of two in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such conditions can have long-term effects on behavior and mental health. Being raised by his mother might also influence his relationships and future stability.\n\nHis religious belief that God plays a role is positive, which could indicate personal motivation or strong moral values. However, religious factors alone don't directly contribute to risk unless there's evidence of neglect or lack of support from the faith community.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest without a conviction might not be severe, but the drug use and recent emotional distress are red flags. His young age also means he may still be developing coping mechanisms. The living situation could have contributed to his mental health issues. While some factors point towards low risk, others suggest higher risk. However, considering the drug use and possible instability, I would lean toward a high risk but with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
