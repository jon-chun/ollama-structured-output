    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's been arrested twice and convicted as a White male living alone at 22 years old. Let me break down each factor.\n\nFirst, he's got two prior arrests and a conviction. That's already a red flag because recidivism is a big concern in risk assessment. People with a history ofConvicting for more than one time are usually higher risks.\n\nHe's White, which might be an indicator based on some demographic data, but I can't jump to conclusions without more info. So maybe 20% related to his race as a factor.\n\nAge-wise, he's in his early 20s, which is typically when people start making decisions that could impact their future criminal behavior. But age alone isn't enough; it's the number of prior offenses that matter more here.\n\nHe lives alone and hasn't been married yet. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or lack of support, but it also might indicate he has good personal resources. His marital status is less concerning unless there's evidence of domestic issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHis education level: high school diploma and attending college. Education usually correlates with lower risk because higher education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. So maybe that's a negative factor reducing his risk by 30%.\n\nHe's only held one job in the past year. Unemployment for that long can sometimes be linked to substance abuse or other issues, but it also could indicate he's actively seeking new opportunities. Not sure how much weight to give this.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is strongly associated with higher risk of reoffending. It increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again. That seems like a significant factor, maybe contributing 40% towards high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health can influence behavior, lack of depression might suggest he's stable mentally. But it's not directly related to recidivism as much as substance use or other factors.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with both biological parents suggests he was raised in a complex family environment. Some households are more chaotic and might have different dynamics that could affect his behavior. Maybe 10% related to family environment.\n\nHe believes in God, which is a positive factor often linked to personal morality and good behavior. This might actually lower the risk by about 20%.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high risk), drug use (very high risk), living alone with no marriage but maybe not as much of an issue unless there's more on that front. Education is protective, age is neutral in this context.\n\nI think overall, considering his two prior arrests and recent drug use, he might have a high risk score. Maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
