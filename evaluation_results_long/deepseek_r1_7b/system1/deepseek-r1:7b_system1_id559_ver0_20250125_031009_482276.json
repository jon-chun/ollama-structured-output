    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 18 might be a minor, but it doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there's a history of delinquency or substance abuse issues. Being White could potentially indicate a higher socioeconomic background, which sometimes correlates with better access to resources, but that depends on other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested 3 times and convicted. Multiple arrests are a significant concern because each arrest can lead to more serious legal consequences, like longer prison sentences. If he's already served time, it might reflect past problematic behavior or substance abuse issues.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 215 lbs. These measurements don't raise immediate red flags unless they indicate underlying health issues like obesity, which could be a risk factor for other health problems that might affect his ability to commit further crimes.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to feelings of depression or loneliness, possibly leading to substance abuse as a coping mechanism. He's not enrolled in college but has a high school diploma, so he may have moved on from formal education, possibly indicating disengagement with his past life.\n\nHe has held 2 jobs during the year. Having two job opportunities suggests some level of responsibility and financial stability, which might indicate lower risk compared to someone who is unemployed or underemployed.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can have serious consequences, including addiction, which could lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors. The mention that he felt down for much of the past month adds to the potential for substance abuse issues affecting his mental health and thus his risk level.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of seven people. A large family can be isolating and might contribute to feelings of loneliness, especially if there's no support system. This could lead to emotional distress or substance use as a way to cope with stress or anxiety.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal fate. This religious belief might provide some level of structure or moral guidance but could also indicate potential issues like substance abuse or neglecting responsibilities due to fear of failure or self-blame.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the multiple arrests, substance use (marijuana and possibly others), living in a large household which may lack support, and potential emotional distress from recent feelings of low mood, it's likely that this individual is at high risk. I'll assign a confidence level of 85% because there are several concerning indicators but not an overwhelming number without more context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
