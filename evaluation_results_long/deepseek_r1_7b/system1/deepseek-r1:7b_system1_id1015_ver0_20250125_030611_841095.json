The user is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which is a significant factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs between 200-224 lbs, which might indicate obesity. Obesity is linked to various health issues that could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness, which sometimes people use as an excuse for substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is another key factor; not having a degree might mean he has less life skills and could be more susceptible to engaging in risky activities.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year, which suggests he can support himself somewhat, but it also shows he may have struggled with stability or perhaps is facing challenges that prevent him from working effectively.\n\nHe used marijuana within the past four years. Drug use, especially among adolescents, is a known risk factor for various issues including substance abuse disorders and criminal behavior related to drug use.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While not feeling depressed might seem positive, chronic depression can have serious consequences that he might be avoiding or not acknowledging.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2 in an urban area. Early experiences can shape one's behavior and values; living in a single-parent household might contribute to behavioral issues.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which could lead to a lack of spiritual support or guidance, possibly affecting decision-making and relationships.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, they collectively point towards high risk. Prior convictions, socioeconomic challenges, substance use, living alone, and other behavioral indicators all contribute to a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
