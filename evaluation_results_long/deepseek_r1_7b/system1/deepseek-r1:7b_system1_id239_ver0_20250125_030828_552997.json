    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the person based on the given data. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age might be a minor factor here since it's relatively young, but being a minority could have implications in certain contexts regarding treatment or support systems.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. That means there are no activeConvictions on his record, so that's one less risk factor related to prior criminal history.\n\nHis height is 7 feet 3 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. While this might indicate he's physically strong, the weight relative to his height could be concerning if it's unusually high for his age, but I don't have enough information on that. It doesn't immediately raise red flags unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's living alone, hasn't been married, and is currently single. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might increase the risk of substance abuse or other behavioral issues.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment often correlates with lower recidivism rates, so not having this qualification could be a red flag for potential future criminal behavior or lack of motivation to change his circumstances.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment history can indicate if someone is stable and capable of supporting themselves. Having only one job might suggest instability, which could relate to higher risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone doesn't necessarily correlate with high risk unless it's linked to other negative behaviors or outcomes. Since he hasn't felt depressed lately, this might indicate he's managing his substance use.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of five in an urban area. A large family could mean more supervision but if he's been through that at a young age, it might suggest he was raised in a stable environment initially. However, the fact that he considers God unrelated to his personal experiences could indicate a lack of spiritual support or a possible atheists' perspective, which some may find lonely.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: no prior convictions, living alone but without a strong support network, limited education and employment, and a brief marijuana use with no recent depression. The absence of activeConvictions might actually lower the risk here. However, his age being 19 is on the higher end; if he were to commit a crime again, it could have significant implications in terms of legal and social consequences.\n\nSo, I would say this person's risk is low because there are no active convictions, but considering the factors like living situation, education, employment, and past substance use. The lack of high school diploma and job history might be more concerning if he were to become involved again, but without prior convictions, it's a bit lower.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
