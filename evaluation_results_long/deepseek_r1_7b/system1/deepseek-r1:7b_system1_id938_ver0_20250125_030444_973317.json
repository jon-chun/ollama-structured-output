    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment step by step. The individual is a 22-year-old male Black who has been arrested five times and convicted before. That's a significant number of prior convictions; I know that's a strong indicator of recidivism.\n\nHis demographics: age 22 isn't too far from typical reoffenders, but his race could play into stereotypes, though we need to be cautious not to jump to conclusions without more data.\n\nHe has never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence his ability to resist recidivism, but it's a mixed factor here.\n\nEducation-wise, he lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Educational barriers often contribute to substance abuse and unstable environments, which could increase risk.\n\nOccupation: holding three jobs in a year is commendable; having steady income can reduce dependency on illegal activities.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While drug use can lead to other issues like self-harm or substance abuse, the lack of recent depression might suggest he's managing it better than others.\n\nFamily history: living with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area, along with considering God's influence on his life, indicates he may have some spiritual support and possibly a more stable family environment. However, urban environments can be high-risk areas due to higher crime rates or social issues.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior convictions are the strongest indicator of high risk. Other factors like education and drug use contribute but aren't as significant. The lack of a strong family relationship might counterbalance some of these negative traits, but given his history, he's likely at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
