    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 22 is relatively young, but being White can sometimes be associated with lower recidivism rates in some studies, so that might not be a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which is significant because prior convictions are often used as predictors of future criminal behavior. So this could indicate high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 165 lbs. While weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism studies, with the given information, it's not clear how relevant this is without more context about his past behavior or other risk factors.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors like isolation issues, but since he's never married, maybe that's a mitigating factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can correlate with lower recidivism rates because education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability. Not being enrolled might suggest some instability, but again, it depends on other factors.\n\nHe held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs is generally positive as it shows responsibility and ability to support oneself. This could be a mitigating factor against high risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years suggests he's stable in that area, which might lower the risk of substance abuse-related offenses or issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is important because someone who's mentally unwell might not make the best decisions. Not feeling depressed could be a positive sign.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Growing up in a multi-person household can sometimes lead to different stressors compared to smaller households, but it doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there were issues within the family or living conditions that caused problems.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can be protective as they might provide guidance and support against negative behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: One prior arrest is a red flag. Age 22, being White, education level, not being married, living alone, holding three jobs, no drug use, and positive mental health don't immediately suggest high risk but the prior arrest does. The other factors might mitigate some of that risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" with lower confidence because while there are mitigating points, the one prior arrest is a significant factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
