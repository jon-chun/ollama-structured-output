    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old White female who was arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can sometimes lead to further issues, especially if they're from when she was younger or if there are underlying issues that led to the arrest without conviction. But since it's only one, maybe it doesn't immediately indicate high risk.\n\nShe's 5 feet 1 inch and weighs between 125-149 lbs. That's a bit on the lighter side but not necessarily indicative of anything specific unless there are other factors related to weight that could suggest something else.\n\nShe hasn't been married, isn't living alone currently, and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Lack of education can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not always directly linked to criminal behavior. It might indicate she's seeking help but hasn't found it yet.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Single job experience isn't typically a strong indicator unless there are issues like unemployment or lack of stability that could lead to other problems.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (specifically marijuana) and not feeling depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes be linked to underlying mental health issues, but since she doesn't feel depressed now, it might suggest she's managed it well or maybe using it for coping mechanisms without major issues.\n\nShe lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area, in a household of five, and considers God unrelated to her personal life. Living with multiple family members can sometimes be protective if they provide support, but if the environment is chaotic or there's neglect, that could indicate higher risk. Her lack of religious involvement might suggest she doesn't have strong spiritual support, which could be linked to behavioral issues.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a single arrest without conviction, which might hint at an issue that hasn't been fully resolved but isn't necessarily high-risk on its own. Her living situation in an urban area with five people is somewhat concerning if there's neglect or instability, but without more info, it's hard to tell. Her lack of education and job experience are neutral factors.\n\nI think the main points here don't strongly indicate a high risk. The arrest could be an isolated incident, she might not have significant mental health issues as indicated by her recent lack of depression, and her living situation isn't directly alarming without more context. Therefore, I would lean towards low risk but with some reservations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
