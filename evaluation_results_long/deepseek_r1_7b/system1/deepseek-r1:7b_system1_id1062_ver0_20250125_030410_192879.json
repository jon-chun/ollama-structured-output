    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone based on the given data. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. His age is quite young, and being Black can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, but I don't know if that applies here since he hasn't been convicted yet.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's one arrest, which isn't a lot, but it shows some involvement in the legal system. Without a conviction, maybe his risk is lower than someone with multiple arrests or a prior offense.\n\nHis height and weight are within typical ranges for his age and gender; that doesn't seem to contribute much to risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk-taking behaviors, but again, it depends on other factors like substance use.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which might indicate some level of stability, though not necessarily low risk if he's using drugs or has other issues.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, especially with limited skills for finding another job, but having one job shows some employability.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone isn't necessarily a high-risk indicator if he's not experiencing severe mental health issues, but it could be a risk factor depending on other factors.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite drug use. That's interesting; maybe he's managing his use without severe withdrawal or emotional distress.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. This could indicate family instability, which might be associated with higher risk behavior due to lack of supervision or support.\n\nBelieving in God: This is more of a personal belief and doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's evidence that religious beliefs influence criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the key points are one arrest, drug use (but no recent depression), living with an extended family in an urban area. The lack of conviction and being 22 might temper some risk factors. However, his past residence history could be a red flag for instability or neglect. Without further information on employment, education beyond high school, and any other criminal history, it's hard to assign a very high confidence level.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the risk is present but not extremely high. Therefore, maybe around 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
