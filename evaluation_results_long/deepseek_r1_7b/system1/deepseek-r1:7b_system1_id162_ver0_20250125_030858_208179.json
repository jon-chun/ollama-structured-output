    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. The user wants me to act as a highly experienced criminal justice risk assessment expert. Let's break down each risk factor and assess its impact on risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his late teens might still be a vulnerable age with fewer life experiences that could indicate higher recidivism. His race is White, which isn't inherently predictive unless there's a systemic issue, but I don't have information on that.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction can sometimes lead to more caution from the court system, possibly leading to better support and less involvement in the future. However, it also depends on the nature of the previous offense.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, which isn't particularly unusual or concerning. Weight at 135 lbs; that's average for his height. No drugs used in the past four years\u2014this is a strong positive indicator as drug use can be linked to criminal behavior or substance abuse issues.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stability from a supportive home environment could reduce risk, especially since he lived with both biological parents at a young age in an urban area. That might have provided him with better social support and resources during tough times.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college; maybe still working to get more education or employed. Being employed can help with financial stability and reducing stressors that might lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held two jobs, which suggests good work history and possibly some ability to manage responsibilities. Not feeling depressed over the past month is another positive sign as mental health issues can contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors: no prior convictions, stable living situation with a spouse, positive mental state, lack of drug use, decent job history, and being in his early 20s who might still be developing. These seem like indicators that could lower the risk rather than increase it. So my initial thought is that this person does not indicate high risk.\n\nBut wait, I should consider if there's any hidden risk factors here. For example, even without a conviction, the nature of his previous arrest could be concerning if it was violent or led to significant trauma. However, since we don't have information on the type of offense, that aspect isn't addressed here.\n\nAlso, considering his age and being White\u2014though I don't have specific data on crime rates for White individuals versus others at this age\u2014it's generally recognized that Black individuals make up a larger proportion of the criminal justice system. But without specific statistical data tied to these factors, it's hard to assign a higher risk weight.\n\nSo putting all together: low confidence in high risk because of positive factors like no prior convictions, stable family, good job history, and positive mental state.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
