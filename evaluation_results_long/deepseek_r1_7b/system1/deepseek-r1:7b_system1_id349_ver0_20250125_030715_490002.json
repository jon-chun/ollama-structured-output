    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual in question. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they might contribute to his risk profile.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Race can sometimes be associated with certain risk behaviors or outcomes based on societal stereotypes, but it's not always directly related. Since he has been convicted once and arrested before, that's a significant factor. Recidivism rates are often higher among individuals with prior convictions, so this could indicate a history of reoffending.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches, which isn't unusual for a male, and his weight is 212 lbs. These physical attributes don't directly suggest any risk factors on their own but might be relevant in certain contexts like substance use or injury prevention.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors such as drug use or financial instability, though without more information, it's hard to say for sure. His lack of marital status doesn't immediately point towards high risk but might be a contributing factor if combined with other factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level can influence his job opportunities, relationships, and overall stability. While not directly risky, it's worth noting that having an education might also mean better access to resources or support systems which could mitigate risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency issues like substance abuse, lack of income support, and increased risk of criminal behavior. This is a red flag as unemployment often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse, particularly marijuana use, has been linked to various health complications and behavioral issues, which can increase the likelihood of further substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While not a direct risk factor, chronic depression can lead to substance abuse, which we already noted as an issue. However, his lack of recent depression might suggest some level of mental health stability.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Growing up in a multi-parent household in an urban setting could have both protective and negative aspects. Urban environments can offer more opportunities but may also be associated with higher stress or exposure to risk factors like substance abuse, lack of supervision, etc.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief might provide some level of support or guidance, potentially mitigating certain risks. However, it's possible he could turn to other beliefs or have unresolved issues affecting his behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior conviction (high risk), living alone without a job and no stable environment, substance use (marijuana) which is risky, and considering his young age when living in a large household might indicate exposure to certain risks. Additionally, he's 22, which is still relatively early in life, but his history of substance use and lack of employment could be significant.\n\nHis confidence level would reflect how sure these factors point towards high risk. Considering the prior conviction, unemployment, substance use, and other factors, it seems like a high likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
