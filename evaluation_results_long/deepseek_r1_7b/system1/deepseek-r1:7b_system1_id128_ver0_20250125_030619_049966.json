    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk for some issue, probably criminal behavior or reoffending. The person is a 20-year-old male of White descent. He's been arrested once and convicted, which alone might suggest some past criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a height of 5'11\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That's on the lower end for his height but within a normal weight range; not sure if that affects risk directly.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone, which might indicate he's in a stable or unstable living situation. Without a partner, maybe less support, but I'm not certain how that ties to risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is attending 2-year college, suggesting some level of education but also that he's actively seeking further learning, perhaps indicating responsibility.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, so he has some work experience. Job stability can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, but I'm not sure if having a job lowers risk enough to be considered high.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is often linked to higher risk of criminal behavior because drugs can impair judgment and lead to impulsive actions. However, not feeling depressed now doesn't necessarily negate past drug use or its impact on decisions.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at age 5-10 in a household of four in an urban area. That's concerning because living in such environments is often associated with higher risk of criminal behavior due to exposure to negative influences like substance abuse, neglect, or conflict.\n\nConsidering God's involvement in his life shows he has some spiritual connection, which might be protective against certain types of delinquency, but it doesn't directly indicate high risk on its own.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a criminal history (conviction), drug use, living with an alcoholic parent in an urban area, and no recent depression. These factors increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
