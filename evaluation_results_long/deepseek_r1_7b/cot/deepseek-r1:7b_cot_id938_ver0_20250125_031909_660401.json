    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to assess this risk. So, the person is a Black male, 22 years old, with 5 prior arrests and convictions. He's 5'8\" and 165 lbs, single living alone without a high school diploma or GED. He's employed 3 jobs in the past year, used marijuana in the last four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. His early life was in a household of four with his biological mother in an urban area, and he believes in God affecting his personal life.\n\nFirst, I'll start by looking at each risk factor one by one. The age is 22, which is relatively young, so maybe that's not the biggest concern unless there's something indicating he's a chronic offender. But he has five prior arrests, which is significant. convictions: high number\u2014five times. That alone might point towards a high risk.\n\nHis lack of education\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014is a red flag. Without proper education, job opportunities might be limited, leading to unstable situations that could contribute to recidivism. Also, he's not enrolled in college and has only held three jobs recently\u2014this could indicate inconsistent work history, which can affect his ability to manage substance use or other issues.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. That might mean he's using it as a coping mechanism rather than a problem. However, past drug use is still concerning because being in a situation where you have no alternative but to use drugs could increase the risk of further issues if not addressed properly.\n\nLiving alone without a support network\u2014no mention of family or friends\u2014but he was raised with his mother in a household of four. That might suggest some level of support initially, but now living alone could lead to isolation and increased risk factors like substance abuse or lack of supervision.\n\nHis early life experiences being in an urban area with his biological mother\u2014could indicate exposure to certain environments that might have had negative impacts on his behavior or choices later on. Believing in God might mitigate some stressors, but if he's not actively using religion for coping, it might not be as helpful.\n\nPutting all these factors together: five prior arrests and convictions are high risk because they show a history of problematic behavior. Lack of education is medium to high risk since it can lead to unstable situations or substance abuse. Drug use without recent depression might indicate past issues but could also suggest ongoing problems if not addressed.\n\nConsidering each factor, the high number of arrests and convictions points towards a high relative weight for this person's risk. The lack of education adds another layer, making it medium. The living situation alone doesn't jump to high unless combined with other factors like substance use or unstable employment.\n\nSo, combining these, I think his overall risk is high because the arrest history and education level are strong indicators of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"A history of multiple arrests and convictions significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and may contribute to substance abuse or unstable employment, both linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"While he has used marijuana in the past four years, not feeling depressed recently suggests that drug use might be a coping mechanism rather than a serious issue.
