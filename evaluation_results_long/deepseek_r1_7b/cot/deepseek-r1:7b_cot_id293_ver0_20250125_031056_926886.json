    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22, which might be considered low compared to other risk assessments but could still indicate he\u2019s more adaptable and less likely to have long-term issues. He's white, but race doesn't directly predict recidivism unless there are systemic issues involved here, which isn't mentioned, so I'll note that as neutral.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction, so it's a minor offense. That might be a low risk factor because not getting convicted could mean he didn\u2019t face significant consequences beyond the arrest. But since it happened in his past, maybe it's still relevant.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so those factors are probably low.\n\nHe\u2019s married living with his spouse\u2014stability from a supportive household might reduce risk, so that could be low or medium depending on other factors.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college: Maybe some educational gap but without further info, it's neutral. If anything, maybe lower risk because he has completed basic education.\n\nHe\u2019s held two jobs during the year\u2014work history is positive for stability, so probably a low factor.\n\nDrug use past four years (marijuana) and recent feelings of depression in the last month. Drug use can be risky; even if it's marijuana, which isn't as severe as other drugs, it could still affect judgment and behavior. The recent feelings of down mood might indicate a potential for decreased motivation or willingness to engage positively.\n\nYoung household size\u2014six people at his young age: Maybe indicating a lot of support initially, but without knowing dynamics, it\u2019s neutral. Could be either high or low depending on context, but since it's just stated as such, I'll consider it neutral.\n\nBelieves God has no role in his life: This might influence his personal motivation and decision-making. If he doesn't see a higher power influencing his choices, maybe it affects his behavior towards positive outcomes like seeking help for substance abuse or avoiding criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, the most significant factors seem to be his recent drug use (high risk) and any indication of mental health issues (medium risk). The rest don't add up strongly. So overall, I\u2019d lean towards a medium-high risk but perhaps not extremely high since he's relatively stable in other areas.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"His only arrest was not convictions, which typically indicates lower recidivism risk compared to more severe or repeated offenses.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana along with recent feelings of depression may increase the risk of substance abuse and related behavioral issues that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental health indicators\", \"medium\", \"Recent mood swings could signal potential behavioral changes or increased vulnerability to stressors, which might influence criminal behavior over time.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
