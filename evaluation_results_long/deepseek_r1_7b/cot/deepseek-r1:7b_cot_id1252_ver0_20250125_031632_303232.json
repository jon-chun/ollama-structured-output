    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history of one arrest but no conviction. That might be a red flag because even though it's not a conviction, it could indicate past behavior that led to the arrest. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe's 6'8\" and weighs 145 lbs. I'm not sure how weight affects recidivism directly, but his height is quite tall; perhaps he's muscular or has health issues. Not sure if that's relevant here though.\n\nLiving alone might be a factor because living with someone can provide support and reduce stress, which could lower the risk of reoffending. So maybe low to medium risk from this factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism rates because it provides skills and opportunities. So lack of education might increase his risk\u2014maybe medium.\n\nHe has two jobs during the year. Having multiple income sources can help with financial stability, which could reduce the urge to commit crimes for money. So maybe low risk from employment.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014he used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both positive and negative effects.Marijuana might be a minor substance use issue, so perhaps medium impact on recidivism compared to more severe drug habits.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression over the past month. If he's feeling good mentally, it might indicate better mental health, which is protective against recidivism. So maybe low risk from this factor.\n\nYoung age and living with his biological mother in a household of four at an early age could mean he was raised in a multi-generation household. This might influence his behavior but I'm not sure if it's positive or negative. Maybe medium risk since it doesn't directly correlate to higher recidivism rates, but it's something to consider.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide coping mechanisms and guidance, so maybe a slight protective factor\u2014low risk here.\n\nPutting all these together: Medium risk because of the arrest history, lack of education, living alone might be a bit contradictory, but his positive factors like employment and mental health could balance it out. Maybe 60% confidence that he will rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (1 time, no conviction)\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one arrest without a conviction, which may indicate past behavior leading to the arrest but not necessarily future recidivism.
