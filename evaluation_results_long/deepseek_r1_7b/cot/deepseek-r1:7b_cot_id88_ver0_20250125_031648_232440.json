    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assign relative weights to each risk factor for a 19-year-old male with a high recidivism risk over the next three years. The factors include multiple arrests, lack of education, living situation, drug use, family background, and religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the given factors:\n\n- **Multiple Arrests (10)**: High risk because more past convictions indicate poorer behavior control.\n- **No Education**: Medium to high risk; lack of skills can lead to unstable employment or substance abuse.\n- **Living Alone**: Medium risk; living with family reduces supervision, but it's not as significant as having a support network.\n- **Drug Use (Marijuana/Cocaine)**: High risk; drug use is linked to poor decision-making and increased recidivism rates.\n- **Family History ( lived with mother in urban area at young age)**: Medium risk; early family issues might suggest behavioral problems but not necessarily high risk unless combined with other factors.\n- **Religious Beliefs**: Low impact on recidivism directly, but could relate to personal values or support systems.\n\nConsidering the factors together, multiple arrests and lack of education are strong indicators. Drug use is also significant. The family background adds some weight but less than the arrest and education factors. Living alone doesn't add much risk compared to other factors. Religious beliefs have minimal impact here.\n\nPutting it all together, this individual has several high-risk factors: multiple arrests (high), lack of education (medium), drug use (high). These factors collectively point towards a high probability of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate past behavior issues and lack of control, significantly increasing the risk of future crimes and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no_education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education often correlates with unstable employment or substance abuse, which are risk factors for recidivism.

He has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
