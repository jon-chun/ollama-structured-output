    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearrest based on his history. He's been arrested twice and convicted once, which is a red flag because recidivism often increases with prior convictions.\n\nHe's white, but I don't think that has much to do here; race usually isn't a direct factor unless there's some systemic bias, which isn't indicated here. His height and weight aren't relevant for risk assessment in this context.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. While living arrangements can sometimes correlate with support systems, in his case, he's an only child or perhaps part of a larger household? Wait, no\u2014he mentioned that at a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of 5. So that's more than just living alone; it was a bigger family structure.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college\u2014so maybe less support from higher education institutions or community resources.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive, but if he's been unemployed for a while, that might indicate lack of skills or motivation to change his situation.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That\u2019s interesting because substance use can sometimes correlate with other negative behaviors, but since he didn't feel depressed, it might not be a significant factor here.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and considers that his personal beliefs don't influence his actions. This could relate to his motivation or past behavior; if he's religiously influenced before, now it might mean he's more self-driven. But I'm not sure how much this affects recidivism rates.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are a big issue\u2014two convictions increase the risk. Living with both parents in a large household at 19 could indicate strong family support, which is usually protective. However, his lack of job experience and skills might make him more susceptible to issues that led to prior offenses.\n\nHis drug use doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it's linked to previous behavior or current triggers. His recent positive affect (not feeling depressed) suggests he's in a better mental state recently, which could be a mitigating factor if the drugs weren't causing problems then.\n\nConsidering all these factors: Prior convictions are high risk. Drug use is low to medium but doesn't seem severe. Unemployment or lack of work experience might add some risk if it's recent or if he has skills that aren't used elsewhere. Living with family could be protective, so maybe lower risk in that aspect.\n\nSo weighing each factor: Prior convictions (high), unemployment (medium), drug use (low). The rest don't seem to contribute much positively. Therefore, the overall prediction would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior convictions increase the likelihood of recidivism as past behavior patterns often repeat.\"),\n    (\"unemployment_or_employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Employment status can influence recidivism; holding two jobs may indicate potential for positive change but if recent or skills are underutilized, it could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years with no recent depression suggests it is not a significant current risk factor but history might play a role if linked to prior offenses.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
