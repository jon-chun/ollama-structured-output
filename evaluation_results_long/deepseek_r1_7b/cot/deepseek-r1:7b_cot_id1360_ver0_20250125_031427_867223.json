    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate the risk factors for a 22-year-old Black female who hasn't been convicted but has two arrests. Let's break down each factor.\n\nFirst, her lack of convictions despite two arrests might indicate she's not taking the law seriously. That could be a low or medium risk because she's avoiding facing the consequences.\n\nHer height isn't mentioned, so I don't know if that relates to anything relevant here.\n\nNever married and living alone... Well, being single can sometimes lead to higher recidivism rates due to isolation, but it might also depend on her support system. She doesn't have a diploma or GED, which is a red flag for employability\u2014low risk because she might struggle with getting ahead.\n\nNo job during the year means she's not actively seeking help or opportunities. That's another low factor since lack of income can lead to higher crime rates and dependency issues.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) could be a medium risk, especially if she's using it recreationally without abstinence. Past drug use can contribute to unstable behavior.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed last month; sometimes substance abuse can mask mental health issues or vice versa, so this might not directly correlate but is somewhat neutral.\n\nGrowing up in a household of two with her mother could have both positive and negative influences. Some family dynamics might support stability, but without more info on that environment's impact, it's hard to assess\u2014maybe low risk if the environment was stable.\n\nShe believes in God, which generally supports moral behavior but varies based on personal beliefs and context.\n\nPutting this all together: two arrests with no convictions (low), no diploma/GED (low), no job (low), moderate drug use (medium). Her living situation and family background are neutral. So the overall risk is medium-low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"low\", \"Her two arrests, though not convictions, suggest she may avoid taking a serious approach to legal issues which could indicate lower recidivism risk compared to someone with convictions but no prior offense]],\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED indicates potential challenges in finding gainful employment and reintegration into society, which might increase her risk of reoffending)),\n    (\"joblessness\", \"low\", \"Not holding a job during the year suggests she is not actively seeking opportunities for improvement, potentially contributing to higher recidivism rates by being more vulnerable to adverse influences or situations that may lead to criminal behavior\")),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years could indicate potential drug-related issues, which have been linked to higher rates of substance abuse and subsequently higher recidivism risk compared to non-users but not as significant as other factors like previous convictions or lack of education)),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother at a young age in a household of two could suggest some level of stability, though without more context on family dynamics, this factor is considered low risk compared to other factors like prior arrests or lack of education)),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"neutral\", \"No mention of significant mental health issues; drug use and lack of depression over the past month could indicate that any underlying mental health concerns are not currently affecting her behavior in a way that would directly contribute to recidivism but also do not necessarily suggest improved mental health either\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
