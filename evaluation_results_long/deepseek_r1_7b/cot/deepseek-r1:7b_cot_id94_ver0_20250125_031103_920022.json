    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the relative weights of each risk factor for this 19-year-old male trying to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's Black. I remember that there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but how does that affect recidivism? I think being Black can increase the risk slightly because of systemic issues like over-policing and biased law enforcement practices, which might make someone more likely to be arrested or receive harsher sentences.\n\nNext, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's definitely a high risk factor because prior convictions are strongly correlated with recidivism. Each previous offense increases the chances of getting another one.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and weight is 178 lbs. I don't know if these physical attributes directly contribute to recidivism, but maybe being an adult isn't a factor here since he's already 19. Maybe his weight could relate to health issues that might affect his ability to reintegrate after incarceration, but it doesn't directly predict rearrest.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which he admitted to experiencing. Loneliness often correlates with substance abuse and other risk behaviors, increasing the chance of reoffending.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school or going to college might mean he doesn't have the necessary skills for employment, making him more vulnerable to engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nNot working during the past year could lead to dependency on substance abuse as a coping mechanism. If someone isn't employed, they might turn to drugs to cope with stress or boredom, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance use, especially cannabis, is linked to higher rates of recidivism because it often leads to risky behaviors like alcohol abuse or not seeking help for mental health issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area. Growing up in an environment where he had limited contact with his father could lead to emotional neglect and behavioral issues, which might contribute to substance use and other problematic behaviors later on.\n\nLastly, he believes in God but feels sometimes down. While religious beliefs can provide coping mechanisms, if someone is feeling low without a productive outlet, it might indicate underlying mental health issues that could increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor seems to contribute significantly to his likelihood of rearrest. The prior conviction alone is high. His living situation and feelings of depression and loneliness are medium factors. Racial background, lack of education, substance use, and emotional neglect are all likely contributing to a high risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Racial Background\", \"high\", \"A Black individual may face systemic issues like over-policing and biased enforcement, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest with a conviction significantly raises the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone & Loneliness\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, which are linked to substance abuse and risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Educational Attainment\", \"high\", \"Not having a GED and not pursuing college may limit opportunities and contribute to risky behavior patterns.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Not working during the year could lead to dependency on substances as a coping mechanism, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use & Depression\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of depression can lead to risky behaviors like alcohol abuse or not seeking help for mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"Childhood Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area at a young age might result in emotional neglect, contributing to behavioral issues later on.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Religious belief may provide coping mechanisms but without support, feelings of low can indicate mental health issues that may lead to reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
