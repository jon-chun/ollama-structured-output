    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which is one factor that might lower his risk since a conviction leads to more serious penalties. His height and weight don't seem relevant here; maybe they're just personal info.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so no partner for potential substance abuse or dependency issues. His education level\u2014high school diploma with college enrollment\u2014is positive because higher education can lead to better job opportunities and lower recidivism. He has three jobs in the past year, which is good news; job stability often helps people stay on track.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong indicator of low risk compared to those who have used drugs. His recent feeling down might be temporary, but it's important to consider if that's related to substance abuse or other mental health issues.\n\nHe was a child raised by four parents in an urban area\u2014maybe he had some exposure to family dynamics which could affect his behavior later on. His religious beliefs might provide support and guidance, potentially reducing risk factors like drug use or emotional issues.\n\nPutting it all together, the positive factors like education, employment, lack of substance abuse, and living situation seem to indicate a low risk. So I'd predict he won't reoffend in three years with low confidence because the risk is minimal.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one non-convicted arrest, which suggests limited criminal history and potential for low re-arrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"high\", \"Employing three jobs in the past year indicates a stable income source, which can reduce financial stress and re-offending tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests minimal risk of substance abuse issues contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less support network, but it also shows self-reliance which is a positive factor in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma with college enrollment suggests a path towards better opportunities and reduced involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Health\", \"low\", \"Feeling down for extended periods without addressing underlying issues could lead to increased stress or substance use, but no recent drug use is noted.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Exposure to family dynamics from an early age may indicate potential behavioral patterns that could contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 10\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
