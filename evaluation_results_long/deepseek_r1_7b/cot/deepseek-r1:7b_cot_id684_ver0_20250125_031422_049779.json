    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: He has one arrest and a conviction. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strong indicators of past behavior that could lead to more offenses.\n\nHis weight is 230 lbs at 5'11\". Not sure how that factors in yet; maybe relates to other aspects like physical activity or health, but it might not directly influence recidivism much unless there's a history of substance abuse linked to his weight.\n\nHe's living alone, which could mean he has less support and might be more susceptible to stressors. But he's never been married, so that might not add any additional risk factors here.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Maybe some educational barriers or lack of skills that could impede his ability to reintegrate successfully after incarceration.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having worked a few jobs shows adaptability, which is positive. But maybe it also means he has some financial stability, reducing the need for illegal activities.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct risk factor, but sometimes substance abuse can lead to other issues like theft or violence, which could affect his future behavior.\n\nHe felt no depression over the past month despite living alone. That's positive as it suggests he's mentally stable and less likely to engage in harmful behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. That might indicate family issues or potential abuse, which can increase risk factors like anxiety or substance use.\n\nHe believes in God, which is generally protective but could also be linked to other risk behaviors if he's inconsistent.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest and conviction are strong red flags (high risk). His living situation at a young age adds some moderate risk. The lack of a college degree isn't as concerning unless it's impacting his ability to find better opportunities, but that's less direct.\n\nHis job history is positive, but the drug use might suggest some instability or addiction issues without clear negative impact on recidivism yet.\n\nSo overall, considering all factors, I think he has a high risk of reoffending in three years.\n</think>\n\nThe individual exhibits several risk factors. The prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending (high). His young age and living with his mother suggest potential instability (medium). While his job history is positive, substance use without clear negative impact may indicate underlying issues (low to medium). Overall, considering all factors, I assign a high relative weight.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has one prior arrest and conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending in the future.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in a household of five suggests potential family issues or abuse, increasing moderate risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use History\", \"low\", \"Drug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine) without recent negative impact on mental health does not directly indicate current substance use issues but could be linked to prior behavior that may affect future stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
