    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a White female with two prior arrests and a conviction. Recidivism is more common among people with criminal history, so that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHer demographics: age 19 isn't too old, but being an adult who has been arrested twice might mean she's had some time to reflect or maybe not take things seriously now. Being White could influence perceptions, but in this case, it's her personal history that matters more.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and 130 lbs, which is a bit on the lighter side. Weight doesn't usually predict recidivism unless it's related to past behavior or health issues she might have had from drug use.\n\nMarital status: she's never been married and isn't living alone. Maybe living with others could provide support, but if she's not engaged in any positive activities, that's a red flag. However, being single doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there are personal issues.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Completing education is generally associated with lower recidivism because it can lead to better job opportunities and stable living situations. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs shows some responsibility, but if she's been unemployed for long periods or if the work was at minimum wage, that could affect her stability. Also, job changes can sometimes lead to stress or new drug-related issues.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, and may lead to more criminal activity as she tries to recover.\n\nHer recent emotional state: she hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression isn't always directly linked to recidivism, chronic stress or anxiety might be associated with substance use issues. However, this factor seems less relevant compared to drug use history.\n\nLiving situation: at a young age, she lived in a household of five. Larger households can sometimes correlate with higher risk of exposure to negative influences or environments conducive to drug use and unstable situations.\n\nHer belief in God: She considers God has nothing to do with her personal events. This could indicate a lack of spirituality or support system which might be linked to substance abuse issues, as some religious groups provide support for recovery.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards high risk except perhaps education level. However, drug use is a significant and persistent issue that strongly increases the likelihood of recidivism. The belief in God isn't directly tied to criminal behavior but could be an indirect factor through other issues like substance abuse. Therefore, despite some mitigating factors, the overall risk seems high enough for cautious prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has a history of criminal behavior with two prior arrests and a conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Her use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a strong indicator of substance abuse, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not being married and living with others could provide support but may also be indicative of underlying personal issues that could affect her stability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Completing high school without college enrollment suggests she has the capacity to seek better opportunities, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs might indicate some responsibility but could also suggest periods of instability or underemployment that may contribute to substance use and risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests she is maintaining emotional stability, which is a positive factor in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living with five members could indicate exposure to environments conducive to substance use and other negative influences.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Her lack of belief might not directly correlate with criminal behavior but could be linked to substance abuse issues through unmet spiritual needs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
