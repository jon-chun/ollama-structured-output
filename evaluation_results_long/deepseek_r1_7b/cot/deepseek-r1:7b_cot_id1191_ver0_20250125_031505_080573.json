    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of a 22-year-old Black male with a history of two arrests who has rearrest recidivism over three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: two arrests and a conviction. That's significant because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future crimes or reoffending.\n\nNext, his demographic factors\u2014age 22, Black identity\u2014he doesn't have any other family members living with him except for God. This might suggest he's somewhat detached from family support which can be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and only held one job recently. Joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates as it can lead to lack of purpose or unstable situations after release.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, which might indicate substance abuse issues. Substance use can contribute to criminal behavior and reduce self-control, increasing the risk.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone, which could mean he lacks support network that many people rely on for stability during challenging times.\n\nHe considered God as part of his personal life but hasn't felt depressed recently. This might suggest some level of spirituality or mental health issues if there were any depression-related problems.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrest convictions, joblessness, substance use, living alone\u2014all these factors point towards a higher risk of rearrest. Even though he's young and has no family support, the other factors are more significant in this case.\n</think>\n\nThe individual exhibits several risk factors that collectively suggest a high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n\n1. **Two prior arrests and a conviction**: This history indicates a tendency to engage in criminal behavior, raising concerns about recidivism.\n2. **Demographic factors (age 22, Black identity) with living alone**: The solitary living situation can lead to feelings of alienation or instability, potentially influencing risk-taking behaviors.\n3. **High school diploma and lack of college enrollment, job history**: Limited educational attainment and employment may result in a sense of Aimlessness, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior post-release.\n4. **Drug use (marijuana) in past four years**: Substance abuse can impair judgment and self-control, contributing to criminal liability.\n\n**Prediction:** YES\n\nThe cumulative effect of these risk factors strongly indicates a high probability of rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_conviction\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of two arrests and one conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and demo\", \"low\", \"Age is not directly a risk factor, but living situation alone may be considered low compared to other factors.
