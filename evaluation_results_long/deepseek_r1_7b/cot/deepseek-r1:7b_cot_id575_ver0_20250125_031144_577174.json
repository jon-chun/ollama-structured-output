    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment for a 21-year-old male. First, I'll go through each factor one by one.\n\nHe has only been arrested once but not convicted. That's a positive sign because it might indicate he's actively seeking to change his behavior rather than just reacting to situations. So that should be low risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here. Maybe they could relate to other factors, but in this context, I think they're negligible.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. That doesn't necessarily predict future issues unless there are underlying family dynamics, which we don't have information on. So probably low risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending a 2-year college shows he's educated and likely to stay out of trouble educationally. Low risk here too.\n\nHe held four jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs usually indicates stability and responsibility, so that should be low.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is excellent; it's a strong indicator of self-discipline and lower likelihood of new substance issues. Definitely low risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month suggests he's mentally stable and proactive. That's another positive sign.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age might have social implications, but without knowing about family dynamics or support systems, it's hard to gauge higher risk here. Maybe medium since urban environments can be isolating sometimes.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with his life adds a positive spiritual element, which is usually linked to lower recidivism rates. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: no high-risk factors, mostly medium and low. The prediction leans towards low risk of rearrest, so I'll say \"NO\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"He has only been arrested once but not convicted, indicating potential for positive behavior change.\"),\n    (\"Marital and Living Status\", \"low\", \"Not being married and currently not living alone does not inherently indicate a high risk of reoffending without further context about family dynamics or support systems.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, suggesting stability and commitment to further education which can positively influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"He has held four jobs during the year, indicating solid employment history which can correlate with responsible decision-making and lower risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"He has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator of self-discipline and lower likelihood of substance abuse triggers.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, suggesting mental stability which can contribute to proactive behavior and lower risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing in Urban Area\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area at a young age may have social implications without additional context about family support or environment quality.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Consideration\", \"low\", \"Considering that God has something to do with his life is a positive indicator of spiritual stability and can be linked to lower recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
