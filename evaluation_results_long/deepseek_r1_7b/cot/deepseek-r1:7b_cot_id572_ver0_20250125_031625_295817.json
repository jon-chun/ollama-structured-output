    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this person rearresting within three years. Let's see... He's a 22-year-old male, White, with 3 prior arrests and convictions. That's pretty significant because recidivism tends to increase with more past offenses.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 160 lbs. Hmm, weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it affects his ability to commit crimes or get jobs, but I don't think that's the case here. Maybe not relevant enough to rate a high weight.\n\nLiving alone without a spouse is a bit concerning. Living arrangements can influence how he might interact with others and seek help after being released. But again, maybe not a top factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college could mean limited opportunities or support system, which might increase risk if he doesn't have resources to stay out of trouble.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs in the past year. That seems okay, as having some work experience can show stability. But if he's been unemployed for longer periods, that could be a problem. Not sure about this one yet.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is definitely a red flag because it can impair judgment, lead to substance abuse issues, and increase impulsivity or aggression towards others. That should probably be high weight.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month. Hmm, that's interesting. If he hasn't felt down recently, maybe he's more motivated towards positive actions or seeking help. Or perhaps he's avoiding negative emotions because of his drug use. Either way, it might not directly correlate with recidivism but could influence his willingness to change.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four in a rural area at a young age. That suggests he was part of a larger family without parents around when he was younger. This could have emotional or social implications; maybe he's more dependent on someone else, which could contribute to recidivism if he doesn't seek help upon release.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with his personal events. That might indicate a lack of belief in free will or determinism, which some might interpret as a lack of responsibility towards others. However, it's more about his personal philosophy and less about risk directly.\n\nPutting all this together: His prior convictions (high), drug use (high), and living situation (medium) are the biggest factors. The rest don't seem to add much weight. So combining these, I'd predict a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions which significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years can impair cognitive functions, lead to substance abuse issues, and increase impulsivity or aggression towards others, all of which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse may influence interactions with others and access to support systems, but this factor is less directly related to criminal behavior compared to prior arrests or drug use.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma does not inherently indicate a lack of resources or opportunities; however, it may also suggest limited college attendance which could affect job prospects and stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
