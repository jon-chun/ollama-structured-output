    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to assess the risk of this 19-year-old female rearresting within three years. She's white, has a criminal history with one arrest and conviction, is single living alone, has a high school diploma but isn't in college, worked four jobs in a year, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) both recently and long ago, feels down sometimes, lived in a household of four when young, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, her criminal history: one arrest and conviction. That's a solid foundation for concern because prior convictions are strong indicators of past behavior that could recur.\n\nHer age is 19, which might suggest she's still developing her skills, but she has a high school diploma, so maybe she's working to improve. However, being employed full-time while managing a job and personal life can sometimes indicate she's proactive about her situation.\n\nShe's single and living alone. Living alone can mean she's responsible or perhaps lacks support that might help with substance use or other issues. But it could also mean she's isolated, which isn't necessarily bad but could be related to past drug use.\n\nHer job history: four jobs in a year shows some adaptability, but if she's using drugs regularly, it might interfere with her ability to perform these jobs effectively, especially if they require multitasking or stability. This could lead to ongoing issues that contribute to recidivism.\n\nDrug use is a significant risk factor. She used marijuana and cocaine both recently and in the past four years. Substance abuse can impair judgment, decision-making, and relationships. It often leads to unstable behavior which could increase the chances of reoffending.\n\nFeeling down and sometimes not being able to find joy suggests she might be experiencing emotional distress or low self-esteem. This could affect her motivation to change or seek help, potentially leading to further issues like drug use or involvement in the criminal justice system again.\n\nHer past household size at four is a bit concerning because larger families can sometimes correlate with more support and betterment, but it's also possible that she felt part of a group without direct supervision. However, this alone isn't enough to predict recidivism unless there's a history of family issues.\n\nBelieving in God might indicate a strong moral compass or personal values, which could help her stay on track if she chooses to use those principles to guide her. It adds a positive factor that could mitigate some risks.\n\nPutting it all together: The prior arrest is a high risk because one conviction can predict higher recidivism rates compared to no criminal history. Drug use and recent emotional distress are moderate factors. Her job history, living alone, education level, family size, and belief in God balance things out but don't negate the high and moderate factors.\n\nSo, her overall risk is likely high because of the prior arrest and drug use despite some mitigating positive factors like her education and belief in God.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"Her one prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism compared to individuals without a criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"moderate\", \"Regular substance use, particularly within the past four years and recent months, indicates potential relapse and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"moderate\", \"Feeling down and lack of joy may signal underlying issues that could impact her ability to change behavior or seek help effectively.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Having worked four jobs shows adaptability, though drug use may interfere with job performance and contribute to ongoing issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living independently can sometimes indicate self-sufficiency but may also correlate with isolation leading to substance use issues if not properly supported.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment suggests she is actively working towards improvement, which could positively influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of four doesn't inherently predict higher risk unless there's a history of family dysfunction or support issues.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Strong moral compass may help her stay on track if she chooses to use religion for guidance and personal values.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
