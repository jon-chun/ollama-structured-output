    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this person. Let's break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old Black male who has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of future rearrest. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe weighs 155 lbs and is 5 feet 10 inches tall. That doesn't immediately raise concerns about physical factors, but it's not particularly notable either. Maybe his weight isn't an issue here unless there's other info on health or substance use.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates because of the lack of support system which might contribute to substance abuse or other negative behaviors. So that's another high risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. GED holders often face barriers to employment, which could mean less access to job training programs, potentially leading to higher recidivism if not addressed. This is definitely a medium to high weight factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to increased substance use and other risky behaviors. Since he's not working, this could be another high risk factor.\n\nHe uses marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially cannabis, has been linked to higher recidivism rates due to potential substance abuse problems, which can affect employability and personal stability. This is a high weight factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but he has used drugs for more than four years. The history of drug use might indicate ongoing issues that could lead to relapse or further criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with a household of size 4. Household size can influence family support and stability, which in turn affects recidivism. A larger household might mean less individual responsibility, so this is probably a medium weight factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal happenstance. This belief could provide some moral support but doesn't directly correlate with higher or lower recidivism rates unless it's affecting his behavior, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest, lack of job, drug use, living alone, and GED without college enrollment are strong indicators pointing towards higher recidivism. The household size is a bit inconclusive but doesn't tip the scale as much. All these factors combined make me lean towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment can lead to increased substance use and other negative behaviors that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use is associated with higher rates of substance abuse, which can impact employability and personal stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may provide fewer social supports, potentially leading to increased risky behaviors such as drug use or other negative outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED without college enrollment may limit access to job training and resources that could aid in reducing recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 17\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 4 might indicate less individual responsibility, which can influence behavior over time but is not directly linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may provide some moral support, but without evidence of its direct impact on behavior, this factor has minimal weight.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
