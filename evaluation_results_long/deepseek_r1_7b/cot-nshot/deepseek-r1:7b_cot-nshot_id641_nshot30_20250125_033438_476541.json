    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old female based on her risk factors. Let me go through each of the provided examples to see how similar cases were predicted.\n\nFirst, looking at the case details: She's White, 5'8\", 120 lbs, never married, living alone, has a GED but isn't enrolled in college, held 3 jobs, no drug use, and sometimes feels down. Her background is with her biological mother in an urban area, household size 2, and she believes God doesn't influence her life.\n\nNow, I'll compare this to the examples given earlier. In example 7, a similar White female with a GED, no living situation issues, but more job stability had a YES outcome. Example 10 is another White female with similar stats as this case but had a NO. Example 28 has a high risk due to multiple convictions and drug use, predicted YES.\n\nHer low weight might be a red flag for recidivism, so I'll give that a medium weight because it's concerning but maybe not severe. Never been married could be a mitigating factor, so low weight.\n\nNo drug use is good; that's a no-brainer as high. Held 3 jobs during the year\u2014that's positive, so low risk here.\n\nHer emotional state sometimes being down might influence her stability, so medium weight because it's not consistent but could affect decisions.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in an urban area might have some context issues, but since she's never been married and living alone, maybe that's mitigated. GED is positive; not in college can be a risk factor if she doesn't get another degree, so medium weight here.\n\nHer belief in God could be either way depending on how that affects her motivation to change behavior, but since it's stated as nothing, maybe low impact\u2014so low weight.\n\nPutting this all together, the most significant factors are her low weight and no drug use. Her lack of a stable living situation might not be as bad if she has job experience. Since she held 3 jobs, that's a strong positive, which should lower the risk. However, sometimes feeling down could indicate underlying issues.\n\nComparing to example 27: She had some similar factors but without holding any jobs and had drug use, leading to NO outcome. This case is better in job count and no drugs, so maybe she has a low chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is significantly below average for her height (120 lbs vs the average for a 5'8\\\" female), which could indicate potential health issues that might contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, especially at such a young age without any children or support network, may increase stress levels and risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED can sometimes indicate past difficulties in obtaining higher education, which might be a mitigating factor if she pursues further education but could also suggest ongoing challenges.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding 3 jobs during the year suggests stability and responsibility, which are positive indicators for reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong positive indicator of lower risk compared to those who have used drugs as per examples with similar factors like example 28 who had YES outcomes despite other issues.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down occasionally can indicate possible mood swings or underlying stressors that might affect decision-making and behavior but isn't a definitive indicator of recidivism.\"), \n    (\"Biological Mother Living in Household (Household Size 2)\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother, especially in an urban area, could provide emotional support and reduce stress levels, contributing to lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence on Personal Life\", \"low\", \"Not believing that God has a significant influence on her personal life suggests she may have more autonomy or less dependency on external factors for motivation or stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
