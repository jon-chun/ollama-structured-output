    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to predict whether this 21-year-old Hispanic male will be rearrested within three years. Let's break down the risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of being arrested seven times but hasn't been convicted yet. That seems like a significant risk factor because multiple arrests without a conviction often indicate that he might not take responsibility or could continue causing problems if released.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 215 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a factor, but since he's attending a 2-year college, maybe his weight isn't directly contributing to recidivism here unless it's related to substance use, which I don't see evidence of yet.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living arrangements without a support system could increase the risk of reoffending because there might be fewer people to turn to for help or support after getting in trouble again.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this is actually a protective factor. But since he's still in school, maybe he's more motivated to change his behavior.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to financial instability and increased temptation to turn to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years might indicate occasional drug use, which could contribute to risk-taking behavior or substance abuse issues that might escalate.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, so no signs of mental health issues that could affect his ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four. A larger household can sometimes provide more support but might also indicate a lack of stability if living conditions are poor or unsupportive.\n\nHe believes in God, which is a positive factor as it shows he has personal accountability and support system within his faith.\n\nPutting this all together, the multiple arrests, lack of a stable environment, substance use, and limited employment all point towards a higher risk of rearrest. However, his educational background and belief in God are mitigating factors. I think the overall risk is high but not certain because there's some positive factors at play.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here is the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Multiple Arrests**: 7 arrests without a conviction significantly increase the risk of reoffending due to potential lack of responsibility or previous behavior patterns.\n\n2. **Weight and Living Situation**: Being 6'2\" and weighing 215 lbs with no marital status and living alone may indicate instability, increasing recidivism chances.\n\n3. **Employment Status**: Employed in college suggests some motivation but only one job during the year might lead to financial strain and risky behavior.\n\n4. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use can contribute to risk-taking behaviors or substance abuse issues.\n\n5. **Education and Belief**: High school diploma with enrollment in college is protective, though not directly mitigating rearrest if other factors are destabilizing.\n\n**Prediction**: The individual has a high risk of rearrest due to multiple arrests, instability, and substance use, despite positive factors like education and belief in God.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests without convictions significantly increase the risk of reoffending as they often indicate potential lack of responsibility or previous problematic behavior.\"),\n    (\"weight_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no marital status and a history of weight-related issues may contribute to instability, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employed in college but holding only one job during the year might lead to financial strain or increased temptation for risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Past marijuana use can indicate occasional substance abuse, which may contribute to risk-taking behaviors or escalation of issues.\"),\n    (\"education_and_belief\", \"low\", \"While holding a high school diploma and enrolled in college, the lack of direct mitigating factors like reintegration support might not fully offset other destabilizing factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
