    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which is a significant risk factor right there. At 5 feet 11 inches and weighing between 200-224 lbs, he might be in an AVL or have some weight-related issues, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, so no family support which could help him. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, indicating limited education which can contribute to recidivism. Not holding any jobs during the year suggests he has little income or social support, making reintegration harder.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years; however, since it's non-violent, maybe not as concerning as harder drugs. He hasn't felt depressed recently, so that factor might be low here. At a young age, living in a household of 11 people is unusual\u2014maybe indicative of unstable family life or high dependency, which could affect his behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, he's got multiple red flags: prior convictions, lack of education and employment, living alone with a large household, and drug use. These points suggest a higher risk of rearrest. I think the confidence here is pretty high because so many risk factors are pointing towards reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted for two prior offenses, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college further indicates limited educational opportunities and resources that could aid in successful reintegration and prevention of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held during the year suggests instability, potential lack of income support, and increased vulnerability to environmental factors that may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"dwelling_size\", \"high\", \"Living alone in a household of 11 people is unusual and could indicate unstable family dynamics or high dependency on others, increasing chances of engaging in risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years does not necessarily correlate with violent recidivism but may be linked to other behavioral issues.
