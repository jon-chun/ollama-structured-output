    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm going to analyze each risk factor provided for the 19-year-old male and determine their relative weights\u2014low, medium, or high.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested 4 times with a conviction. Repeated arrests are definitely a strong indicator of recidivism because it shows previous involvement in criminal activities. So this should be a high weight.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 190 lbs. While weight can be an indicator, his height is above average but not particularly concerning unless there's associated health issues, which aren't mentioned here. So I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nNever been married: Lack of marriage doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, so this might have a low to no impact. Maybe even a non-relevant factor, so perhaps low.\n\nCurrently living alone: Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a direct indicator unless there are other factors like substance use or unstable environments. In this case, since he's a White male, maybe it's slightly medium because being alone might contribute to stressors that could lead to recidivism.\n\nEnrolled in school: This is a positive factor as education can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. However, since he's 19 and has previous arrests, perhaps this mitigates some risk but doesn't eliminate it entirely. So maybe medium weight.\n\nHeld 3 jobs during the year: Having stable employment history is generally good for recidivism rates because job training can help in reintegration after incarceration. However, if he's been arrested multiple times, this could be a balancing factor. I'll lean towards medium weight.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine): Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities again, so this should have a high weight.\n\nNot felt depressed over the past month: Since he's not experiencing depression, this suggests some level of mental health stability, which can aid in reintegration. So maybe low to medium weight.\n\nLiving in group quarters with household size 4 in an urban area: Co-living arrangements don't inherently correlate with higher or lower risk unless there are specific issues like high crime areas or unsafe environments. Urban settings can sometimes have higher concentrations of crime, so this might be a slightly medium factor but not the highest.\n\nConsidering God has nothing to do with his personal matters: This indicates a lack of religious support system, which could affect his ability to seek help or maintain stability. So low weight here because it's more about personal factors that might aid in recidivism prevention efforts.\n\nNow, compiling all these factors:\n\nHigh weights:\n- Arrests and convictions (high)\n- Drug use (high)\n\nMedium weights:\n- Living alone\n- Education and employment\n- Previous living situation\n\nLow weights:\n- Height\n- Marriage status\n- Depression status\n- Group quarters\n\nConsidering the high weight on previous arrests and drug use, which are strong indicators of recidivism. Even though he's enrolled in school and living alone, these factors might not offset the significant risk from his arrest history and substance abuse.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together, I predict a \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest recidivism with high confidence because the most impactful factors are pointing towards reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Repetitive criminal behavior history is strongly associated with recidivism, indicating a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse significantly increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities again, contributing to high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be associated with increased stressors that might lead to recidivism, though not directly proportional to risk without additional factors like substance use or instability.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Enrolled in school may offer education and skills beneficial for reintegration but does not fully mitigate the impact of prior arrests and substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Reiterates the high risk associated with substance abuse, further increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
