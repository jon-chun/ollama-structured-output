    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether this 21-year-old man will be rearrested within three years. He's white, arrested once and convicted. His height is 6 feet 0 inches, over 250 lbs\u2014so quite heavy. He's never married and living alone, which might indicate some social or personal issues.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That's a big risk factor because education can influence both his ability to find employment post-release and his willingness to re-enter the workforce respectfully. Plus, he's only held one job during the year\u2014he might not have much experience or support system.\n\nHe's been using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is linked to various problems like strained relationships, health issues, and maybe even violence, which can contribute to recidivism. Also, not feeling depressed for a month could be tricky\u2014it suggests he's maintaining an optimistic outlook despite his challenges, but it might also mean he's avoiding issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four when young. That's another red flag because living with multiple siblings can sometimes lead to family dysfunction or neglect if there are issues within the family unit.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal happenstance, which could mean he might struggle with making positive choices or seeking help from religious support when needed.\n\nPutting this all together: His heavy weight and lack of education make him physically and mentally at a disadvantage. The drug use and living situation suggest past issues that could resurface. Even though he's not feeling depressed recently, his past behavior points to potential future problems. Considering the examples given, people with multiple arrests, heavy demographics, and significant risk factors like drug use often have higher recidivism rates. So, based on these factors, I'm leaning towards a high confidence that he will be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"He is 21 years old, which is within the typical age range for first-time offenders but may still pose significant risk due to inexperience and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest and conviction, indicating a clean record that could suggest stability and lower recidivism risk over time.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"high\", \"Over 250 lbs\u2014this weight may pose challenges with health and employment, potentially increasing rearrest risks.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college, which could limit opportunities for success and stability after release.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held only one job during the year\u2014lack of experience may hinder reintegration into the workforce and contribute to recidivism if previous work was unstable or unsatisfying.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which can lead to strained relationships, health issues, and may contribute to violent behavior that could result in rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone, which may lack social support networks that could help prevent isolation or potential delinquency.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of four at a young age\u2014family dynamics can sometimes lead to neglect if issues arise within the family unit but may not directly correlate with rearrest unless there are signs of dysfunction.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Does not believe that God has anything to do with his personal happenstance\u2014the lack of religious support could affect decision-making and seeking help when needed, potentially impacting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month\u2014consistent positive outlook may reduce stressors related to substance abuse or other issues but does not guarantee no underlying mental health concerns.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
