    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 21-year-old female will be rearrested within three years. She has several risk factors, and based on the examples provided, each of these factors contributes differently to her likelihood of recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's break down her background. She was arrested once but not convicted, which is a red flag because even if she wasn't convicted, having a criminal history can increase the chance of getting rearrested. So that might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. That's underweight for her age and height. Being underweight could lead to health issues which in turn affect recidivism rates. So maybe this is also a medium risk.\n\nShe has never been married, living alone\u2014this might indicate she's not surrounded by support, which can contribute to substance abuse or other issues leading to more offenses. Another medium factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education gaps can sometimes lead to unstable situations or lack of opportunities that could result in further crimes. So maybe another low to medium risk here.\n\nHolding four jobs during the year is actually positive because employment often leads to better life choices and financial stability, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. Wait, but she's currently living alone. Maybe not sure about this one\u2014maybe it's a lower risk factor since being employed can help with providing for herself, which might be mitigating.\n\nDrug use is a significant issue here. She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a major contributor to recidivism because it often leads to addiction issues, strained relationships, and higher chances of engaging in criminal activities again. This should definitely be a high risk factor.\n\nShe says she's not depressed now, but she felt down before. Sometimes past negative emotions can lead to substance use as a coping mechanism, which could contribute to more offenses or seeking help. Maybe this is a medium risk.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of six in an urban area could have implications on her mental health and support system. Urban environments might offer more opportunities for stressors but also maybe higher chances of engaging with the criminal justice system if she's vulnerable. This seems like a medium to high risk factor, considering family dynamics.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: medium (arrest), medium (underweight), medium (living alone), low (education), low (employment), high (drug use), medium (past depression). The high risk from drug use and the medium-high factors might pull this prediction towards a positive outcome. So, I think she has a higher chance of being rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has been arrested but not convicted\", \"medium\", \"Having an arrest record, even without a conviction, can increase the risk of future criminal behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Underweight (125-149 lbs)\", \"medium\", \"Underweight status may indicate health issues that could contribute to substance abuse or other behavioral issues leading to further offenses.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might be a contributing factor in substance use and unstable living conditions that could result in more criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without further education may indicate limited opportunities for betterment or support systems that could contribute to recidivism but is mitigated by education gaps leading to better life choices.\"),\n    (\"Held 4 jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Employment can provide stability and resources, which are positive factors in reducing recidivism risk.
