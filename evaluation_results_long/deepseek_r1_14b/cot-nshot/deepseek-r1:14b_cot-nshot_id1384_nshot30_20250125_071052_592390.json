    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 19-year-old American Indian woman will be rearrested within three years. Let's break down each risk factor and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Looking at previous cases, younger individuals seem more likely to recidivate, but in some cases, like Example 6 (age 20), it didn't lead to rearrest. So maybe age isn't the highest factor here.\n\nShe's identified as American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut. I don't recall any examples where ethnicity was a direct risk factor, so this might be low impact.\n\nArrest history: she's been arrested twice but not convicted. In Examples 15 and 29, people with multiple arrests or convictions were rearrested, but in Example 6, someone had two arrests without conviction and wasn't rearrested. So arrest history is probably medium because it's a factor, but not the strongest.\n\nEducation-wise, she doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. In Examples 15, 27, 29, lack of education was present but didn't always lead to rearrest. So maybe low impact as it's somewhat common among those in the examples.\n\nEmployment: She held one job during the year. In some cases like Example 6 and 30, people had jobs but were still rearrested. Others without jobs, like Example 27, weren't. So this might be low because employment status alone doesn't strongly predict recidivism.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. In almost all examples where drug use was present, there was a higher likelihood of rearrest (Examples 1-30). This seems like a high-risk factor because substance abuse often leads to criminal behavior.\n\nMental health: She felt down in the dumps some times. In Examples 7 and 29, individuals had mental health issues and were rearrested. So this is probably medium as it's an indicator but not the sole determinant.\n\nFamily background: she lived with her biological mother in a rural household of size 3. In previous examples, family dynamics didn't seem to have a direct impact on recidivism unless other factors like convictions or drug use were present. So this might be low.\n\nSpirituality: She considers God's role in her life. Examples didn't show a clear trend here; some with strong spirituality were rearrested, others weren't. Probably low impact as it varies.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factor is her recent drug use. Mental health and arrest history are medium, while age, education, employment, family background, and spirituality are lower. So I'd predict a higher likelihood of recidivism but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old; younger individuals may be more prone to recidivism, but examples show mixed outcomes\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Identified as American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut; no clear trend in examples linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrested twice without conviction; previous examples show arrest history can indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"No diploma/GED and not enrolled in college; education status alone is a moderate factor but not the strongest\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held 1 job during the year; employment may be somewhat protective, but not consistently across examples\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in past four years; drug use is strongly correlated with recidivism in previous cases\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Felt down in the dumps some times in the past month; mental health struggles can contribute to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in a rural household of size 3; family dynamics alone are not a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Considers God's role in her life; examples show varied outcomes regardless of spirituality\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
