    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 17 or 18 had varying outcomes. Sometimes they recidivated, sometimes not. So age might be a low factor here.\n\nShe's Black. In the previous cases, race didn't seem to directly influence the outcome; it was more about other factors. So I'll consider this as low impact.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. This seems like a minor issue since she wasn't convicted, so maybe low weight here.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so those are low.\n\nNever married and living alone. In examples, living alone didn't correlate much with rearrest, so low factor.\n\nHigh school diploma\u2014positive indicator but not strong on its own. So medium perhaps?\n\nShe held 3 jobs this year. That's a positive sign of stability, which might reduce recidivism. Medium weight here.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a risk factor. In examples, drug use often led to YES outcomes, so high weight.\n\nFeeling down sometimes\u2014this could indicate stress or potential for more negative behavior. Low impact but possible.\n\nLived with both parents in an urban area. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family support can be protective. So maybe medium.\n\nBelieves God is involved in her life. In examples, this was sometimes a factor but not the main one. I'll assign low weight.\n\nNow, considering all factors: she has some positives like employment and education, but also drug use and possible emotional issues. Her arrest history is minimal but she did use drugs, which is a strong indicator. The other factors are mixed. Overall, the risk seems moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18)\", \"low\", \"Youth can be both an advantage and disadvantage; some examples show recidivism but others don't.\"),\n    (\"Race (Black)\", \"low\", \"Race alone wasn't a determining factor in previous cases, though it may interact with other factors.\"),\n    (\"Arrest history (1 arrest, no conviction)\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction is less predictive of future behavior compared to convictions or multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight (5'7\\\", 120 lbs)\", \"low\", \"These physical attributes are not directly linked to recidivism risk in the provided examples.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (never married)\", \"low\", \"Unmarried status is common among young adults and doesn't strongly predict recidivism on its own.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (alone)\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate independence but wasn't a significant factor in previous cases' outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Education level (high school diploma)\", \"medium\", \"Having completed high school is generally seen as a protective factor against recidivism, though it's not the strongest indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"Employment status (held 3 jobs this year)\", \"medium\", \"Stable employment can be a strong protective factor against recidivism, but its impact may vary based on other factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana in past four years)\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially when combined with other issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental health/emotional state (feeling down sometimes)\", \"low\", \"Transient emotional states may contribute but are less predictive than more consistent mental health issues or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Family background (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)\", \"medium\", \"Urban living and family presence can be complex factors; while urban areas may have higher crime rates, family support can mitigate risk.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/religious beliefs (believes God is involved in her life)\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior but were not a primary factor in previous examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
