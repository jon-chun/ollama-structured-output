    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this 18-year-old White male will rearrest in the next three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight of low, medium, or high.\n\nFirst, he was arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, like Example 29 where someone had 17 arrests and 3 convictions but still the outcome was NO, it seems that prior arrests without conviction might not carry as much weight. So I'd say this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school. From the examples, being enrolled often led to lower recidivism rates. For instance, Example 26 had him enrolled and the prediction was NO. This should be a high positive factor, so I'll mark it as high.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment is generally seen as a protective factor against recidivism. However, having only one job might not be strong enough. So maybe medium here.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is definitely a good sign. In Examples like 1 and 6 where they had no drug use, outcomes were NO or low risk. This should be high positive as well, so high weight.\n\nHe's never been married, which might mean less responsibility but I don't know if that directly affects recidivism. It seems neutral, maybe low impact.\n\nCurrently living alone: in the examples, sometimes living alone was associated with higher risks, but others didn't show a strong correlation. Maybe medium here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area of size 5. Family support can be protective, so this is probably high positive.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him. In some examples, having a strong belief system was linked to lower recidivism, like Example 26 where it was present and outcome was NO. Here, the absence might be negative, so medium weight.\n\nNow, putting all these together: most factors are low or medium, except for school enrollment which is high positive. His lack of drug use and being enrolled in school are strong positives, while past arrest without conviction is a mild concern. Overall, it seems like his protective factors outweigh the riskier ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"low\", \"He has been arrested once but not convicted, which may indicate lower likelihood of future offenses compared to those with convictions\"),\n    (\"currently_enrolled_in_school\", \"high\", \"Enrollment in school is a strong protective factor against recidivism as it provides structure and opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job during the year suggests some stability, but more consistent employment might indicate lower risk\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use\", \"high\", \"No recent drug use reduces risk factors significantly as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"never_married\", \"low\", \"Marital status alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may have mixed implications; while independence is positive, lack of support networks could be negative\"),\n    (\"family_environment_young\", \"high\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in an urban area suggests a potentially stable early environment\"),\n    (\"spirituality_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in divine influence might not directly correlate but could impact personal coping mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
