    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The user has provided a detailed case of a 19-year-old male with several risk factors and wants me to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. They've given examples from previous cases, so I'll need to analyze those to understand the patterns.\n\nFirst, looking at the age: he's 19, which is young but typically an age where recidivism rates might be higher as individuals are still developing. However, in the examples, some younger individuals like 18 and 17 had outcomes of both YES and NO, so I'm not sure how much weight to give age alone.\n\nNext, he's been arrested 9 times and convicted. That's a significant number. In previous cases, high arrest counts (like 7 or 3) often led to a prediction of YES. So this seems like a strong indicator for recidivism\u2014probably a high-weight factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Many examples showed that lack of education was linked with higher recidivism. For instance, Example 27 had no jobs and low education, leading to NO. So I'll consider this a medium weight since it's important but not as strong as prior arrests.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is another red flag. Previous cases like Example 15 and 17 with no jobs had YES outcomes, so this should be a high-weight factor because employment can reduce recidivism chances.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014this is positive. In some examples, drug use was present but didn't always lead to rearrest. So I'll give this a low weight since it's a protective factor but not the most influential.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health can play a role, but without evidence of current issues, it might not impact as much. So low weight here.\n\nHe lives alone and has done so currently. In some cases, living alone was linked to recidivism (like Examples 15 and 27), but others didn't show this as a significant factor. I'll give it a medium weight since it's somewhat indicative but not the strongest.\n\nFamily background: lived with his biological mother in a large household of size 14 in an urban area. Previous cases showed that growing up in challenging environments could contribute to recidivism, so this is a medium-weight factor.\n\nLastly, he considers God important in his life. In some examples, spirituality was linked with lower recidivism (e.g., Example 26). So I'll assign a low weight here as it's a mitigating factor.\n\nNow, weighing all these factors: high for prior arrests and no job, medium for education level, living alone, family background, and low for others. Considering the arrest count is very high, I think this will push the prediction to YES, but other factors might temper it a bit. My confidence isn't extremely high because some protective factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \"9 prior arrests and convictions strongly indicate higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED, not enrolled in college may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year suggests potential for further criminal activity\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past 4 years is a positive indicator but not outweighing other factors\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in past month, which could have been a risk factor\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems and increase vulnerability to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a large urban household of size 14, indicating potential environmental challenges\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in his life, which could act as a mitigating factor but not necessarily strong enough to prevent recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
