    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 18-year-old male is likely to rearrest in the next three years based on his risk factors. Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples provided, several people had multiple arrests and convictions, which often led to a \"YES\" outcome. However, since this is just one arrest without a conviction, I think this factor might be low risk because there's no formal criminal record yet.\n\nNext, his weight is 220 lbs. In previous cases, weight alone didn't seem to impact the outcome much unless it was related to other factors like drug use or job status. So, maybe medium risk here since being overweight could relate to health issues but not directly to crime.\n\nHe's living alone, which in some examples correlated with higher recidivism because lack of support can lead to more criminal behavior. However, he's working three jobs, which is a positive sign indicating stability and responsibility. This might counterbalance the risk of living alone, so I'd rate this as low or medium depending on how much weight to give each.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college but is employed. Employment is generally seen as protective against recidivism because it provides income and structure. So, this should be a strong positive factor, maybe low risk here.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is definitely a plus. Drugs often lead to more criminal activity, so avoiding them reduces that risk. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good because mental health issues can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior. So, another low risk point here.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents might have some influence. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but having two parents could mean more support and stability. Looking at the examples, living in an urban area was often associated with higher recidivism, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe believes that God influences what happens to him, which in some cases indicates strong moral beliefs that might deter crime. However, this can also sometimes lead to radical behavior depending on interpretations. I'm not sure how significant this is, but perhaps low risk since it's more about personal belief than actual behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest (low), weight (medium if considering urban context), living alone vs. employment (possibly medium), education and job status (low), no drug use (low), mental health (low), family background (medium), and spirituality (low). \n\nLooking at the examples, someone with a single arrest but strong positive factors like employment and no drug use often had \"NO\" outcomes. His stable work situation and clean record despite one arrest make me lean towards NO for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History (1 arrest, no conviction)\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without a conviction is less indicative of future criminal behavior compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"Weight (220 lbs)\", \"medium\", \"While being overweight may indicate health issues, it does not directly correlate with criminal behavior in the provided examples\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could suggest limited social support, which might increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Employment Status (3 jobs held)\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is generally protective against recidivism as it provides structure and income\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use in Past 4 Years\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs reduces the likelihood of drug-related crimes\"),\n    (\"No Depression in Past Month\", \"low\", \"Good mental health can mitigate factors that may contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Urban Upbringing with Both Biological Parents\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area, despite potential exposure to crime, with both parents present might offer some protective factors against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Believes God Influences His Life\", \"low\", \"This belief could deter criminal behavior due to moral considerations, though its impact is less clear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
