    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 20-year-old female will recidivate within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at her criminal history: she has been arrested once and convicted. In the examples provided, people with multiple arrests (like 7 or 17 times) were more likely to recidivate. However, someone with just one arrest sometimes didn't reoffend. So I'd rate this as a medium risk because while it's low in count, a conviction does indicate potential for future issues.\n\nNext, education: she doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. In the examples, lack of education was often linked to higher recidivism. This seems like a strong indicator, so high weight here.\n\nEmployment status: she's held only one job during the year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor. People with no jobs were more likely to reoffend in the examples. But having some work history might mitigate this somewhat, so maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use was a significant factor in many examples leading to recidivism. This should be high because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\n\nResidential stability: she's living alone now, but she grew up in a large household of 7 in an urban area. The size and environment might have contributed to her background, so medium risk here as it's not current but could influence behavior.\n\nFamily dynamics: lived with her biological mother. In the examples, family situations varied, but having a stable figure might help, though she didn't complete education, which is more critical. So perhaps low impact compared to other factors.\n\nBelief in God: she considers God influential in her life. Some examples showed that such beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism, so this could be a low risk, but not the most significant.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are education and drug use. Employment status is also a moderate concern. Her age and being female might slightly reduce risk compared to males, but given her circumstances, there's still a notable chance she'll recidivate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest and Conviction History\", \"medium\", \"Has been arrested once and convicted, which is a moderate indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Does not have a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, indicating lower educational attainment which correlates with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Has held only one job during the year, suggesting limited stability and potential challenges in maintaining steady employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Uses marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, a strong indicator of potential recidivism as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Residential Stability\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone and grew up in an urban area with a household size of 7; while not directly indicative of high risk, it suggests possible challenges in community support or supervision\"),\n    (\"Family Dynamics\", \"low\", \"Lived with her biological mother, which may provide some level of support but is less impactful compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Considers God influential in her life; while this can be a protective factor, it's not the strongest indicator in this case.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
