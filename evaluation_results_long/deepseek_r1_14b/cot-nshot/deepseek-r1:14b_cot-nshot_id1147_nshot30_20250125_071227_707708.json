    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. I need to predict whether a 21-year-old Hispanic male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the provided information:\n\n- **Age**: 21 (young adult)\n- **Race/Ethnicity**: Hispanic\n- **Arrests/Convictions**: Arrested 3 times, convicted\n- **Height/Weight**: 5'8\", 185 lbs. (average build)\n- **Marital Status**: Never married, living alone\n- **Education**: No diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\n- **Employment**: Held 1 job during the year\n- **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years\n- **Mental Health**: Not depressed last month\n- **Family Background**: Lived in a household of size 6 as a child\n- **Religious Belief**: Considers God's role in his life\n\nNow, I'll go through each factor and assign a weight (low, medium, high) based on the examples provided.\n\n1. **Arrest History**: He has been arrested 3 times and convicted. Looking at the examples, higher arrest counts (like 7 or 17) often led to \"YES.\" So 3 arrests might be a medium risk here.\n   \n2. **Convictions**: Having convictions is serious. In the examples, even one conviction sometimes led to rearrest. This should probably be a high weight because it indicates past criminal behavior that could repeat.\n\n3. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education is linked with higher recidivism rates. From the examples, this seems like a medium factor since several cases had similar issues but weren't always predictive alone.\n\n4. **Employment**: He's held 1 job during the year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor, but one job might not be too concerning. Maybe low weight here as it's somewhat stable.\n\n5. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana recently. In examples, drug use was often a high or medium factor. Since he used in the past four years, this is likely a high weight because drugs can contribute to recidivism.\n\n6. **Family Background**: Lived in a household of 6 as a child. Larger family size might indicate more risk factors but not sure how strong. This seems like a low or medium factor, perhaps low since it's just one aspect.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: Not depressed recently, so this is actually positive. Probably a low weight as mental health issues can be a risk, but he doesn't have them currently.\n\n8. **Living Situation**: Living alone and never married. Solitary living might mean less support, which could increase recidivism risk. From examples, living alone was sometimes a medium factor, so I'll assign medium here.\n\n9. **Religious Belief**: Considers God's role. In some cases, this was associated with lower recidivism. It should be a low weight as it's protective but not the strongest factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors and their weights, let me tally them up:\n\n- High: Convictions (3), Drug Use (5)\n- Medium: Arrest History (2), Employment (4), Living Situation (8)\n- Low: Education Level (6), Family Background (7), Mental Health (9), Religious Belief (10)\n\nLooking at the examples, when there were multiple high factors like convictions and drug use, the prediction was often \"YES.\" His having both a conviction and recent drug use makes me lean towards \"YES.\"\n\nConfidence level: Given that two of his factors are high and others contribute moderately, I'm about 75% confident in predicting rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"3 arrests indicate moderate risk\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"Convictions strongly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is a risk factor\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Having one job shows some stability\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use increases risk\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Large household size, not a major risk\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less support\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Potential protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
