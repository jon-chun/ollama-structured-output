    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person will rearrest in the next three years based on the given risk factors. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he was arrested once and convicted. Looking at the examples, having any arrest seems significant but maybe not the highest weight since some people with arrests didn't recidivate. I'll give this a medium weight because it's a direct indicator but could be influenced by other factors.\n\nNext, his drug use\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. In many cases, drug use correlates with higher recidivism rates. Especially since he used multiple drugs, I think this is a high-weight factor. Drugs often lead to more crime to support habits or get supplies.\n\nHe's single and living alone. From the examples, people living alone sometimes have less support, which might increase risk. But it's not as strong as drug use, so medium weight here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is usually protective against recidivism. More education often means better opportunities and lower chances of reoffending. This should be a low-weight factor because while positive, other factors are more influential.\n\nHaving held two jobs this year suggests he's trying to stay employed, which is good. Employment reduces the likelihood of crime. So another low-weight factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area when young. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family dynamics can vary. This seems like a medium weight because growing up in a high-crime area could influence behavior, but it's not as direct as current factors.\n\nLastly, he believes God influences what happens to him. In some cases, strong religious beliefs can reduce recidivism by providing motivation to stay on the right path. So this is another low-weight factor but slightly more than others because belief systems can have a significant impact.\n\nNow, considering all these weights: drug use is high, arrest history and living situation are medium, while education, employment, family background, and religious beliefs are low. The strongest factors pointing towards rearrest are the drug use and prior conviction. Other factors like employment and education might mitigate but aren't enough to outweigh the negatives.\n\nLooking at past examples, people with multiple arrests or severe drug use often had higher recidivism. Since this person has used drugs extensively and was convicted once, it's likely he could reoffend. However, his current stable job and education might reduce that risk somewhat. Balancing these, I think the chance is moderate to high.\n\nI'll predict \"YES\" for rearrest with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (1 time)\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicate past criminal behavior but may not be as strong as multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially involving both marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Currently living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might reduce support systems that could help prevent reoffending, increasing the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and enrolled in 2-year college\", \"low\", \"Education generally reduces recidivism; enrollment suggests commitment to education which is protective.\"),\n    (\"Held two jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Employment can be a protective factor against recidivism, indicating stability and purpose.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in an urban area as a child\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and family dynamics might contribute to higher crime exposure but are less direct than current factors.\"),\n    (\"Believes God influences events\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
