    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 22-year-old Black female will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me list all the provided information:\n\n- **Age**: 22 years old. Since she's young and has a history of arrests, her age might still contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n  \n- **Race**: Black. From the examples given, I notice that race alone doesn't seem to be a determining factor, but it's often correlated with systemic issues.\n\n- **Arrests/Convictions**: She's been arrested 4 times and convicted. In the examples, people with multiple arrests (like 7 or 3) had outcomes of YES, so her 4 might lean towards higher risk.\n\n- **Education**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits employment opportunities.\n\n- **Employment**: She hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant indicator; without stable work, the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior increases.\n\n- **Drug Use**: She used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is often linked to recidivism, especially if it leads to seeking money through illegal means or associations with drug networks.\n\n- **Living Situation**: Currently living alone. In some cases, having support systems can reduce recidivism, but living alone might mean less accountability and more isolation.\n\n- **Family History**: Lived with her biological mother in a household of 6 in an urban area. Larger families and urban settings can sometimes contribute to higher exposure to negative influences, though this varies widely.\n\n- **Beliefs**: Considers that God has something to do with what happens to her. While spirituality can be a positive factor, it's unclear how strong her belief is or if it deters criminal behavior.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided:\n\nIn Examples 1 through 30, several factors seem to influence the outcome. For instance, in Example 29, an 18-year-old female with multiple arrests (17), drug use, lack of education, unemployment, and living in a household of size 4 resulted in NO. Conversely, someone with fewer arrests but other high-risk factors might still have a higher likelihood.\n\nLet me assign weights to each factor:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: High weight because multiple arrests are strong indicators.\n2. **Convictions**: Medium, as they contribute but aren't the sole factor.\n3. **Education Level**: High, since lack of education correlates with recidivism.\n4. **Employment Status**: High, as unemployment is a major risk.\n5. **Drug Use**: Medium to high, depending on severity and frequency.\n6. **Living Situation**: Low, unless there's specific instability.\n7. **Family History**: Low, but urban setting might add some weight.\n8. **Beliefs/Spirituality**: Low, possibly positive influence.\n\nConsidering all factors, her 4 arrests are significant, as in Examples 1-30, higher arrest numbers (like 3, 7, etc.) often resulted in YES. Her lack of education and employment are also strong negatives. However, she doesn't show signs of depression or other mental health issues, which could have been a mitigating factor.\n\nI think the factors pointing towards recidivism are stronger here. She has multiple arrests, no job, no education, drug use\u2014these all stack up. However, her belief in God might provide some resistance. But given the weight of the negative factors, I would lean towards predicting YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"4 arrests indicate a pattern increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Convictions suggest legal involvement affecting future behavior\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits opportunities, increasing recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year indicates potential instability and higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use may contribute to criminal behavior and recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may affect support systems but not a major factor here\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"low\", \"Urban household size might expose her to influences, but not the strongest factor\"),\n    (\"Beliefs/Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Potential positive influence but uncertain impact on recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
