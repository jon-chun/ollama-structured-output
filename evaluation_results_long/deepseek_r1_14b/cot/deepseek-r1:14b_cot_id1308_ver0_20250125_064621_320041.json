    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male. Age is a significant factor because younger offenders are often at higher risk due to lack of stability and maturity. So that's medium.\n\nHe identifies as Black. While race isn't a direct indicator, systemic factors might influence risk. I'll consider this low impact here but note it for context.\n\nArrested twice with convictions. Previous arrests and convictions are strong indicators; this should be high because prior offenses correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly affect risk, so that's low.\n\nNever married and living alone might mean less support system, which is a medium factor since social supports can reduce recidivism.\n\nNo diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is linked to employment opportunities and lower recidivism, so high here because lack of education could hinder his prospects.\n\nUnemployed for the past year\u2014employment provides structure and income, reducing the incentive to commit crimes. Unemployment is a strong indicator, so medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014this is positive and low risk. However, recent depressed feelings might indicate mental health issues which can contribute to recidivism if untreated, so medium there.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with five siblings could mean exposure to higher crime environments, making it a high factor.\n\nLived with biological mother; family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more info, I'll consider this low impact.\n\nBelieves God influences his life\u2014religion often acts as a protective factor against crime, so this is a medium positive factor.\n\nConsidering all factors, the positives are education and employment gaps, mental health, religion. But the negatives like prior arrests, lack of education, unemployment, urban upbringing, and family size outweigh them. The strongest negative factors are prior convictions (high), lack of education (high), and unemployment (medium). These contribute more to recidivism than positive aspects.\n\nSo overall, the risk is high enough to predict rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; younger offenders are at higher risk\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Identifies as Black; systemic factors may influence but not direct\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrested twice with convictions; strong indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'9\\\" and 145 lbs; no direct correlation to risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married; lack of spousal support may increase risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone; less social support can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED, not enrolled in college; education is linked to lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployed for the past year; unemployment correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years; positive indicator but recent depression noted\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recently felt down; mental health issues can contribute to recidivism if untreated\"),\n    (\"family_of_origin\", \"high\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area; potentially higher exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has influence; religion may act as a protective factor but not certain\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
