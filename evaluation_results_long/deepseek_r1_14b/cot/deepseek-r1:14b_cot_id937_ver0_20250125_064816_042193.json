    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 19. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet. But since she's married and living with her spouse, that could be a mitigating factor.\n\nGender is female. I remember that in general, women tend to have lower recidivism rates than men, so this should probably be a low weight.\n\nRace is White, which might have some implications based on systemic factors, but without more context, it's hard to assign a high risk here.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: two times arrested and convicted. That\u2019s significant because multiple arrests can indicate a pattern, so I\u2019d rate that as medium.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education is often linked with higher recidivism, but she has some stability living with her spouse, so maybe it's medium here too.\n\nEmployment history: She held one job during the year. Steady employment can be a protective factor, but since she only had one, I might lean towards low for this factor.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so that should probably be high.\n\nMental health: She felt down in the dumps most of the month. Depression can increase risk if not managed, but without more info, maybe medium.\n\nFamily background: Lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 in rural area. Not sure about family dynamics, so low.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God's role in her life. Some studies suggest positive religious involvement can reduce recidivism, so that should be low.\n\nNow, putting it all together. Most factors are low or medium except drug use and prior convictions. Since substance abuse is a strong factor and she has two convictions, the risk might lean towards YES for recidivism with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old may indicate higher risk due to youth but mitigated by marriage\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race typically not a strong predictor without other factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and convictions suggest potential pattern\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED may indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held one job shows some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_4_years\", \"high\", \"Marijuana and cocaine use are strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate emotional distress contributing to risk\"),\n    (\"family_background_household_size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a household of 4, rural area not strongly indicative\"),\n    (\"religious_belief_significance\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may have mitigating effects\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
