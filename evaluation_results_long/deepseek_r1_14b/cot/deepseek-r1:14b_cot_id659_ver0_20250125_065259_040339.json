    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this individual. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might still be unstable in their lives. But since she's female, that might actually lower her risk compared to males, as gender can play a role. So I'm thinking age is medium.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic factors, but it's not the most significant factor here. Maybe low impact.\n\nArrest history: 9 arrests and convicted. That's a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk. Definitely high weight here because multiple arrests and convictions are red flags.\n\nEducational background: She has a high school diploma, which is good, but she's not in college. While education can help, the lack of further education might still be a moderate factor. Maybe medium.\n\nEmployment: She held one job during the year. Having stable employment is usually protective, but since it's just one and recent, it's probably low to medium.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana use in past four years. Substance use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. High weight here because drug involvement often leads to continued criminal behavior.\n\nMental health: No depression symptoms recently, which is positive. So this should be low since mental health issues can increase risk if present.\n\nFamily background: Lived with her biological mother in an urban area with 5 people. Large family size and urban setting might indicate higher exposure to negative influences. Medium weight here because it's not too severe but still a factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: Doesn't feel God is involved in her life. Lack of strong social support from religion can be a risk, so medium.\n\nPutting all these together, the strongest factors are arrest history and drug use. Positive aspects like employment and education help mitigate some risks, but overall, it seems she has more high-risk factors pointing towards possible recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is a young adult, which can indicate higher risk due to instability but lower compared to younger ages\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have varying systemic factors but not the primary determinant here\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"9 arrests and convictions strongly correlate with high recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma shows basic education, but lack of college enrollment is a moderate concern\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held 1 job recently indicates some stability, though not extensive\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with 5 siblings may indicate higher exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's role suggests lower social support from religion\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
