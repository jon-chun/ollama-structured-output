    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. That's young, so it's considered low risk because younger people might still be in a transitional phase and could change their behavior.\n\nHe identifies as White, but race alone isn't a significant predictor, so that's low.\n\nArrested twice with convictions. Previous convictions are a strong indicator of future offenses, so medium here.\n\nNo mention of gang involvement or associates, which is good\u2014so low risk there.\n\nHeight and weight don\u2019t predict recidivism on their own; low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Marital status can be a factor, but being single isn't necessarily bad. Living alone might reduce support systems, so medium? Or maybe low if he's managing okay.\n\nHigh school diploma and in college\u2014education is protective against crime, so that's high risk reducing.\n\nEmployed for a year\u2014steady employment is a good sign, so high.\n\nDrug use in past four years with marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use correlates with higher recidivism, so medium to high. Let's go with high here because it's recent and can lead to further legal issues.\n\nNo depression reported recently\u2014mental health stability is positive, low risk.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of 5. Urban areas have higher crime rates, but having stable parental figures might mitigate that. So maybe medium for the urban factor, but family support could lower it. Let's consider this as low since he has parents involved despite the environment.\n\nBelieves God influences his life\u2014spirituality is often protective, so high positive impact, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: factors like previous convictions and drug use are significant, while education and employment are strong positives. The prediction leans towards recidivism because of past behavior and substance issues, but not overwhelmingly. Confidence might be around 60% considering the mixed factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is relatively young and may still be in a transitional phase\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White race is not a significant predictor of recidivism on its own\"),\n    (\"number_of_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two convictions indicate a history of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"gang_association\", \"low\", \"No information provided about gang involvement\"),\n    (\"physical_measurement_height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married status is not strongly predictive of recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate weaker social support networks, which could increase risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Enrollment in a 4-year college suggests higher educational attainment and lower risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Having held one job during the year indicates stable employment, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use_in_past_4_years\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of potential future criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health_recent_depression\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month suggests good mental health\"),\n    (\"family_background_parents_alive\", \"low\", \"Having both biological parents alive may provide some stability, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"upbringing_community_type\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing can be a risk factor due to higher crime rates, but it is mitigated by family presence\"),\n    (\"spirituality_religiosity_importance\", \"high\", \"Religious belief may serve as a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
