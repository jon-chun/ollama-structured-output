    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. That's young but not extremely so. Some risk assessments consider younger offenders as higher risk because they might be less settled, but at 21, it's a bit more nuanced. I'll tentatively assign low to this unless other factors complicate things.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. Ethnicity can sometimes be a factor in recidivism rates, though it's complex and often tied to systemic issues rather than inherent characteristics. I might lean towards low here but acknowledge that this is a sensitive area.\n\nArrested 4 times with convictions. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions usually indicate higher risk because they show a pattern of criminal behavior that hasn't been deterred by previous punishments. This should be high weight.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so I'll skip those unless there's something else to consider, like gang involvement tied to size, but nothing indicates that here.\n\nSeparated and living alone. Marital status can affect recidivism\u2014being separated might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor. Living alone might reduce supervision and increase isolation, possibly leading to higher risk. Medium weight here.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level is important; higher education can be protective against crime. Not being enrolled might indicate disengagement from formal systems, so medium weight for this.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it reduces opportunities and increases stress. High weight here.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014positive indicator, lowers risk. So low weight.\n\nNo depression in past month\u2014mental health issues can contribute to crime if untreated. Since he's not depressed now, but past issues might still matter. Maybe medium? Or perhaps low because current state is positive.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of 6 in an urban area. Family structure and environment are significant. Growing up in a large family in the city could mean more exposure to crime or less parental supervision, so high weight here.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal events\u2014this might relate to lack of social support or religious influence, which can be protective factors. So this is medium.\n\nPutting it all together: High factors are arrest/convictions and past living environment. Medium include marital status, education, mental health, and spirituality. Low are age, Hispanic identity, employment, drug use.\n\nThe presence of multiple high-weight factors like arrests and family background likely increases the risk. However, positive factors like no drug use might temper it a bit. But given the arrest history and unemployment, I think recidivism is probable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"low\", \"A 21-year-old is relatively young but not extremely so; some risk factors may apply, but age alone isn't a strong predictor without other variables.\"),\n    (\"hispanic_identity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity can be a factor in recidivism rates, though it's often tied to systemic issues rather than inherent characteristics.\"),\n    (\"multiple_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrested 4 times with convictions indicates a pattern of criminal behavior and lack of deterrence from past penalties, significantly increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"separated_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Separated status may reduce social support, while living alone could decrease supervision and increase isolation, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma_not_enrolled_college\", \"medium\", \"While having a high school diploma is positive, not being enrolled in college might indicate disengagement from formal education systems, potentially increasing risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unemployed_year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism as it reduces opportunities and increases stress, making it harder to stay\u9075\u7eaa\u5b88\u6cd5 without engaging in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_past_four_years\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive indicator, suggesting lower likelihood of substance-related crimes and thus reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"not_depressed_past_month\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed recently may indicate current mental stability, but past mental health issues could still influence behavior.
