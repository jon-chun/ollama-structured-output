    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age is a factor because younger individuals might be more impulsive or have less life experience, but since he's 18 and not much older than that, I'd say it's a medium risk here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, so this is probably a high factor because an arrest without conviction still shows some level of behavior that could lead to recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to crime, so I'd rate that as low.\n\nHe's never married, which isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own. But living alone might be a consideration\u2014people who live alone sometimes have less social support, which can contribute to higher risk. So this could be medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is usually protective against crime, so having a diploma is good, but not being in college might mean he's not engaged in further education or hasn't found stable employment yet. That leans towards low because it's neutral, but perhaps more context would be needed.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism because it provides structure and income. So this is a positive factor\u2014low risk here.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, though it's not as strong as harder drugs. Still, it's a moderate concern, so medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, but since he's not reporting depression now, that's low.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with his biological mother might indicate some family dynamics. Larger families could mean less supervision or more challenges, which is a medium risk factor.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Spirituality can sometimes be protective, providing a sense of purpose and reducing recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNow, aggregating these factors: high factors are arrest history; mediums include age, living alone, drug use, and family background; lows are employment, education, mental health, and spirituality. Since he has one high factor and several medium ones, the overall risk is moderate but leans towards higher given the arrest and other contributing factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_18\", \"medium\", \"Age can be a factor as individuals may have less life experience and could be more impulsive\"),\n    (\"arrested_once\", \"high\", \"An arrest without conviction indicates potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"weight_and_height\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between weight/height and recidivism\"),\n    (\"never_married\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma\", \"low\", \"Education can be protective but not actively enrolled in further education\"),\n    (\"held_one_job\", \"low\", \"Employment is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"marijuana_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use may correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"not_depressed\", \"low\", \"No current mental health issues reported\"),\n    (\"family_of_4\", \"medium\", \"Larger family size may indicate less supervision or more challenges\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Spirituality can be protective and reduce recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
