    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 18-year-old Black female over the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Juvenile records might not be as extensive, but she's young and still developing, which could mean lower risk if it's her first offense.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a point in her favor because no conviction means less official record of criminal behavior.\n\nHer gender is female. I recall that generally, men have higher recidivism rates than women, so being female might be a protective factor here.\n\nRace is Black. There's some debate about how race affects recidivism. It could play a role in systemic issues like policing and sentencing, but it's a sensitive factor. I'll consider it as low impact here unless other factors indicate otherwise.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism risk, so I can probably ignore those.\n\nShe lives alone, hasn't been married, which might mean she has less social support, potentially increasing her risk slightly, but this is a minor factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is linked to lower recidivism; higher education provides better opportunities and reduces the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior. So this could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator for potential recidivism because it correlates with financial strain and lack of structure, which can push someone towards illegal activities. That's probably a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism. It affects decision-making and can lead to further criminal behavior to sustain drug habits. Definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe's been feeling down recently, nothing cheering her up. Depression or low mood can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. That adds another moderate risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of 8 people could indicate a lack of structure or supervision, which might have contributed to her current situation. Urban area living might also expose her to more crime influences. So that's a low to medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal events. Spiritual beliefs can be protective, providing coping mechanisms and support systems, so this is a slight protective factor but probably not significant enough to offset others.\n\nPutting it all together: the strongest factors are unemployment (high) and drug use (high). Education level is moderate, along with mood issues. The other factors are low impact. Considering her first arrest without conviction and being female might help mitigate some risk. I think the high negative factors outweigh the positives, so she's at a higher risk of recidivism.\n\nFor confidence, it's not extremely high but considering two high risks and several moderate ones, maybe around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_18\", \"low\", \"Youth often correlates with lower recidivism rates if it is the first offense.\"),\n    (\"not_convicted\", \"low\", \"No conviction indicates less formal criminal record\"),\n    (\"female_gender\", \"low\", \"Generally lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"black_race\", \"low\", \"Race may influence systemic factors but not directly predictive here\"),\n    (\"lives_alone unmarried\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support may increase risk\"),\n    (\"no_highschool Ged_not_enrolled\", \"medium\", \"Education linked to lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"unemployed_last_year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past4yrs\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"depressed_mood\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase risk\"),\n    (\"large_household_urban\", \"low\", \"Potentially indicates lack of structure but not significant here\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"May provide protective factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
