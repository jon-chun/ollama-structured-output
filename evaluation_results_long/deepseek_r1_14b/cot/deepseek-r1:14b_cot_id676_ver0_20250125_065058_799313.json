    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this individual reoffending within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might still be establishing themselves socially and economically. Plus, being in their early twenties can mean more impulsive behavior.\n\nHe's male, which generally correlates with higher recidivism rates compared to females. Men make up the majority of offenders, so that's another point towards higher risk.\n\nRace is White. While race isn't a direct factor, there might be underlying socioeconomic factors associated with certain groups that could influence recidivism.\n\nArrested 22 times and convicted. That's a high number of arrests, which strongly suggests a pattern of criminal behavior. Convictions indicate successful prosecutions, making it more likely he has a well-established history of crime.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, but in some cases, physical presence might influence gang involvement or access to resources, though I'm not sure about that here. Probably low impact.\n\nNever married and living alone. Being unmarried can mean less responsibility, potentially leading to higher risk. Living alone might reduce accountability since there's no family support system, which could be a medium factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Low education levels are often linked with higher recidivism because education is a protective factor against crime. This seems like a strong indicator, so I'll rate it high.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but holding only one job might indicate limited opportunities or possible underemployment, which could still leave him at risk if that job isn't stable.\n\nUsed drugs in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant factor because it often accompanies criminal behavior, especially for substances like cocaine which are more associated with high-crime activities. This should be a high-weighted factor.\n\nFeels down most of the time recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk as stress and depression might lead to coping mechanisms that involve crime. So, medium here because it's recent but not severe yet.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Urban areas have higher crime rates, so that's a contributing factor. Family dynamics could influence behavior, especially if there are few support systems.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life events. Lack of spiritual or religious involvement can be a risk factor as religion often provides guidance and support that might deter criminal behavior. This is probably low impact but still notable.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple high factors like number of arrests, drug use, education level; medium factors like age, living alone, mental health; and some lower ones like race, job status, religious beliefs. The cumulative effect points towards a high risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"21 years old is a high-risk age group for recidivism as individuals in their early twenties are more likely to engage in criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates compared to females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor, but socioeconomic factors may play a role\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"22 arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Convictions show successful prosecutions and a history of crime\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Having only one job may indicate limited opportunities or instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially cocaine, correlates with higher criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate stressors contributing to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and unmarried may reduce accountability and support systems\"),\n    (\"urban_living\", \"high\", \"Urban areas have higher crime rates, increasing recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement might contribute but is a weaker factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
