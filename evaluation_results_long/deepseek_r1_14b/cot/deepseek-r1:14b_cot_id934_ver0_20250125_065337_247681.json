    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for a 20-year-old Black male over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Young adults are often at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet, but since he's just out of custody, his age could be a medium risk here.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I know that race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, so maybe that's a high factor because of potential biases or community factors.\n\nArrested once and convicted. A single conviction isn't super high, but it does indicate some criminal behavior, so I'd say medium for this.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so low here.\n\nNever married, living alone. Lack of family support can be a risk factor, especially since he's young and might not have strong community ties. That could be medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is a protective factor; higher education usually lowers recidivism, so this should be low.\n\nEmployed once during the year. Having a job is good but it was only one instance. Economic stability can help, so maybe low here.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not depressed recently. Substance abuse is a big risk, so absence of that is definitely a protective factor\u2014low.\n\nLived in a household of size 3 when young. Larger families might have more challenges but could also offer support. Not sure about this one; it's tricky, maybe low.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Spirituality can be a protective factor, so that's low risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the main factors are race and past conviction as medium or high. But most others are low. So overall, I'm leaning towards he might recidivate but not highly likely. Confidence is around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_20\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are often at higher risk for recidivism as they may still be in transitional life stages, and this individual recently exited custody.\"),\n    (\"race_Black\", \"high\", \"Race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues and potential biases affecting recidivism rates, though it's not a direct indicator of behavior\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction_arrest_1\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates past criminal behavior but may not strongly predict future offenses without additional factors.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly correlate with recidivism risk in standard assessments.\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital ties and living alone can be a risk factor, particularly for young individuals without strong support systems\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma_not_in_college\", \"low\", \"Education level can influence recidivism; higher education is generally protective but this individual's current educational status is neutral in this context.\"),\n    (\"employed_once_past_year\", \"low\", \"Employment history is a stabilizing factor, though one instance may not be sufficient to significantly reduce risk\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_past_4_years\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs reduces a significant recidivism risk factor\"),\n    (\"household_size_3_young\", \"low\", \"Family dynamics can influence behavior but without additional context, this is a neutral factor\"),\n    (\"religion_importance\", \"low\", \"Spirituality may serve as a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
