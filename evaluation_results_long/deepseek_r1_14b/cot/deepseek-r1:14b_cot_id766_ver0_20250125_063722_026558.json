    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for a 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22, which is relatively young. Young offenders have higher rates of recidivism, but she's an adult now, so that might balance out. I'll note this as a medium factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can be a factor in some studies, but it's often more about systemic issues rather than individual risk. I'm not sure if this should be high or low, maybe low since it's more about societal factors than personal risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction is concerning but not extremely so. It shows she's had run-ins with the law, which could indicate higher risk. Medium here.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism risk unless there are specific circumstances, so probably low impact.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marital status can be protective, suggesting lower risk because of support systems. That leans towards a low factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is important; higher education generally correlates with lower recidivism. However, she did complete high school, so maybe medium since it's not the highest level but shows some achievement.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Employment is protective against recidivism. Having two jobs indicates stability and responsibility, so this should be a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is significant. Marijuana use can be linked to criminal behavior, especially if it's recent. This might be medium or high. Since it's within the last four years and she was convicted once, I'll go with medium.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so no depression is a positive sign, making this low.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. Family environment can influence behavior, but without more info on dysfunction, it's probably low impact.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life. Spiritual beliefs might provide support and reduce recidivism risk, so that should be low.\n\nConsidering all factors: one medium from the arrest/conviction, two mediums (drug use and education), several lows, and none high. The positive factors like employment, marital status, education, and spirituality may outweigh the negatives. However, her past conviction is a notable concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; young adults have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White; no strong correlation with race and risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction history\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Married and living with spouse; supportive environment\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs during the year; stable employment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression symptoms in past month\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in rural area\"),\n    (\"spirituality_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in her life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
