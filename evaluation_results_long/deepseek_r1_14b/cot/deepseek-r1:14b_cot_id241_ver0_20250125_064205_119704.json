    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this individual over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not a minor anymore. Juvenile records might be sealed, but she's still at an age where peer influences and impulsive behavior could play a role. I'll rate this as low because it's more about potential than actual past behavior.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes be a factor in recidivism rates, but it's complex and influenced by many other variables like systemic issues. Without more context, I'd say this is low risk.\n\nArrest history: She's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions can affect future employment or housing but don't necessarily indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. However, an arrest might still be a red flag. Medium seems appropriate here because it shows some potential for misconduct but no proven guilt.\n\nGED education instead of high school diploma\u2014some studies suggest that lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism. But she's working and has a GED, which could indicate she's trying to stay on track. I'll go with medium for this factor.\n\nShe's living alone now, which might mean she doesn't have strong support systems in place. Living situation can influence behavior and access to negative influences. This is probably low to medium risk depending on other factors.\n\nEmployment history: She held one job during the year. Stable employment is a positive sign linked to lower recidivism. So this should be low risk because having a job can deter criminal activity.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism. Even though she hasn't been convicted, drug use itself can lead to more arrests and is a major red flag. This should be high risk because drugs often play a big role in repeat offenses.\n\nMental health: She's felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible depression or other mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase recidivism rates as individuals might struggle with coping mechanisms and accessing treatment. This is medium risk because it's concerning but not necessarily severe without more info.\n\nFamily background: Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas may have higher crime rates. It's a mixed bag, so I'll rate this as low to medium. Maybe leaning towards low since she had stable family upbringing.\n\nReligious belief: She believes God is involved in her life. Studies show that strong religious beliefs can reduce recidivism by providing support and purpose. So this should be low risk because it's a protective factor.\n\nPutting all together, most factors are low except drug use (high) and possibly mental health (medium). The arrest history is also medium. Considering the positive factors like employment and religion, but the significant high risk from drug use, I think she might be at risk for rearrest. So prediction is YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old; not a minor but young age may indicate potential for impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White; race can be a factor, but context is needed\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrested once without conviction; indicates some risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED education instead of high school diploma\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone; may affect support systems\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held one job during the year; stable employment is positive\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in past four years; significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feeling down recently; potential mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents in an urban household\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in her life; protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
