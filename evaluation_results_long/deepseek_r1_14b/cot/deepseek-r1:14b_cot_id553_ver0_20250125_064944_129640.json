    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19. From what I know, younger offenders are often at higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet and could be more impulsive. So that should probably be a high risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as Black. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues in the justice system, but it's also a sensitive area. However, in some studies, being from a minority group can be an indicator, so I'd consider this medium.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A criminal history is definitely significant. Having a conviction usually increases the risk of rearrest, so that should be high.\n\nHeight and weight at 5'0\" and 110 lbs\u2014these stats alone don't directly impact recidivism unless they relate to other factors like employment or social interactions. Maybe medium for this one since it's not directly related but could affect self-esteem or opportunities.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support, which could be a risk factor. Marital status isn't as strong on its own, so I'd say low to medium here. Let's go with medium because living alone can reduce support networks.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big one. Lower education levels are often linked to higher recidivism rates. So this should be high risk.\n\nShe has held 1 job during the year. Employment is protective, but having only one job might indicate instability or part-time work. It's better than unemployment, so I'll rate it as low since she does have some employment history.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014positive indicator. So this should be a low risk factor because substance abuse is often tied to crime.\n\nShe felt down recently but hasn't necessarily shown other signs of severe depression. Mental health can influence behavior, so even if it's mild, it's still relevant. Medium for this one.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 6. Large family size might indicate challenges with supervision or social dynamics. This could be a medium risk factor as it relates to early environment influences.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life. Religious involvement is generally protective against crime, so this should be low because it's a positive indicator.\n\nPutting all these together: high factors like age, criminal history, education; mediums include race, living alone, family size, and mental health; lows are marital status, employment, drug use, and religion. The majority of the higher risks point towards a likely recidivism. I'm estimating confidence at around 65% because while there are several high factors, some protective elements like employment and religious belief might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"high\", \"Young age can be associated with higher recidivism rates due to immaturity and lack of stability\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"medium\", \"Race can correlate with systemic issues but is a sensitive factor in recidivism assessment\"),\n    (\"criminal_conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the risk of rearrest\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"medium\", \"While not directly indicative, height and weight may affect self-esteem or opportunities\"),\n    (\"living_alone unmarried\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse can reduce support networks\"),\n    (\"no_highschool Ged_not_enrolled\", \"high\", \"Low education levels are linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"held_one_job\", \"low\", \"Employment is protective; having held one job is positive but limited\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_last4years\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"feeling_down Recently\", \"medium\", \"Mental health struggles can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"household_size_6\", \"medium\", \"Large family size may indicate challenges in upbringing\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement is generally protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
