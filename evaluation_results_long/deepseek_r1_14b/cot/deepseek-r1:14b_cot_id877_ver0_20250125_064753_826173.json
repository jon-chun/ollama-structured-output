    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old male over the next three years. Let's break down each piece of information provided.\n\nFirst, he was arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can be indicative of potential future issues, but without a conviction, it might suggest that charges were dropped or he was acquitted, which could lower the risk slightly. However, arrests themselves are still relevant as they indicate past behavior that could recur.\n\nHe's white, 6'0\", and weighs 155 lbs. His race might not be directly indicative of risk, but in some contexts, it could relate to systemic issues or stereotypes, though I think in this case, it's more neutral. His build is average, so probably no significant factors there.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but he's only 22, so maybe still has family nearby. No marriage could indicate focus on education or career, which is positive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is generally protective against recidivism. Being in a 4-year program suggests he's engaged and has goals beyond immediate issues.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be a strong negative factor as it shows stability and responsibility. However, having only one job might mean he hasn't had long-term employment yet, but it's still better than no employment history.\n\nNo drug use in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so his clean record here is positive. Lack of depression also suggests lower mental health issues that could contribute to crime.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a household of four. Stable upbringing can reduce risk factors, but larger families might have different dynamics. However, having two parents present is generally protective.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal events. This indicates low religious involvement, which sometimes correlates with higher risk since religion can be a deterrent. But it's not the only factor.\n\nNow, considering all these, the main positive factors are education, employment, no drug use, and stable upbringing. The arrest is a concern but without conviction. His age and living situation are neutral to slightly positive.\n\nI think most factors lean towards low risk, so I would predict \"NO\" rearrest. Confidence might be around 70% because while there's an arrest, the other factors mitigate that risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is within a high-risk age range for recidivism but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"singlethood\", \"medium\", \"Being single can correlate with higher risk due to potential lack of support systems\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in college suggests strong academic focus and lower risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Having held 1 job indicates stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years significantly lowers risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently reduces risk factors\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up with both parents but household size of 4 may have challenges\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence might slightly increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
