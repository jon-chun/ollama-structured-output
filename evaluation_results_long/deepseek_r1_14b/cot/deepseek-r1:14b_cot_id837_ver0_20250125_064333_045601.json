    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not too young. Youth can be a factor because individuals at this age might still be impulsive or influenced easily. However, it's also an age where they might start to stabilize, so I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nNext, being White doesn't carry any inherent bias in risk assessment models, unless there are systemic issues, which I should consider but not assign a weight here. So, no weight for race.\n\nHe's 6'3\" and weighs between 175-199 lbs. His build might influence interactions with law enforcement or perceptions, but without specific behaviors linked to it, I'd say low risk.\n\nSingle marital status is neutral; being married can sometimes reduce recidivism, but since he's single, it doesn't add risk here. Low.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests potential barriers to employment and social services. This could be a medium risk because education is linked to better outcomes and lower recidivism.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so this is a positive factor. Low risk.\n\nConvicted once at 18\u2014first offense might mean lower risk than repeat offenders. Medium risk here because it's a conviction but early in life.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana) indicates substance abuse, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Medium.\n\nHe feels down most of the time and nothing cheers him up. Depression or low mood can impair decision-making and increase stress, leading to higher recidivism chance. High risk here because mental health is significant.\n\nLiving with biological mother in a household of 5 in rural area\u2014family dynamics can be complex, but no clear indicators of high risk unless there's dysfunction, which isn't specified. So, low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life might provide coping mechanisms or support, reducing recidivism. Low risk.\n\nNow, considering all factors: one medium conviction, two mediums for drug use and education, one high for mood issues. Others are low. The overall trend suggests moderate risk but the mental health issue is significant. So, I'd predict a 'YES' for recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old; age is not highly indicative of recidivism risk but may suggest potential instability\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"One conviction at a young age suggests moderate risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of diploma or GED and no college enrollment indicates potential barriers to employment and social integration\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held one job in the past year suggests some stability but limited history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of depression over the past month is a strong indicator of potential instability and higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a rural household size of 5 does not inherently indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide coping mechanisms but does not directly correlate to recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
