    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. Age is quite young, which might be a consideration in some contexts, but race shouldn't inherently contribute to risk assessment without specific related factors.\n\nShe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests can be a sign of potential future issues, especially if they're recent or multiple. However, no convictions mean she hasn't been proven guilty in court, which is a positive aspect.\n\nHer physical stats are 5'6\" and 162 lbs. I'm not sure how weight plays into risk assessment beyond health factors unless there's a specific criterion related to it, but it might not be directly relevant here.\n\nShe's never married and isn't living alone. Not being the head of a household or having dependents could mean less responsibility, which might sometimes correlate with higher risk in certain assessments, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can be linked to various social issues and potentially higher recidivism rates. This is a point that might increase the risk score.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. While having multiple jobs might indicate instability or a transient lifestyle, it could also show adaptability and work ethic. The context here isn't clear enough to definitively say it's a risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant concern. Substance abuse is often linked with higher criminal behavior and recidivism, which definitely increases risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health can be a factor, but the absence of depression might mitigate some risk associated with mental issues, though other factors could still contribute.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of size 3. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more social challenges, which might influence behavior but isn't a direct indicator.\n\nShe believes God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This might indicate a lack of strong support systems or coping mechanisms, potentially increasing risk if she doesn't have other resources.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple arrests without convictions could be concerning. Drug use is a major red flag for potential future issues. Lack of education and unstable employment might contribute to higher risk factors. However, no convictions and not feeling depressed are positive points. The belief about God might suggest limited support networks.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because the drug use and multiple arrests are significant, even without convictions. Education level and employment instability also add to that. But I'm not entirely certain; it's a bit on the edge.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
