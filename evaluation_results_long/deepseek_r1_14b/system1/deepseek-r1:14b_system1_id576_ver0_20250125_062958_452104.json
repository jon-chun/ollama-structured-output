    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each one and see what they might mean.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female, White. Age isn't directly an indicator of risk, but being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk if other factors are present.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a criminal history, which is definitely a red flag for high risk. Convictions often mean higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHeight and weight\u20145'2\" and 185 lbs. I don't think physical stats directly relate to risk, unless it's about health issues, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marital status can sometimes be a protective factor because of support systems, but it depends on the relationship's stability. Not sure how much this impacts risk assessment.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can correlate with higher risk factors like unemployment or other social issues, which might increase criminal behavior.\n\nShe's held 4 jobs in a year. That suggests she's had some instability\u2014maybe difficulty keeping employment, which could be a sign of underlying issues affecting her ability to maintain steady work.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is definitely a risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if it's recent. Cocaine is more concerning than marijuana in terms of potential for crime.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health is important; absence of depression here might lower some risks, but she has a history of drug use which could still be problematic.\n\nLived with non-biological parents in an urban household of size 4 at a young age. This indicates possible instability or lack of support during formative years, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nBelieves God influences her personal events. Religious beliefs are generally protective factors; they can reduce recidivism and promote positive behavior. But this might not completely offset other high-risk factors.\n\nSo putting it all together: She has a criminal conviction, recent drug use, limited education, job instability, and grew up in an unstable home environment. Despite her being married and having religious beliefs, the negative factors seem to outweigh the positives. Therefore, she's likely high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
