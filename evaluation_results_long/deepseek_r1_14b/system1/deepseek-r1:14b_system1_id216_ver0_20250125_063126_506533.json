    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's 22 years old and identifies as Black. Age is relevant because younger individuals might be more impulsive, but being in her early twenties could mean she has some life experience. Her race might not directly indicate risk unless there are systemic issues to consider, which I'm not sure about here.\n\nShe's been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions usually correlate with higher recidivism rates. People who have been through the system multiple times often have a pattern of criminal behavior, so this is a major high-risk indicator.\n\nCurrently, she's 5'5\" and weighs 221 lbs. I don't know if weight directly affects risk assessment unless it relates to health issues or other factors, but maybe not relevant here.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean fewer social supports, which could be a risk factor as she might lack help in times of need. Never being married might indicate instability in relationships, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lower education levels often link to higher crime rates because limited education can limit job opportunities, leading to poverty and potential criminal activity. Not being enrolled suggests she's not working on improving her situation, another red flag.\n\nShe hasn't held a job during the year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without stable employment, it's harder to reintegrate into society lawfully, increasing the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities for income.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially recent use, can indicate ongoing substance abuse issues, which often co-occur with criminal behavior. Depression might be a mitigating factor if present, but she's not currently feeling that way.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of six. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more social challenges. Large family size might indicate potential support but could also mean crowded living conditions contributing to behavioral issues.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal events. This is about spirituality, which can be both positive (offering support) or negative (if beliefs lead to justification of actions). I'm not sure how significant this factor is in risk assessment.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators. Unemployment, lack of education, living alone, and recent drug use add up to high risk factors. Her background in a large urban household might contribute but isn't as strong as her criminal history and current circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
