    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 18, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless combined with other issues. Gender as female might influence risk differently than male, but I'm not sure how in this context. Race is Black; I know that sometimes socioeconomic factors can play a role here, but it's important to consider without bias.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests are significant because they indicate prior law involvement, even if she was only convicted once. The fact that she's had multiple arrests might be a strong indicator of potential future issues.\n\nHer education level is low; no diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment often correlates with higher risk factors, possibly leading to fewer opportunities and increased likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe lives alone, which can be a concern because lack of support systems might make it harder for her to stay on the right path. Also, being unmarried at 18 isn't necessarily bad, but combined with living alone, it could mean less supervision or accountability.\n\nShe's 5'1\" and weighs 135 lbs; not sure if physical stats impact risk assessment unless there's a specific reason they matter here, which I don't think is the case.\n\nNo reported depression in the past month is positive. Drug use, however, is a concern\u2014she used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use can be a significant risk factor for reoffending or other issues.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area suggests a possible chaotic home environment, which could contribute to higher risk factors. Urban areas might have more exposure to crime and negative influences.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life personally; this could indicate strong personal beliefs that might either support positive behavior or, if misaligned, lead to other issues, but generally spirituality is seen as protective.\n\nPutting it all together: prior arrests, conviction, lower education, living alone, substance use, and potentially unstable home environment. These factors point towards higher risk. However, she's young and hasn't shown severe mental health issues, which might slightly reduce the confidence level.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
