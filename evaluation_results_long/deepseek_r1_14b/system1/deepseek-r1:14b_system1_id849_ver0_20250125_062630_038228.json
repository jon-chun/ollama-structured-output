I'm supposed to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk and then output a JSON response with \"YES\" or \"NO\" for prediction and a confidence score between 0-100.\n\nFirst, looking at the person's background: she's a 21-year-old female, White. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That arrest might be a concern, but without a conviction, it's less definitive.\n\nShe's of average build and height, nothing physically striking. Lives alone, which is common for her age, especially if she's independent. Unmarried, so no immediate family ties that might influence behavior in certain contexts.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and isn't in college now. She's been holding two jobs this year, indicating she's responsible and possibly financially stable, which can be a positive sign.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014good. However, she's experienced some depression recently, feeling down for several days. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, so that's a point to note.\n\nGrowing up in a rural area with both biological parents might suggest a stable upbringing, but rural areas can vary widely. She considers God influential in her life, which could indicate strong personal beliefs affecting her decisions.\n\nPutting it all together: she has some mitigating factors like no drug use, two jobs, stable living situation. The arrest is a negative point, as well as the recent depression. However, without a conviction and considering her current stable circumstances, the risk might not be extremely high but moderate.\n\nSo, I'd lean towards \"NO\" for high risk, with maybe around 60% confidence because of the arrest and mental health factors, but tempered by other positive indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
