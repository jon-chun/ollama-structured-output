    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze whether these risk factors indicate a high risk for the person described. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk on its own. Gender being female might be relevant depending on crime types. Race could be a factor in some contexts, but I should be cautious about overgeneralizing.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a notable point because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of future offenses. Her height and weight don't seem to relate directly to risk factors, so I'll set that aside.\n\nNever married and living alone might mean fewer social supports, which could be a risk factor. Education-wise, she doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can correlate with higher crime rates because limited opportunities might push someone towards criminal activities.\n\nNo jobs during the past year suggests unemployment, which is a known risk factor for criminal behavior due to lack of income and structure. Drug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant. Substance abuse often correlates with increased criminal activity, especially when drugs are illegal.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible mental health issues. Depression can contribute to risky behaviors or crimes as a coping mechanism. Growing up in an urban area with a household size of four might expose her to more environmental risks like crime or substance use.\n\nConsidering God's role in her life could indicate some level of spirituality, which might be protective, but it's unclear how strong that influence is here.\n\nPutting this all together: prior conviction, unemployment, drug use, mental health struggles, and lack of education are strong indicators. The factors pointing towards lower risk, like being female, might temper the overall risk. I'm leaning towards a high-risk assessment with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
