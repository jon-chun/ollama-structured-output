    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this query where someone wants me to analyze risk factors for a high-risk assessment. The user is posing as a criminal justice expert and needs a JSON response only.\n\nFirst, the person is 19 years old. That's a key factor because younger individuals are often at higher risk. They have been arrested once but not convicted, which might indicate low or moderate risk since no conviction means no formal record, but arrests can still be a concern.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race alone is a significant factor here, but it's noted. He lives alone and hasn't been married, which could mean less support systems in place, potentially increasing risk. \n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which often correlates with lower socioeconomic status and higher risk factors. His employment history shows holding two jobs, which is positive but might be due to financial instability.\n\nHe's used marijuana recently, indicating substance use, which is definitely a red flag for potential criminal behavior. No reported depression in the past month is neutral, but mental health can still play a role if it's unreported or undiagnosed.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother and four others might suggest a challenging upbringing, possibly associated with higher crime rates. His belief in God influencing his life could be seen as both positive (potential for support) and perhaps indicating a need for control or fatalism.\n\nPutting this all together: 19 years old is high risk, arrest without conviction moderate, drug use recent but not severe, education issues, living alone. I'd say there's a moderate likelihood of high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
