    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out whether this individual is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 20 years old. Generally, younger individuals might be at higher risk for recidivism since they're still establishing themselves socially and legally. But it can go either way depending on other factors.\n\nRace is White. I'm not sure how race plays into this specifically, but it's noted that it's a factor to consider in some contexts, though ideally shouldn't be a determinative one.\n\nArrested once without conviction: An arrest without a conviction could indicate lower risk since there's no formal finding of guilt. However, an arrest itself might still be a red flag depending on the context and other factors.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 155 lbs. Not sure how physical stats contribute unless it relates to the nature of past crimes, but nothing indicates that here.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, potentially increasing risk if he lacks community ties.\n\nEducation: High school diploma, not enrolled in college. Higher education can be a protective factor, so without college enrollment, it's a bit of a concern, but high school is still some level of education.\n\nEmployment history: Held 2 jobs during the year. Stable employment is generally a positive sign and could lower risk, as it provides structure and income.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance use can be a significant risk factor, especially if there's ongoing use or dependence. However, since he hasn't been convicted, maybe he sought help or managed it without legal consequences yet.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed in the past month. No current mental health issues reported, which is good as mental health can influence criminal behavior.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 3 in an urban area. Family stability might be a protective factor, but urban areas can have higher crime rates, so it's a mixed bag.\n\nSpirituality: Considers God has something to do with his personal events. Spirituality can sometimes act as a protective factor against criminal behavior, providing a sense of purpose and accountability.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of drug use is a notable concern but he hasn't been convicted, which might indicate some responsible behavior. His employment history shows he's capable of holding jobs, which is positive. Living alone isn't necessarily bad if he has other support systems, though it's unclear here. The arrest without conviction could be a minor issue.\n\nI'm leaning towards moderate risk. There are factors that increase concern (drug use, arrest) but also some protective ones (employment, family background, spirituality). Without more severe risk indicators like prior convictions, mental health issues, or ongoing substance abuse problems, it's probably not the highest risk category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
