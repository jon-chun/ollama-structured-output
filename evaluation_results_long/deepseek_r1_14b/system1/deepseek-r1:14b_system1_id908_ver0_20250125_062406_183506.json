    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this 18-year-old male is at high risk for criminal behavior based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18 and identifies as Black. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might be more impulsive or less settled, but I don't know how much race plays into this without more context about systemic issues.\n\nHe was arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests alone aren't convictions, so that might not carry the same weight. However, an arrest could indicate potential for future issues if there's a pattern.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6\" and 178 lbs. I don't see how physical stats directly relate to criminal risk unless it's about intimidating others, but that seems more relevant in specific crimes like assault.\n\nLiving alone and never married might suggest less stability. Without family support, he could be more vulnerable or have fewer accountability structures, which might increase risk factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can be a factor; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates. But not being enrolled doesn't necessarily mean he's at risk unless there are other factors like unemployment.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment is generally protective against criminal behavior, so having a job is a positive sign. However, holding only one might indicate recent employment or possible issues maintaining it.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use itself isn't necessarily a high-risk factor for serious crimes, but it could be linked to other behaviors or illegal activities. Past drug use might indicate some risk but not severely unless there's more involved.\n\nNo depression reported recently, which is good because mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior if untreated.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four when he was young. Family structure can influence delinquency. Living with both parents or stable caregivers is protective, so living with just the mother might be a moderate risk factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Spirituality can act as a protective factor against crime, providing guidance and reducing antisocial behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors: he's young, has an arrest record, uses drugs, but is employed and hasn't shown signs of depression. The family situation could be a slight risk, but the positive aspects like employment might mitigate that. I'm leaning towards low to moderate risk because while there are some red flags, there are more protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
