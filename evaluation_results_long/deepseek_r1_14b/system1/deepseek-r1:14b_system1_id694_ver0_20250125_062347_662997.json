    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the provided factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age and gender: He's a 19-year-old male. Young males are often more likely to engage in risky behavior, so that could be a red flag.\n\nNext, race isn't typically a predictive factor on its own, but other aspects might play a role.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Prior convictions definitely increase the risk of future offenses, as past behavior is a strong indicator.\n\nLiving alone without being married might mean fewer social supports, which can be a high-risk sign because there's less accountability and support networks.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Lack of higher education or current educational engagement could correlate with higher risk if not pursuing further studies.\n\nEmployment history shows he held seven jobs in the past year. High job turnover might indicate instability or difficulties maintaining consistent employment, which can be linked to stressors that may contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nSubstance use is a significant factor here. He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and more recently, he's been feeling down, even depressed some days. Substance abuse often co-occurs with criminal activity, so this adds to the risk.\n\nFamily background: He grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of five. While urban environments can have higher crime rates, family structure alone isn't definitive. However, without more info on the family environment, it's hard to say.\n\nHis lack of religious belief might not directly impact risk but could affect his support systems or coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting this all together, there are several high-risk factors: prior convictions, recent drug use, job instability, and a history of arrests. These contribute significantly to predicting potential future criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 7 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
