    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male, Black. Age might be relevant since younger individuals could be more volatile, but it's not enough on its own. Race could relate to systemic issues or stereotypes, but I don't have data on that here.\n\nHe was arrested once but never convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future offenses, even if there's no conviction. The fact that he wasn't convicted might suggest the charge was dismissed or he was acquitted, which is a positive sign.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'11\" and 145 lbs. I'm not sure how relevant physical stats are here unless they relate to past behavior, but nothing indicates that.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone could mean less support system, possibly higher risk if he lacks social ties. But it's not definitive.\n\nHigh school diploma, no college enrollment. Education level can sometimes correlate with crime rates, though this is complex and varies widely. Not enrolled in college might suggest limited structure or opportunities currently.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, as financial stress can lead to illegal activities.\n\nNo drug use in four years, not depressed recently. This is positive; substance abuse is a significant factor, but his recent abstention is good. Not feeling depressed also reduces some psychological risks.\n\nGrew up with biological mother in an urban area household of size 4. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, and family dynamics can influence behavior. Being raised in such an environment could contribute to risk factors, though it's not a direct indicator.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Spiritual beliefs are generally protective factors, so this might mitigate some risks.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some negative indicators like arrest, unemployment, living alone, and urban upbringing. But he also has positive factors like no recent drug use, education, and spiritual beliefs. The lack of a conviction is significant because it shows that despite the arrest, there was no wrongdoing proven. Unemployment is a concern but not enough on its own without other issues.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NO\" for high risk because while there are some red flags, several factors suggest he's not currently engaging in risky behavior and has protective elements in his life.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
