    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. I'm not an expert, but I'll go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 18, which is a young adult. Younger individuals might be more impulsive and have higher tendencies towards crime or risky behavior compared to older adults.\n\nRace isn't typically a direct risk factor, so probably neutral on that front.\n\nHe identifies as White\u2014again, not a direct indicator of risk, but in some contexts, socioeconomic factors could play a role, though it's not specified here.\n\nArrested three times and convicted once. That's significant. Multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher risk for future offenses.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'1\" and 215 lbs. Physical size might influence opportunities for certain crimes or perceptions by others, but without more context, it's not a direct indicator on its own.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Being single isn't necessarily a risk factor, but living alone could mean less social support, which might contribute to higher risk behavior.\n\nEducation: has a high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Lack of further education can sometimes correlate with lower socioeconomic status and potentially higher involvement in crime, though it's not a direct cause.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs during the year. Steady employment is usually a positive indicator, suggesting some stability and responsibility, which might mitigate risk factors.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in past four years. While marijuana isn't typically associated with high violent crime rates, any drug use could indicate susceptibility to other illegal activities or impaired judgment.\n\nMental health: he's felt down in the dumps recently, sometimes so that nothing cheered him up. Depression or mood disorders can be linked to higher criminal behavior, possibly due to stress, lack of coping mechanisms, or substance abuse as a form of self-medication.\n\nFamily background: grew up in a household of seven. Larger family size might indicate potential for overcrowding, which could contribute to higher stress or behavioral issues, but it's not a direct indicator without more info on environment and support systems.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God has something to do with his personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against crime, as it provides a sense of purpose and community support. However, if he feels that divine intervention is causing his problems, it might lead to stress or frustration, potentially increasing risk.\n\nPutting this all together, the strongest indicators are multiple arrests/convictions, current substance use, and potential mental health issues. These factors typically point towards higher risk for future criminal behavior. The positive aspects like employment and possible religious beliefs might mitigate some of that, but overall, I would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
