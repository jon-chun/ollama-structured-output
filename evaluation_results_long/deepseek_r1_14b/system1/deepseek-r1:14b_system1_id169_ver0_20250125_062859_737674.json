    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male, white. Age-wise, young adults are often in a transitional phase, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors but not always. Race might not be a significant factor here unless there's a specific context about crime rates, which isn't provided.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism. More arrests mean higher likelihood of future offenses. So that's a red flag for high risk.\n\nHe stands at 6'0\" and weighs 210 lbs. Physical size might relate to certain types of crimes, but without knowing the nature of his past offenses, it's hard to say. However, larger stature isn't necessarily a direct indicator of criminality unless it's related to specific crime types like assault.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Living alone could mean less supervision or support systems in place, which might increase risk factors. However, being unmarried at 21 is pretty normal, so that alone doesn't indicate high risk but combined with other factors, it might add up.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education can be a factor; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates. Not enrolling in college at this age could mean fewer opportunities, potentially increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior. But again, not definitive on its own.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having stable employment is generally a protective factor against crime. It provides income and structure, which can deter criminal activity. So this might slightly lower his risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana. Substance use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if it's recent. Marijuana use could impair judgment or lead to involvement with other illegal activities related to drug distribution or use.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health can be a factor; depression might increase risky behaviors as a coping mechanism. But since he isn't currently depressed, this might not contribute to his risk.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents and a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but family structure can also play a role. Having both parents might offer some stability, though it's a mixed factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a strong belief system that might deter criminal behavior, as religion often provides moral guidelines and support.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators here. Employment is positive but not enough to counteract past offenses. Drug use adds another layer of risk. The fact that he's living alone without a spouse could mean less support. His belief in God might slightly mitigate, but overall, the negative factors outweigh the positives.\n\nSo, considering these points, I would say there's a moderate to high risk. Maybe around 60-70% confidence because while there are some protective factors, the arrests and drug use are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
