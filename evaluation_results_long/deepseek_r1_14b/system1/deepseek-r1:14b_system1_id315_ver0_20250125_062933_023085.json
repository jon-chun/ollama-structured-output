    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this individual is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break down each point.\n\nHe's a 21-year-old male, White. Age is young but not too young; some might still be unstable at 21, but it's also early adulthood. Being White might not be a direct factor unless considering systemic issues.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. Arrests are concerning, especially convictions, as they indicate legal trouble leading to court decisions. This could suggest behavioral issues or repeated problematic behavior.\n\nHeight and weight seem average; no immediate red flags here. Physical stats alone don't predict risk, so probably not significant.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which can be a risk factor if he lacks social connections. Being unmarried is common at 21 but could indicate isolation.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level might affect employability and opportunities. Not being enrolled in college could mean limited future prospects or disengagement.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year, which shows some stability and responsibility. Employment is generally a protective factor against crime, so this seems positive.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years but no depression recently. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent and frequent. However, he didn't report other substances or severe issues, just marijuana.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in an urban area of size 4. Family stability is usually protective. Urban areas might have more exposure to crime but also more resources.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can be protective, as they often provide a sense of purpose and community support.\n\nConsidering all these factors: arrests/convictions are negatives, but employment and religious views are positives. No severe mental health issues reported. The risk is moderate because he does have some positive indicators that might mitigate the negative ones like past convictions.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
