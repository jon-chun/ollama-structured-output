    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly a red flag unless other factors are present. He's male, and statistically, males do commit more crimes than females, so that might contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. I don't think race itself is a direct indicator, but it can be part of the broader social context. His single arrest without conviction could mean he was involved in some illegal activity but wasn't proven guilty yet. That's a bit concerning because even an arrest can sometimes predict future behavior, though not always.\n\nHeight and weight aren't directly risk factors, but sometimes they might relate to physical confrontations or certain types of crime, but I don't think that's significant here. He's living alone, which could mean less supervision and more opportunity for misconduct.\u672a\u5a5a\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u81ea\u7531\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and is in college. Education can be protective against crime because it offers alternatives and opportunities, so this might lower the risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year, which indicates some responsibility but not a long-term stable employment history. Unstable work could mean financial stress, which sometimes correlates with criminal behavior, but one job isn't too bad.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use itself may not be directly linked to high violent crime rates, but it can sometimes indicate substance abuse issues or risk-taking behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health might not be a significant factor here.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area with five siblings. Family stability is usually protective, and living in a rural area might mean less exposure to urban crime factors. But the size of the household could also mean more chaos or potential for conflict, though I don't have enough info on that.\n\nHis belief about God's role in his life suggests some level of religiosity, which often correlates with lower criminal behavior because of moral beliefs and community ties.\n\nPutting it all together: The positive factors include education, being in college, having a job, stable family background, and religious beliefs. Negative factors are male gender, past arrest, drug use, living alone, and one job. \n\nI think the positives might outweigh the negatives. His lack of a conviction despite an arrest is important because it shows he hasn't been proven guilty yet. The risk isn't extremely high but perhaps moderate.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
