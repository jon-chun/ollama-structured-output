    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment query. The user wants me to determine if the given factors indicate high risk, but they want only a JSON response without any extra text.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors:\n\n1. **Age**: 21 years old. Young adults are often in a transitional phase, which might influence behavior.\n2. **Ethnicity**: Hispanic. I'm aware that some studies consider ethnicity as a factor, but it's sensitive and not always directly indicative of risk.\n3. **Arrest Record**: One arrest without conviction. Arrests can be a red flag, even if there's no conviction, as they might indicate potential for misconduct.\n4. **Living Situation**: Lives alone, never married. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a risk factor.\n5. **Education and Employment**: High school diploma, working two jobs. Stable employment can be protective, but the fact he's holding two jobs might indicate financial stress or instability.\n6. **Substance Use**: No drug use in four years. That's a positive sign against substance-related crimes.\n7. **Mental Health**: Not depressed recently. Good mental health is protective.\n8. **Family Background**: Grew up with biological dad, household of three in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family structure might provide some stability.\n9. **Religious Belief**: Doesn't see God's role in his life. Lower religiosity sometimes correlates with higher risk behavior.\n\nConsidering all these, the absence of drug use and depression are positive. However, factors like arrest history, living alone, urban upbringing, and lack of strong social supports (like being married or having a large support network) could increase risk. The two jobs might indicate he's responsible but also under stress. \n\nI'm leaning towards moderate to high risk because the negatives seem more impactful than the positives in this case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
