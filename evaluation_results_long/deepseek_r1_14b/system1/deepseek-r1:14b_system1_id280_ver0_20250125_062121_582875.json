    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to determine if this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21, which is relatively young but old enough to have a criminal history. Being male might be a factor since males generally commit more crimes than females.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I know that in some contexts, race can correlate with crime statistics, though this is a sensitive area and often influenced by systemic issues rather than inherent factors.\n\nArrested 6 times but no convictions. That's interesting because arrests don't always lead to convictions, so maybe he's been lucky or has good legal representation. But multiple arrests could still indicate a tendency towards criminal behavior.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 170 lbs. I'm not sure how relevant physical stats are here unless there's a pattern related to size in crimes, but it doesn't seem significant on its own.\n\nNever married, living alone. Marital status can sometimes be a factor; single individuals might have different risk profiles. Living alone could mean less supervision or support, potentially increasing risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels are often linked to higher crime rates because limited educational opportunities can lead to fewer job prospects, which might push someone towards criminal activities.\n\nEmployment: held 1 job during the year. Steady employment could be a mitigating factor, but only having one job might indicate that he's not involved in multiple income streams or has limited economic stability.\n\nNo drug use in past four years and not depressed recently. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so no recent use is positive. Not feeling depressed also reduces some mental health-related risks, though other factors could still influence behavior.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family stability might provide some protective factors. However, he's now living alone, which changes that dynamic.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal events. Spiritual beliefs can be protective, as they might deter someone from engaging in criminal behavior due to moral beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together: He has multiple arrests without convictions, which is concerning but not definitive. His education level is low, which is a risk factor. Employment is stable but limited. No recent drug use or depression is positive. Urban upbringing could be a negative, and living alone might increase risk. Race is a sensitive factor to consider.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the multiple arrests despite no convictions, lack of education, and other factors like race and urban background. However, his employment and absence of substance abuse temper that a bit.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
