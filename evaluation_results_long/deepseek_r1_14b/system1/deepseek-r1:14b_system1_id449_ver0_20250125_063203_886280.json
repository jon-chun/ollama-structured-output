    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break down each point and think through them.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have higher tendencies towards criminal behavior, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race itself isn't a determining factor in risk assessment, but it could intersect with other factors like socioeconomic status or community context.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. An arrest without a conviction suggests some level of involvement but no formal guilt. However, an arrest can still be a red flag and might indicate potential for future issues.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'2\" and 170 lbs. Physical size isn't directly indicative of criminal risk unless it's related to certain types of crimes, like physical intimidation. But without specific context, this might not add much.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living situation can be a factor; those who live alone might have fewer social supports or more autonomy to engage in risky behavior. Not being married could mean less responsibility, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is often linked with socioeconomic status and opportunities. A GED instead of a high school diploma might indicate some educational challenges or gaps, which can correlate with higher risk factors.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs could mean he's seeking to improve his situation, showing responsibility, but it could also mask other activities if he's working odd jobs without steady employment.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, recidivism, and overall instability. Past drug use suggests potential involvement in illegal activities or related crimes.\n\nNo feelings of depression recently. Mental health is important; the absence of depression doesn't negate other issues like substance abuse or potential undiagnosed mental health problems.\n\n grew up with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more social challenges, which might increase exposure to negative influences.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal circumstances. This perspective could indicate a lack of strong religious support or coping mechanisms, which might influence behavior but isn't directly predictive.\n\nConsidering all these factors: arrest history, drug use, education level, living situation, and background in an urban area, it seems like there are several red flags. However, the lack of a conviction and holding two jobs slightly mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards high risk because substance abuse is a strong indicator, past arrest, and environmental factors all contribute.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
