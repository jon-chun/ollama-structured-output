    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. I'm not an expert, but I'll go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: 20 years old. Young adults are sometimes still developing socially and emotionally, which might influence their behavior. But being 20 isn't necessarily a red flag unless other factors come into play.\n\nGender is female. There's no direct link between gender and criminal risk in general, but it can interact with other factors. For example, substance use or mental health issues might have different implications for females.\n\nRace is White. I don't think race itself is a risk factor, but it's important to consider how systemic issues or societal factors might affect her circumstances. However, without more context on that, it might not be a significant factor here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's concerning because having a criminal record can indicate past behavior that might predict future conduct. Recidivism rates vary, but first-time offenders have varying chances depending on other factors.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'1\" and 110 lbs. Physical stats don't directly correlate with criminal risk unless they're part of a larger issue like bullying or physical health problems, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nMarital status: Never married, not living alone. Living with others might provide support systems that could reduce risk factors, so this might be a mitigating factor.\n\nEducation: High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally seen as protective against criminal behavior because it provides opportunities and instills discipline. This seems like a positive factor.\n\nEmployment: Held 3 jobs during the year. Steady employment can be a good indicator of stability and responsibility, which might lower risk factors.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is definitely a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior, especially if she's using illegal drugs like cocaine.\n\nMental health: Felt down in the dumps some days recently. Mental health issues, such as depression or anxiety, can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or crimes, especially if not managed properly.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 4 in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, but living in an urban area might mean higher exposure to crime and other negative influences. However, she's lived with her parents, which is usually stable unless there were issues like domestic violence or substance abuse at home, which aren't indicated here.\n\nReligious beliefs: Considers God has nothing to do with her personal events. This might not directly impact criminal risk but could affect her support systems if she lacks a religious community.\n\nPutting this all together: She has some protective factors like education and employment, but also significant risk factors such as drug use and mental health struggles. The past conviction is concerning, especially combined with current drug use. Mental health can be a strong predictor of future behavior if not addressed. Her age might mean she's still developing, making her more susceptible to impulsive actions.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because the negative factors seem to outweigh the positives, especially considering the drug use and mental health issues which are significant predictors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year.

At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
