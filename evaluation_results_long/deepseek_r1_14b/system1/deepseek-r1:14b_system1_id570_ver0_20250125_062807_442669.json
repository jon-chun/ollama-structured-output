    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21. I remember that younger adults are often still developing and might be more impulsive, but it's not a direct indicator of risk on its own.\n\nRace: White. I'm not sure how race plays into this. Maybe socioeconomic factors or other variables tied to race could influence risk, but I don't have enough context here.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. Arrests are significant because they indicate past law violations, even if he was only convicted once. Convictions can suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism, depending on the offense details.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'10\", 160 lbs. I don't think physical stats directly correlate with criminal behavior unless it's related to specific crimes like theft or violence where size might play a role, but that's speculative.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Being unmarried can sometimes be a factor if it affects support systems or social networks. Living alone might mean less supervision or accountability.\n\nEducation: High school diploma, not in college. Lower education levels can correlate with higher risk factors because of limited opportunities and possibly lower socioeconomic status.\n\nEmployment: Held one job during the year. Steady employment is usually a positive indicator as it provides structure and income, which can reduce criminal behavior. However, holding only one job might indicate other issues if he's underemployed or facing financial strain.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana and cocaine in past four years. Substance abuse is a major red flag. Both drugs are associated with various crimes, from possession to more serious offenses. Chronic use could impair judgment and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nMental health: No depression reported last month. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, that's a positive point.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in a household of 3 in a rural area. Family stability is generally protective. However, rural areas might have different access to resources or higher crime rates depending on the specific location.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God's role in his life. Some studies suggest that strong religious beliefs can act as a deterrent against crime, providing moral guidance and support systems.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nPositive factors:\n- Employed\n- Stable family background (lived with parents)\n- No reported depression recently\n\nNegative factors:\n- Conviction history\n- Recent drug use\n- Only one job held\n- Lives alone, unmarried\n\nThe presence of a conviction and recent drug use are strong indicators. Drug abuse is particularly concerning as it can lead to criminal behavior to obtain drugs or commit associated crimes.\n\nHis employment might mitigate some risk, but the arrest and drug use likely outweigh that. His living situation and marital status don't add significant protective factors here.\n\nI would lean towards a high-risk assessment due to the combination of past convictions and recent substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
