    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 21 years old. That's young, but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors come into play. He identifies as Black, which might be relevant in some contexts, but I need to consider if this alone contributes to risk.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, especially if there's no record of rehabilitation or change since then. The fact that he was convicted suggests a previous run-in with the law, which could be a bad sign.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'11\" and 200-224 lbs. I'm not sure how relevant physical stats are unless they relate to physical altercations or other specific crimes, but maybe being heavier could imply more risk in some situations?\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which can be a factor if he lacks social ties that help deter crime.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment often correlates with higher risk of criminal behavior because fewer opportunities are available, leading to potential involvement in illegal activities for income.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant indicator of future criminal activity. Without stable employment, someone might turn to crime out of necessity or lack of alternatives.\n\nDrug use: he's used marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse is often linked with higher recidivism rates and involvement in crimes related to drug seeking or distribution.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might seem neutral, but mental health can play a role in risk assessment. However, since there's no indication of current issues, maybe it's not a factor here.\n\nLiving in a household of size 11 when young could indicate a lack of stability or possibly exposure to negative influences. Large households might have higher crime rates or less supervision.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal happenings. This could either be stabilizing (if it deters him from crime) or not relevant, but I'm not sure how much this affects risk.\n\nPutting all these together: prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. Unemployment and lack of education make the situation worse as they limit options. Drug use adds another layer. Living alone without a support system could increase risk. While mental health isn't an issue here, the combination of other factors points towards a higher likelihood of recidivism or future criminal behavior.\n\nI'm leaning toward \"YES\" for high risk but not 100% because there's no info on rehabilitation efforts or current positive influences. Maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
