    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point systematically.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female from an American Indian background. That might be relevant in terms of community context and potential social challenges.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can be a sign of high risk even without convictions, as they may indicate recurring problematic behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests possible educational barriers, which could affect her employability and opportunities, potentially leading to stress or frustration.\n\nCurrently married and living with her spouse might provide some stability, but it's not clear if the relationship is supportive or strained. Unstable relationships can be a risk factor, though without more info, I'm cautious here.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 140 lbs \u2013 physically unremarkable in terms of risk factors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) indicates substance abuse, which is often linked to higher recidivism rates. Recent drug use within the past month suggests ongoing issues.\n\nFeelings of depression (\"down in the dumps\") could be a sign of mental health struggles. Mental health issues are significant risk factors for criminal behavior as they can impair judgment and lead to impulsive actions.\n\nLiving in a rural household with her biological mother at a young age, in a household of size 3. Rural areas might have less access to resources and support systems, which could contribute to higher stress or fewer opportunities. Family dynamics could play a role here too.\n\nBelief that God has something to do with personal events \u2013 this might indicate strong religious beliefs, which can be protective or potentially lead to different kinds of stress if expectations aren't met.\n\nPutting it all together: she has several risk factors like arrests without convictions (indicating possible ongoing issues), substance use, recent depression symptoms, educational challenges, and rural upbringing. However, being married and possibly having a support system could mitigate some risks. The balance leans towards high risk due to the combination of behavioral and situational factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
