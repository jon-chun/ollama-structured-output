    "raw_message_text": "You are given a dictionary where each key is one of the risk factors and the value associated with it is either \"YES\" or \"NO\". The risk factor you are analyzing will be passed into your function as a string (e.g., \"Gender_Male\"). You can assume that the correct answer will always exist in the dictionary.\nYour job is to write an AI model which takes these factors and makes predictions for whether or not this person has risk of developing depression. The output should be a JSON object with two keys: prediction and confidence. The value associated with \"prediction\" will either be \"YES\" or \"NO\" and you must use the correct one based on the provided information.\nThe value associated with \"confidence\" is a number between 0 and 100, where 0 means that there's no chance of developing depression and 100 means it's certain they will develop depression. The closer your guess gets to the actual probability, the more you earn points!\nYour answer must be in JSON format (e.g. { \"prediction\" : \"YES\" } ). You can also include a confidence value between 0 and 100 as well: { \"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\" : 85 }. This is the same format that you will get back from my service if I ask it to predict whether or not someone has depression based on their risk factors!\nThe dictionary of risk factors looks like this (note - do not edit this code):\nrisks = {\n    \"Gender_Male\": \"YES\", # Male is a high-risk factor for developing depression.\n    \"Race_White\": \"NO\",   # The person is non-Hispanic White. This is the reference group in your data set because it has been left out of the analysis (i.e., they are not considered part of any risk groups). So you don't need to worry about this variable when making predictions!\n    \"Incident_Conviction\": \"YES\", # The person was convicted for a crime at some point in their life. This is another high-risk factor for developing depression.\n    \"Height_Feet\": 5.11,  # The height of the individual (in feet). You don't need to worry about this variable when making predictions! It won't affect your results since it will always be equal to \"Gender_Male\" or \"Incident_Conviction\" depending on which one is true for them\n    \"Weight_Pounds\": 182, # The weight of the individual (in pounds). You don't need to worry about this variable when making predictions! It won't affect your results since it will always be equal to \"Incident_Conviction\" or \"Height_Feet\" depending on which one is true for them\n    \"MaritalStatus\": \"YES\", # The person is currently unmarried. This is another high-risk factor for developing depression. However, note that we don't know whether they are single because they were divorced by their partner or because they chose to live alone! So you need to use common sense when making predictions based on this variable (e.g., if someone says \"no\" then assume it means 'married')\n    \"EmploymentStatus\": \"NO\", # The person is currently unemployed. This does NOT indicate a high risk for developing depression. Note that we don't know whether they are out of work because they were fired from their job or because they chose to stop working! So you need to use common sense when making predictions based on this variable (e.g., if someone says \"yes\" then assume it means 'unemployed')\n    \"Education\": \"NO\", # The person does not have a college degree. Note that we don't know whether they dropped out of high school or chose to forgo their education! So you need to use common sense when making predictions based on this variable (e.g., if someone says 'yes' then assume it means 'graduated from college')\n    \"Education_GED\": \"YES\", # The person has earned a GED certificate in the past four years. This does NOT indicate high risk for developing depression! Note that we don't know whether they dropped out of school or chose to get their GED! So you need to use common sense when making predictions based on this variable (e.g., if someone says 'yes' then assume it means 'earned a high school diploma')\n    \"Employment_Duration\": 1, # The person has held one job in the past year. This does NOT indicate that they are at risk for developing depression! Note that we don't know whether this is their first or second job since last year! So you need to use common sense when making predictions based on this variable (e.g., if someone says 'no' then assume it means 'employed more than once')\n    \"DrugUse_None\": \"NO\", # The person has used drugs in the past four years. This does NOT indicate high risk for developing depression! Note that we don't know whether they are addicted or not and how often they use them! So you need to use common sense when making predictions based on this variable (e.g., if someone says 'yes' then assume it means 'uses drugs regularly')\n    \"Depression_None\": \"YES\" # The person has never felt depressed over the past month. This does NOT indicate that they are at risk for developing depression! Note that we don't know whether this is their first time feeling sad or if they have been having these feelings for years! So you need to use common sense when making predictions based on this variable (e.g., if someone says 'no' then assume it means 'has felt depressed before')\n}",
