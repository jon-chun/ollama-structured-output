The individual's youth, lack of extensive criminal history (one arrest and conviction), no drug use in recent years, stable employment history, and belief system are indicators that do not strongly correlate with high recidivism rates according to empirical studies.\n\nWhile the absence of formal education is a concern, it does not by itself indicate high risk. Living alone may suggest limited social support but is also common among young adults. The individual's age and gender (being female) generally correspond to lower risk profiles compared to older individuals or males.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 65% due to the potential for unknown factors that could influence risk, such as details about her conviction, psychological evaluation results, and other contextual elements not provided in the description.",
