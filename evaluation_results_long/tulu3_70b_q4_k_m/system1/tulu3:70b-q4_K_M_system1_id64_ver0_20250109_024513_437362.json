    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\nThis decision is based on the provided risk factors:\n\n- **Age**: At 22, she falls within an age range where criminal behavior can sometimes be attributed to youthful indiscretion or a period of experimentation.\n  \n- **Gender and Ethnicity**: Being female and White historically correlates with lower crime rates compared to other demographics.\n\n- **Criminal History**: A single arrest and conviction may suggest a minor infraction rather than a pattern of high-risk behavior. No mention of the nature of the crime could imply it's not serious or violent.\n\n- **Physical Attributes**: Her physical attributes (height, weight) do not typically indicate risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\n- **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Living alone without being married at 22 is common and does not inherently raise her risk profile. \n\n- **Education and Employment**: Having a high school diploma with one job during the year suggests some level of stability. Not attending college isn't unusual or an indicator of criminal behavior.\n\n- **Drug Use**: Past use of marijuana, which is increasingly decriminalized or legal in many jurisdictions, may not significantly raise her risk profile unless it's part of a pattern of substance abuse.\n\n- **Mental Health**: No recent depression suggests she might be managing mental health well.\n\n- **Family Background and Environment**: A stable family environment growing up (both biological parents, household size 4) could indicate a supportive upbringing. Urban living environments can present challenges but don't inherently increase risk without other contributing factors.\n\n- **Religious Beliefs**: Considering that God influences personal events is common and does not correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, the provided risk factors suggest she's at low to moderate risk for future criminal behavior. The confidence level of 75% reflects a cautious assessment due to limited detail on her conviction history and drug use. Without specific details about the nature of her arrest or deeper insight into her personal circumstances, this prediction should be considered with caution.",
