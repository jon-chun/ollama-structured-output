    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```\nBased on the provided risk factors:\n\n- **Demographic Factors**: Being female and young typically lowers criminal recidivism risks. White individuals have generally lower crime rates compared to other ethnic groups.\n\n- **Criminal History**: One arrest and conviction do not necessarily indicate a high risk for reoffending, especially if it was an isolated incident or non-violent offense.\n\n- **Physical Characteristics**: Height and weight are unlikely to impact criminal behavior significantly.\n\n- **Social Factors**:\n    - **Marital Status**: Not being married is common at this age and does not substantially increase risk.\n    - **Living Arrangement**: Living with others can be a protective factor, as it provides more social support and monitoring.\n  \n- **Educational Attainment**: Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and potential for better employment prospects, which are generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\n- **Employment Status**: Holding one job during the year is not necessarily indicative of instability or risk.\n\n- **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use alone does not usually indicate high-risk behavior, especially considering it's a common substance used among young adults and its legality varies by jurisdiction.\n\n- **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed over the past month might be seen as a positive indicator for mental health stability.\n\n- **Family Background**:\n    - Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4 is generally considered a stable upbringing.\n    - Growing up in a rural area may have less exposure to urban crime but can also mean fewer social and economic opportunities.\n\n- **Religious Belief**: The belief that God has nothing to do with personal happenings does not inherently increase criminal risk; it's more of a personal worldview than an indicator of behavior.\n\nConsidering these factors, the risk for reoffending seems moderate. While past drug use and criminal conviction are concerning, her stable social support, educational engagement, and lack of recent mental health issues suggest that she is at a relatively low risk for future offenses. The confidence level is set at 80%, indicating strong confidence but acknowledging potential unknowns or changes in circumstances.",
