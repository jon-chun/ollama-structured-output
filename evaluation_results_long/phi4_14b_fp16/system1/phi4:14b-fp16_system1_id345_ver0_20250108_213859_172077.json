However, this level of job change isn't typically associated with high recidivism risk.\n\n6. **Substance Use:** Past marijuana use is noted, but without current drug use or alcohol issues, it's not a strong indicator of future criminal behavior.\n\n7. **Mental Health:** No reported depression in the past month suggests stable mental health at present.\n\n8. **Family Background:** A rural upbringing with both biological parents and a religious belief system can be protective factors against recidivism.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present, they do not collectively indicate a high risk of reoffending. The confidence level is moderate due to the limited data on certain aspects like current behavior or deeper family dynamics.",
