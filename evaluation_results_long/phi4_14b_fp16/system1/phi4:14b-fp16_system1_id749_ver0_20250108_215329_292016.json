A single arrest without conviction typically indicates low recidivism risk unless there are other aggravating factors present.\n\n3. **Employment and Education**: Holding one job in the past year shows some level of stability, though not optimal. Having a high school diploma is positive but not having further education or employment could be concerning if it continues to limit opportunities.\n\n4. **Substance Use**: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) within four years indicates a risk factor for potential future substance abuse issues, which can correlate with criminal behavior. However, the absence of recent use reduces immediate concern.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: The individual has not felt depressed in the past month, suggesting no current mental health crises that could elevate risk.\n\n6. **Family and Social Background**: Growing up in a stable family environment (with both biological parents) is generally protective against future criminal behavior. Living alone now might pose some risks related to social isolation, but it\u2019s not inherently high-risk without other negative factors.\n\n7. **Religious Belief**: A belief that God has something to do with personal outcomes can be a stabilizing factor for many individuals, potentially reducing risk if it provides moral guidance and community support.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests a moderate risk level. There are some concerning elements (e.g., past drug use), but there are also protective factors in place (e.g., family background, lack of depression). Thus, the prediction leans towards \"NO\" for high risk with moderate confidence given the available data.",
