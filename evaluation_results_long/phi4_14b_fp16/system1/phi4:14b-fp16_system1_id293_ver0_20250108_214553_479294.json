However, this alone does not indicate high risk.\n\n2. **Criminal History:** He has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction is less indicative of ongoing risk.\n\n3. **Demographics and Socioeconomic Status:**\n   - Education: Has a high school diploma.\n   - Employment: Held two jobs during the year, suggesting some level of stability.\n   - Marital Status: Married and living with spouse, which can be stabilizing factors.\n\n4. **Substance Use:** Past use of marijuana is noted, but there's no indication of current use or abuse.\n\n5. **Mental Health:** Reports feeling down occasionally in the past month, suggesting possible depressive symptoms. However, without further information on severity or treatment, this alone does not indicate high risk.\n\n6. **Family Background and Beliefs:**\n   - Grew up in a larger household (size 6), which is neutral without additional context.\n   - Disbelief in personal influence of God could suggest certain worldviews but isn't directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** While there are some factors that could contribute to risk, such as age and past substance use, the presence of stabilizing factors like employment and marriage, along with lack of current criminal activity or severe mental health issues, suggests a lower overall risk. The confidence level is set at 70 due to potential underreporting or unknowns in areas like mental health severity and ongoing substance use.",
