His religious belief may provide additional personal guidance and support.\n\n6. **Education Level**: Enrollment in a 2-year college indicates ongoing engagement in education, which is generally associated with lower risk levels.\n\nOverall, while there are factors that could contribute to moderate concern (e.g., job instability), the lack of convictions, positive mental health status, current educational pursuits, and supportive living environment suggest a low overall risk. The confidence level is set at 85 due to these mitigating factors outweighing potential risks.",
