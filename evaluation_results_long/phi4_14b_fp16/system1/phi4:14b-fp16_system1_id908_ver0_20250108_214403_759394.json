Living alone might imply independence, which can be positive or negative depending on social support networks.\n\n- **Substance Use:** Past marijuana use is noted, but without current usage or escalation to harder substances, it\u2019s not highly predictive of future risk.\n\n- **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed recently suggests a stable mental health state currently, reducing the risk associated with mental health issues.\n\n- **Family and Religious Beliefs:** Living in a household of size 4 during childhood might imply some level of family support. Believing that God has a role in personal outcomes can be stabilizing for some individuals.\n\nOverall, while there are factors to monitor (e.g., substance use, socioeconomic stability), the combination of these factors does not strongly indicate high risk at this time. The confidence is moderately high due to the lack of more severe indicators such as multiple arrests or convictions, mental health issues, or unstable living conditions.",
