Additionally, living alone may lack social support systems which are crucial for rehabilitation or positive behavioral change. Although there is no definitive prediction due to the complexity of human behavior, these factors collectively indicate a moderate to high risk. The confidence level reflects uncertainty inherent in predicting individual outcomes based on statistical patterns.",
