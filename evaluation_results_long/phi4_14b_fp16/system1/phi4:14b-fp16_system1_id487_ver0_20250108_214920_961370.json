It suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to future issues.\n  \n- **Drug Use and Mental Health:** Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) combined with feelings of depression are significant risk factors for recidivism or other negative outcomes.\n\n- **Social Factors:** Living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which can be a stressor and contribute to higher risk. \n\n- **Age and Education:** While being enrolled in college is positive, the combination of age (21) and previous behavioral issues (arrests) increases concern compared to older individuals with more stable life circumstances.\n\n- **Lack of Religious Belief:** Perceiving no personal connection to a higher power might correlate with lower adherence to societal norms or guidance systems for some individuals.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest a heightened risk, though the presence of ongoing education and employment provides some mitigating context. The confidence level reflects this balance between significant risk indicators and positive factors.",
