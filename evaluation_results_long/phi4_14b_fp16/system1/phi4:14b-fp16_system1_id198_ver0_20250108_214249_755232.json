Younger males can statistically be at higher risk for certain offenses, but this alone does not indicate high risk without additional negative factors.\n\n2. **Criminal History:** Two arrests with convictions suggest some level of past involvement in criminal activity. However, the number of prior offenses is relatively low, indicating a moderate rather than high risk.\n\n3. **Employment and Education:** Holding one job during the year and being enrolled in college suggests stability and commitment to education, which are protective factors against recidivism.\n\n4. **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) can be concerning, but since there is no indication of recent use or dependency, this factor alone does not suggest high risk.\n\n5. **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests a stable mental health status currently.\n\n6. **Family Background:** Living with both biological parents at a young age and considering spirituality as influential are generally positive indicators for stability and moral guidance.\n\n7. **Living Situation:** Living alone is not inherently negative but can be concerning if it indicates social isolation. However, there's no specific indication of such in the provided factors.\n\nOverall, while some risk factors are present (e.g., criminal history, drug use), many protective factors balance these out, leading to a lower overall risk prediction with moderate confidence.",
