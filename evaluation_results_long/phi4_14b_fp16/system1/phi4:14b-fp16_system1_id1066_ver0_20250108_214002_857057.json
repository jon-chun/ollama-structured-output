Lack of education (no high school diploma/GED) is associated with higher risk.\n\n3. **Criminal History:** Multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential future criminal behavior.\n\n4. **Employment Status:** Not having held a job in the past year suggests economic instability, which can be a contributing factor to recidivism.\n\n5. **Drug Use:** Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a risk factor for continued substance abuse and related criminal activity.\n\n6. **Social Support and Beliefs:** Living alone with no mention of strong social support networks or religious/spiritual beliefs might indicate lower levels of community integration, which can be protective against recidivism.\n\n7. **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed recently is a positive factor, but the absence of mental health issues does not negate other risk factors.\n\nThe confidence level is set at 75 due to the presence of multiple significant risk factors, though individual circumstances and interventions could alter outcomes.",
