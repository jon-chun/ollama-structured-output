However, this should be considered cautiously and contextually.\n\n3. **Criminal History**: The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests some interaction with the criminal justice system but no proven criminal behavior.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics**: His height is significantly above average, which could be a factor in certain risk assessments related to physical altercations or intimidation.\n\n5. **Social and Economic Factors**:\n   - Living alone and never married may indicate limited social support.\n   - Lack of a high school diploma or GED can correlate with lower socioeconomic status and higher risk.\n   - Holding two jobs within a year might suggest instability in employment, though it could also indicate effort to maintain employment.\n\n6. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use is noted, but without current usage information, its impact on risk is limited.\n\n7. **Mental Health**: No recent depression indicates stable mental health, which is a positive factor.\n\n8. **Family Background**: Growing up in a household of four with his biological mother provides some insight into family structure, though no negative indicators are mentioned here.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Belief that God has a role in personal outcomes can be stabilizing for some individuals, potentially mitigating risk.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of demographic factors (age, gender), social-economic status (education level, employment history), and limited criminal history suggest a moderate to high risk. However, the lack of current substance use and stable mental health are positive indicators. Confidence is set at 65 due to the mixed nature of these factors and the need for more comprehensive data for a definitive assessment.",
