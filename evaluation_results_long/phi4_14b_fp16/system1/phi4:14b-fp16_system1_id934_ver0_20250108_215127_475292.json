Younger individuals may have a higher risk of recidivism due to impulsivity, but this alone does not indicate high risk.\n   - Race: Identifying as Black can correlate with systemic biases in the criminal justice system; however, race itself should not be used as an indicator of individual risk.\n\n2. **Criminal History**:\n   - Arrests and Convictions: He has been arrested once and convicted once. This indicates some past involvement with the legal system but does not necessarily predict high future risk unless coupled with other negative factors.\n   \n3. **Personal Characteristics**:\n   - Physical Attributes: His height and weight are average, providing no specific insight into his risk level.\n   - Marital Status: He is never married and lives alone, which can sometimes be a factor in recidivism if it indicates social isolation or lack of support networks, but this alone isn't determinative.\n\n4. **Education and Employment**:\n   - Education: Having a high school diploma suggests basic educational attainment, which is generally positive for reintegration.\n   - Employment: Holding one job during the year shows some level of stability, although more consistent employment could further reduce risk.\n\n5. **Substance Use and Mental Health**:\n   - Substance Use: No drug use in the past four years indicates a lower risk factor compared to active substance users.\n   - Mental Health: No reported depression over the past month suggests stable mental health at this time.\n\n6. **Family and Social Context**:\n   - Household Size: Growing up in a household of size 3 does not inherently indicate high or low risk without additional context regarding family dynamics.\n   - Religious Belief: Considering that God has something to do with personal outcomes can be indicative of a supportive belief system, potentially providing resilience against negative behaviors.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe factors present suggest moderate stability and some positive indicators for future behavior. While he does have a criminal record, the absence of substance abuse, mental health issues, or significant social instability suggests a lower risk profile. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the limited amount of data available to make a highly precise prediction but considering the overall context and available information.",
