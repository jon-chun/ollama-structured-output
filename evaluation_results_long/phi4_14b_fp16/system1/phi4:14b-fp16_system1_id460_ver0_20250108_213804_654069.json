Additionally, the lack of religious affiliation or belief in a higher power can sometimes correlate with less social conformity, though this is not deterministic.\n\nWhile these factors collectively suggest a moderate risk level, it's important to note that predicting human behavior involves significant uncertainty, hence the confidence rating is set at 65 rather than higher.",
