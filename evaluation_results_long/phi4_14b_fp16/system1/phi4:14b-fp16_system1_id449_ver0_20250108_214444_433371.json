This indicates some interaction with the justice system, but without conviction, it doesn't strongly indicate high risk.\n\n- **Physical Attributes:** Height and weight are neutral factors in assessing criminal risk unless directly related to specific offenses (e.g., violent crimes requiring physical strength).\n\n- **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Never married and not living alone might suggest less stability, but this is mitigated by other factors like employment history.\n\n- **Education and Employment:** Having a GED and holding two jobs in the past year suggests some level of responsibility and engagement with society.\n\n- **Substance Use:** Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over four years is concerning, but there's no current indication of active substance abuse. This factor alone doesn't indicate high risk without additional context.\n\n- **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed recently suggests stable mental health at the moment.\n\n- **Family Background:** Growing up in an urban area with a household size of 4 can be associated with higher risks, but this is balanced by his current stability factors.\n\n- **Religious Belief:** A belief that God has no personal involvement might suggest lower religiosity, which some studies link to higher risk behavior. However, this factor alone isn't strong enough for high-risk prediction without other corroborating evidence.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present, they do not strongly indicate a high risk of future criminal activity or behavioral issues based on the provided data. The confidence level is moderate (70) due to the mixed nature of the risk factors and lack of definitive indicators pointing towards high risk.",
