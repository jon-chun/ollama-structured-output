This suggests potential issues but does not strongly indicate high risk without convictions.\n\n3. **Education and Employment:** Enrollment in school and having held a job are positive indicators suggesting stability and engagement in prosocial activities.\n\n4. **Substance Use:** No drug use in the past four years is a favorable factor, reducing concerns about substance-related risks.\n\n5. **Mental Health Concerns:** The reported feelings of depression could be concerning, but without further details on severity or treatment, it's not definitive for high risk.\n\n6. **Family and Living Situation:** Growing up in a large household in an urban area can present challenges, but her current living situation (alone) shows independence. \n\n7. **Religious Beliefs:** Having faith might provide personal support and stability.\n\nOverall, while there are some areas of concern, particularly regarding mental health and arrest history without convictions, the balance of factors leans towards a lower risk assessment with moderate confidence due to positive educational and employment engagement.",
