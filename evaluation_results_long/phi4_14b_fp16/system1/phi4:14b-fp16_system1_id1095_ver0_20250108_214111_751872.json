Additionally, an expressed belief that God has no role in personal events might suggest a lack of spiritual or community-based support structures often considered protective factors.\n\n6. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** The absence of drug use and recent depression are positive indicators but do not fully mitigate other risk factors.\n\nOverall, the combination of criminal history, unemployment, and family separation suggests a higher risk, though mitigating factors like no current substance abuse or mental health issues temper this assessment slightly. Hence, a confidence level of 75 is chosen to reflect these mixed influences.",
