Having held two jobs shows some level of stability and responsibility.\n\n4. **Substance Use**: Past marijuana use is noted, but current non-use over the past four years reduces immediate risk related to substance abuse.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: Absence of depression symptoms recently is a positive indicator for mental health stability.\n\n6. **Family Background**: Growing up in a rural area with both biological parents and considering religion as influential suggests potential supportive structures.\n\n7. **Living Situation**: Living alone at this age can be typical for college students, which does not inherently indicate high risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present (such as past drug use and a criminal record), the mitigating factors like education engagement, employment history, and stable family background suggest that the overall risk level is low. The confidence rating reflects moderate certainty given these balanced considerations.",
