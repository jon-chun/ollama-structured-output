The individual's young age, educational pursuit, lack of convictions, and relatively stable living situation suggest a lower immediate risk compared to profiles with multiple arrests or convictions, significant criminal history, unstable living conditions, or untreated mental health issues.\n\nHowever, past drug use is noted as a potential concern, but it does not immediately elevate the risk without additional factors such as ongoing substance abuse or related offenses. The lack of recent depression and continued education are positive indicators.\n\nWhile these factors collectively suggest a lower risk profile, the confidence level reflects some uncertainty due to the limited information on personal behavior patterns, social relationships, or deeper psychological assessments that could influence future risks. Thus, a moderate confidence score is assigned given the incomplete picture.",
