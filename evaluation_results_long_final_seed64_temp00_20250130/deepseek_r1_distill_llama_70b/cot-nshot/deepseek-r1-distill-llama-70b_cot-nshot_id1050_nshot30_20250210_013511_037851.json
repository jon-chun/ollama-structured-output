    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Hispanic male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 22 isn't too young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests and a conviction are strong indicators. For instance, Example #2 had 7 arrests and a conviction leading to a YES. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 185 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried might indicate instability. Maybe a medium risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. This is a big one. Many examples with no diploma had higher recidivism. So high risk.\n\nHe's held 5 jobs in a year. Job instability could mean he's struggling, which might lead to criminal activity. High risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a strong indicator. Examples like #2 and #20 had multiple drug uses leading to YES. So high risk.\n\nFelt down some of the past month. Depression can increase recidivism, but it's not as strong as other factors. Maybe medium risk.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable upbringing might lower risk, but urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates. So maybe medium.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, like in Example #8. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are arrests/convictions, no diploma, job instability, drug use. Medium factors are age, living situation, depression, upbringing. Low factors are physical traits and religious belief. The high factors are strong, so I'm leaning towards a YES prediction. Confidence is around 85% because several high-risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"high\", \"Holding five jobs in a year suggests instability, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs increases likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Some depression can contribute to recidivism but isn't as strong as other factors.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate social isolation, a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing might increase exposure to crime.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may act as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
