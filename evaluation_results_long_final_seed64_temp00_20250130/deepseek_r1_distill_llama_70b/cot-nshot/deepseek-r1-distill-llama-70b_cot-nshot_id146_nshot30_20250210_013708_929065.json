    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old White female and predict whether she'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 22 isn't too young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators. For instance, Example #2 had 7 arrests and was convicted, leading to a YES. So her two arrests and a conviction might be a medium to high risk. I'll say high because even though it's not as many as some others, it's still significant.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'7\" and 135 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a major role unless extreme. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried might not be a strong indicator on its own. Maybe low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective, so having a diploma is good, but not being enrolled might mean less stability. This could be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held five jobs in the past year. Job instability is a red flag. In Example #2, having three jobs was a factor. Five jobs suggest instability, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a strong indicator. Example #5 used no drugs and had a YES, but others with drug use often had higher recidivism. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since she hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk. So low risk here.\n\nShe lived in a household of size three as a child. Household size didn't seem to be a major factor in the examples, so maybe low risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, possibly indicating stability or support. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are number of arrests/convictions, job instability, and drug use. Medium factors are age. Low factors are the rest. The high factors are strong indicators, so I'm leaning towards a YES prediction. But considering she has a diploma and no recent depression, maybe the confidence isn't super high. I'll say 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight, no significant risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Never married and living alone is common but not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not enrolled in college.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Five jobs in a year suggests instability, a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana and cocaine increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Household size isn't a significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
