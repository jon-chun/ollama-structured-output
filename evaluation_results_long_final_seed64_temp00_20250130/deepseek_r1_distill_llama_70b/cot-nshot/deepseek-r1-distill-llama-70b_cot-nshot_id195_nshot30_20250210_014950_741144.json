    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight to each based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Looking at the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 22 isn't too young, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. In the examples, higher arrest numbers (like 5, 6, 7) often led to a YES outcome. Four is significant, so I'd say high risk here.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 140 lbs. In the examples, being underweight or average didn't seem to correlate much with recidivism, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. In the examples, being married or living with someone often reduced the risk, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor; having a diploma is good, but not being enrolled might not be as bad. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism, so having a job is positive. Maybe low risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially multiple drugs, was a high risk in examples. But he only used marijuana, so maybe medium.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues like depression were a risk in some examples, so not feeling depressed is a low risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high arrest/conviction, medium drug use, but several low risk factors like marriage, stable upbringing, and employment. The high arrest count is a strong indicator, but the protective factors might balance it out. I'm leaning towards a YES prediction, but with moderate confidence because of the mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a range where recidivism is possible but not extremely high.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"4 arrests indicate a significant history of legal issues.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held a job suggests some stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than multiple drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces immediate risk factors.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
