    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 20 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's Hispanic, and looking at the examples, ethnicity alone doesn't seem to be a strong predictor. It's more about other factors, so I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to \"NO\" outcomes, like in Example 4 and 8. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 180 lbs. In the examples, larger individuals sometimes had higher risk, but it's not a consistent factor. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living alone was a factor in some cases, but not living alone might mean more family support, which could be protective. So maybe low risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. In the examples, lack of education was a significant risk factor, often leading to higher recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be protective, but only having one job might indicate instability. I'm not sure, but maybe medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. This is a positive factor, as drug use was a strong predictor in many examples. So low risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, were linked to higher recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving in a household of size 11 as a child. Large household size might indicate instability or neglect, which could be a risk. I'll consider this medium.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, a lack of religious belief was associated with higher risk, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is the lack of education. The medium factors are the large household and lack of religious influence. The rest are low. So overall, I think the risk is on the lower side, but not too low. I'll predict \"NO\" with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average build, not indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Never married is common and not a strong risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job suggests some stability but limited employment history.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Large household size may indicate unstable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may be associated with higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
