    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic female and predict whether she'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, might have a higher risk because they're still developing and might be more impulsive. But 20 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Looking at the examples, males seem to have higher recidivism rates. So being female might lower her risk. That could be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's Hispanic. The examples don't show a strong correlation with race directly, so I might consider this a low risk factor unless other factors interact.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction could mean it was a minor offense or a first-time mistake. This might be a low risk factor because it's not a repeated offense.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to play a significant role in the examples. I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Living with others might provide more support, which could reduce recidivism. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit her opportunities. This could be a medium risk factor because lack of further education might lead to unemployment or instability.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides structure and income. Having one job is better than none, but maybe not as stable as having multiple jobs. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and illegal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since she's not feeling depressed now, this might lower her risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults as a child. Unstable family environments can increase risk, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't consider God important. In some examples, religious beliefs seemed to lower recidivism, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. However, she has some protective factors like being female, having a diploma, and being employed. The lack of conviction and stable living situation also help. So while there's a notable risk due to drug use, the other factors might mitigate it. I'm leaning towards a 'NO' prediction, but I'm not very confident because drug use is a strong predictor. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is considered young but not extremely high risk\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"female gender is associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic background doesn't strongly correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"single arrest without conviction suggests lower risk\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"average height and weight don't indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"not married but living with others may provide support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma is protective, but no college may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"having one job provides some stability but not as much as multiple jobs\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"no recent depression reduces risk\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"unstable childhood living situation increases risk\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"lack of religious belief may slightly increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
