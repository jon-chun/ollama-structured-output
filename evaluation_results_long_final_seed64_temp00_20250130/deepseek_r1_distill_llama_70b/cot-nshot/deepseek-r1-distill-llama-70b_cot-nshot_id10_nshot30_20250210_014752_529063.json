    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 22 isn't too young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially multiple convictions, were more likely to recidivate. Since he's only been arrested once, this might be a lower risk, but the conviction could indicate some seriousness, so maybe medium.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 140 lbs. Looking at the examples, weight and height didn't seem to be strong predictors. Some who were heavier had higher risks, but others didn't. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being married sometimes correlated with lower recidivism. Since he's single and living alone, maybe that's a medium risk because it could indicate less stability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. People with higher education or enrolled in college had lower recidivism rates in the examples. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can reduce recidivism. Having a job, even one, is better than none, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially multiple substances, was a high risk in examples. But he only used marijuana, which is less severe than cocaine. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe felt down some of the past month. Depression or low mood was a risk factor in some cases, but not as strong as others. So maybe medium.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background might lower risk, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some medium risk factors like single arrest, conviction, living alone, drug use, and depression. But he also has protective factors like education and stable upbringing. The conviction and drug use are concerning, but his education might mitigate that. So I'm leaning towards a lower risk, predicting NO with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age bracket for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest, which is a lower indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"medium\", \"Having been convicted once increases the risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in a 4-year college is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held a job indicates stability and reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time could indicate mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can be a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
