    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 22 isn't too young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially those convicted, had higher recidivism. Since he hasn't been convicted, this might lower his risk, so maybe low.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 185 lbs. Looking at the examples, size didn't seem to be a major factor unless it was extreme. So I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone sometimes correlated with higher risk, maybe because of less social support. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education is a big factor. Lack of education often leads to higher recidivism, so this is high risk.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so this is high.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a strong indicator of higher recidivism. This is high risk.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so medium risk.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults in an urban area as a child. Unstable living situations can contribute to higher risk, so medium.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, religious beliefs seemed to lower recidivism, so not having them might slightly increase risk, but maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are education and unemployment, both high. Drug use is also high. Medium factors include living situation and mental health. The rest are low. So overall, the risk is on the higher side, but not the highest. I'll predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a range where recidivism risk is moderate, not particularly high or low.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs (marijuana and cocaine) significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can contribute to higher recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"living environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with non-biological adults may contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may slightly increase risk but is less significant.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
