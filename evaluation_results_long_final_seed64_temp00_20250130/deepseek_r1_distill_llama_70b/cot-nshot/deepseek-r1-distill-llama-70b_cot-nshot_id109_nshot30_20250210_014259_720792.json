    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Looking at the examples, most people are around 18-22, and age alone doesn't seem to be a strong indicator. So I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially multiple convictions, were more likely to recidivate. Since he's only been arrested once, I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably a low risk factor. It doesn't seem to correlate much with recidivism in the examples.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. In the examples, being married or living with someone seemed to reduce recidivism risk, so this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. In the examples, lack of education was a significant risk factor, often leading to higher recidivism. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment seems to reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use was a big factor in many examples leading to YES outcomes, so not using drugs is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nHe's been feeling down some of the time. Depression or low mood was a risk factor in some cases, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nLiving in a large household as a child (size 8). Household size didn't seem to be a major factor in the examples, so low risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In the examples, this sometimes was a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from education and medium from depression are the main concerns. However, his stable living situation, employment, and no drug use are positives. So I think the prediction is NO, but I'm about 65% confident because the lack of education is a strong factor but other factors might mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (22)\", \"low\", \"Age is within a range where recidivism risk is not significantly elevated.\"),\n    (\"Arrested 1 time and convicted\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction may indicate some risk, but not as high as multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight (average)\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Married and living with spouse\", \"low\", \"Stable relationship may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Held 2 jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Employment can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Absence of drug use reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Felt down some of the time\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Lived in household of size 8\", \"low\", \"Household size alone is not a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Believes God has something to do with personal happenings\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
