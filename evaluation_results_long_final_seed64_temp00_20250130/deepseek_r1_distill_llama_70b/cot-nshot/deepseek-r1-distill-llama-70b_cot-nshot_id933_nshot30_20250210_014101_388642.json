    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might not have stable life structures. But I'm not sure if 18 is considered high risk on its own. Maybe medium.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially those who have been convicted, were more likely to recidivate. Since he hasn't been convicted, that might lower his risk. So maybe low for this factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'0\" and 185 lbs. Looking at the examples, larger individuals didn't necessarily have a clear pattern. Some with higher weights recidivated, others didn't. So maybe this isn't a significant factor. I'll mark it as low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried didn't seem to correlate strongly. Maybe medium because living alone could indicate less support, but not a strong indicator.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This seems important. In the examples, lack of education was a risk factor. Without a diploma, it might limit job opportunities, leading to higher recidivism. So high risk here.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having a job might reduce recidivism, so this could be a protective factor. Maybe low risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use was a significant factor in many examples. Since he hasn't used drugs, this lowers his risk. So low.\n\nNot feeling depressed. Mental health issues, like depression, were linked to higher recidivism in some cases. Since he's not depressed, this is a positive. Low risk.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a stable household. A supportive family environment can reduce recidivism. So this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In some examples, religious beliefs were present in both recidivist and non-recidivist cases. It might provide support, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the main risk is the lack of education. However, he has a job, no drug use, stable upbringing, and no depression. These protective factors might outweigh the risks. So I'm leaning towards a NO prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is a transitional age that may pose moderate risk due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held one job indicates some stability and reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk factors associated with mental health.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
