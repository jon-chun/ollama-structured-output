    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 22 isn't too young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, are a strong indicator. For instance, Example #2 had 7 arrests and a conviction leading to a YES. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 235 lbs. In the examples, larger individuals sometimes had higher risk, but it's not a consistent factor. I think this might be a low risk factor since it's not as directly correlated as other factors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone didn't seem to be a major factor, but being unmarried might indicate less stability. Maybe a medium risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. This is a big one. Many examples with no diploma had higher recidivism. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so having jobs might lower the risk. This could be a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use was a significant factor in many YES outcomes, so not using drugs is a positive sign. This is a low risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues, like depression, were linked to higher recidivism in some examples. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a large household (size 10) in an urban area. Urban environments sometimes correlated with higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent could provide some stability. Maybe a medium risk here.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, associated with lower recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his criminal history and lack of education. The medium factors are his age and living situation. The low factors are his size, employment, no drug use, mental health, and religious beliefs. The high factors might outweigh the others, leading me to predict a YES, but I'm not super confident because of the positive factors like employment and no drug use. So maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a range where recidivism risk is moderate, not extremely high but still significant.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"While larger individuals may have higher risk in some cases, this is not a strong indicator here.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married could indicate instability, but not a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs suggests some stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator for lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation and area\", \"medium\", \"Urban area and large household may contribute to higher risk but not significantly.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
