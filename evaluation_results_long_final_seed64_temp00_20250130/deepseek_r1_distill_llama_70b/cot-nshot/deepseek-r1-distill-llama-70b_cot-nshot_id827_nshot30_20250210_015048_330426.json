    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those with multiple arrests, seem to have a higher risk. But I'm not sure how much weight age alone holds.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. That's a lot. In the examples, higher arrest numbers, especially with convictions, often led to a \"YES\" outcome. So this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor. Maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living alone didn't seem to be a major factor in the examples, but being unmarried might be a minor point, but I'm not sure. Maybe low or medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. In the examples, lack of education was a risk, so this is probably medium to high. Since he's not enrolled in college either, that might compound the issue.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor. Maybe medium.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, was a significant factor in many examples leading to \"YES\". So high risk here.\n\nNo depression reported. That might lower the risk a bit, but not sure how much it offsets other factors.\n\nLiving in a household of size 3 as a young child. Household size didn't seem to be a major factor in the examples, so maybe low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, but not always. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions, lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use are strong indicators. Despite some protective factors like no depression and religious beliefs, the overall risk seems high. So I'm leaning towards predicting \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old is a young age, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not as significant as other factors.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"10 arrests indicate a significant history of criminal activity, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests that the arrests led to serious legal consequences, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate is a known risk factor for recidivism as it limits employment opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only 1 job in the past year suggests instability, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of substance abuse, which correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may suggest some level of social support, which could be protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No reported feelings of depression in the past month may reduce the risk compared to those experiencing mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 3 as a child is not a significant risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide some protective effects, though this can vary widely among individuals.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
