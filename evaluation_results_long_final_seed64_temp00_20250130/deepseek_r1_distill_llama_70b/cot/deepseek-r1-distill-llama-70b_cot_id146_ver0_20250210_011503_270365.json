    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction indicate some level of involvement with the criminal justice system. However, it's not an extensive history, so I might rate this as medium. If she had more arrests or convictions, it would be high.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not being married and living alone could be a medium risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can provide opportunities and stability. Not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which might lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of criminal activity. Five jobs in a year is a lot, so I'll rate this as high.\n\nShe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she's not currently depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in a household of size three. A smaller household might mean less supervision or support, but it's not as significant as other factors. I'll consider this low.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor, hence low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are job instability and drug use. Medium factors include age, criminal history, living alone, education, and employment history. The rest are low. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some protective elements like her education and religious beliefs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Holding five jobs in one year suggests instability, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use, especially with cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression, which is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size three is not particularly indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
