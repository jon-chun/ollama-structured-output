    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'll mark age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests might not be extremely high, but having a conviction does indicate some level of involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it's not a very high number of arrests, but the conviction shows that the offenses were serious enough.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 165 lbs. That's average build, maybe a bit on the leaner side. I don't think this has much bearing on criminal behavior, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but not being married at 21 isn't unusual. I'll rate this as medium because the lack of a stable family structure could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. A GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially leading to higher risk. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of criminal activity. So, medium risk here.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to further criminal behavior, either through drug-related crimes or impaired judgment. I'll rate this as high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not experiencing depression now, this might lower his risk. So, low risk here.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Having both parents is a protective factor, but urban environments might expose him to higher crime rates. I'll consider this a medium risk because the urban setting could be a negative influence despite the stable family background.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might increase risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and drug use. Medium factors include conviction history, living alone, education, employment, family environment, and religious beliefs. Low factors are his build and current mental health. The presence of two high-risk factors and several medium ones makes me lean towards predicting a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, considering some protective factors like living with both parents and having a GED, I'm about 75% confident in this prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate some involvement with the law, but not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk related to mental health.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing might expose to higher crime, despite stable family.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
