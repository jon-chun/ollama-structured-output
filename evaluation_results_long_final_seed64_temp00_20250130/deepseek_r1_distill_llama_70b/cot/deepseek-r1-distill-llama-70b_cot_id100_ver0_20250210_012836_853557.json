    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old individual to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while youth can correlate with higher recidivism, it's not the highest on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested nine times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, especially by the age of 19. This indicates a pattern of behavior that's concerning. High frequency of arrests usually points to a higher likelihood of reoffending, so I'd rate this as a high risk factor.\n\nHis demographic information includes being American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. Unfortunately, systemic issues might contribute to higher recidivism rates in some communities, so this could be a medium risk factor due to potential environmental and societal challenges.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 180 lbs. While this doesn't directly indicate a risk, being of average build doesn't necessarily lower the risk either. I might consider this a low risk factor since physical build alone isn't a strong predictor.\n\nLiving alone and never being married suggests a lack of stable social support. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more at risk for recidivism. This seems like a medium risk factor because social isolation can contribute to reoffending.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college points to limited educational attainment. Education often provides opportunities and stability, so the lack of it can increase recidivism risk. This is a high risk factor because education is a key factor in rehabilitation and employment opportunities.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without a steady income, individuals might resort to criminal activities out of necessity or due to idle time. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is less severe than other drugs, any drug use can be a risk factor. However, since it's not indicated as a current problem, I might rate this as medium. If there were signs of heavier drug use, it would be higher.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might lower the risk a bit. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of eight could indicate a stressful or unstable environment. Large family sizes can sometimes correlate with higher delinquency due to less individual attention and resources. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, acting as a protective factor. So, this might be a low risk factor as it could help in rehabilitation.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his arrest history, lack of education, and unemployment. Medium factors include his age, ethnicity, living situation, drug use, and upbringing. Low factors are his build, mental health, and spirituality. The combination of multiple high and medium factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. Therefore, the prediction is YES, and considering the number of high-risk elements, my confidence is around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"arrest frequency\", \"high\", \"Nine arrests by age 19 indicates a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Systemic issues may contribute to higher recidivism in some communities.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone suggests limited social support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED limits opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use could indicate substance-related issues.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Large household may have contributed to unstable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Beliefs may provide support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
