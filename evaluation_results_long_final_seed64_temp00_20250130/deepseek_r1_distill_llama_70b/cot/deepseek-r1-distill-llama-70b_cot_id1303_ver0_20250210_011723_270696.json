    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests show some criminal involvement, but it's not an extensive history. However, having a conviction does indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 200-224 lbs. While being physically larger might be a factor in certain crimes, it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but not being married at 18 is common. This seems like a medium risk factor because the lack of a stable family environment can contribute to recidivism.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college points to limited education. Education is a strong predictor; lower education often correlates with higher recidivism. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. I'll rate this as medium because frequent job changes might suggest instability but not necessarily a high risk on its own.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it's not as strong a predictor as harder drugs. I'll consider this a low risk factor since it's less severe.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this might lower his risk. So, low risk here.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might influence behavior. This is a medium risk factor because the environment can play a role, but it's not the strongest indicator.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a support system and moral framework. So this might lower his risk, making it a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age and lack of education. Medium factors include criminal history, living situation, and job instability. Low factors are physical build, drug use, mental health, and religious beliefs. The high and medium factors suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest, so I'll predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal involvement, but it's not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism as it limits opportunities and social integration.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is less strongly associated with recidivism compared to other substances.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk compared to individuals with active mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a biological mother in a small household may present environmental challenges.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
