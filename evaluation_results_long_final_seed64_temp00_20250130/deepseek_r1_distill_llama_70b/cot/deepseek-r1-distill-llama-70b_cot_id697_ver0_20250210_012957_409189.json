    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and might not have as much life stability. So I'm thinking age is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, which suggests a pattern of criminal behavior. Multiple arrests, especially leading to a conviction, are strong indicators of a higher likelihood of reoffending. So I would rate prior criminal history as high.\n\nHis living situation is alone, and he's never been married. Living alone might indicate a lack of stable family support, which can be a risk factor. Not being married could mean less social integration and stability, so I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment and lack of education are both linked to higher recidivism rates. Without a steady job, he might resort to criminal activities out of necessity or boredom. So education and employment status are high risk factors.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a well-known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities to support the habit. So substance abuse is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is a low risk factor because mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior. Since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might lower his risk in that area.\n\nHis upbringing was with adults other than biological parents in a small household in a rural area. Unstable family environments can increase recidivism risk, but since it's a small household, maybe the impact is less. I'm not too sure about this one, but I'll rate family environment as medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but in this case, it might indicate a lack of social or moral support structures. I'm not certain, but I'll consider it a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like prior criminal history, unemployment, substance abuse, and medium factors like age and living situation. This makes me lean towards predicting a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because most factors point towards a higher risk, but there are a couple of lower factors that might reduce it a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism, but not the highest.\"),\n    (\"prior_criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Six arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate instability, but not as high risk as other factors.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"high\", \"Having a GED but no current job increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk from mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable upbringing could contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce protective factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
