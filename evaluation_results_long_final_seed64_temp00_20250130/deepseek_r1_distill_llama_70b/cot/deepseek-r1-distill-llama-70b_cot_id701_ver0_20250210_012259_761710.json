    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more prone to impulsive decisions. However, she's not a juvenile anymore, so maybe the risk isn't as high as it could be. I'll mark age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males. That makes me think gender is a low risk factor here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction. It could mean she was arrested but not found guilty, which might lower the risk. So, criminal history is low.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that doesn't seem to contribute much to the risk. Physical build is probably a low factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate some instability or less social support, which could be a risk. However, not being married at 20 isn't unusual. I'll consider living situation as medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor, so having a diploma is good. Not being in college might limit her opportunities, but it's not a strong indicator. Education is low risk.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. High job turnover might suggest she's struggling, so employment history is medium.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor. However, since it's not a harder drug, maybe the risk isn't as high. I'll rate substance use as medium.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she's not currently depressed, this might be a lower risk. Mental health is low.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so family background is low.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has control over her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider religious beliefs as low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The medium factors like age, living situation, job instability, and substance use are present but not overly alarming. Since there's no conviction and she has a stable upbringing, I think the overall prediction is NO for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are some risks, they aren't overwhelming.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, but being an adult can also indicate some level of stability.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not indicate heightened risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not being in college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Four jobs in a year could indicate instability, a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than harder drugs but still a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may not be a significant risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
