    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's on the lower end of that risk since she's not a juvenile anymore. So I'll mark age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement or perhaps a first-time offense that didn't lead to a guilty verdict. This could lower her risk, so I'll consider this a low factor.\n\nHer living situation is alone, which might mean less supervision or support. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there's a lack of social support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment and lack of education can be risk factors because they might lead to idle time or financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so her abstinence is a positive sign. Mental health issues can also play a role, but since she's not feeling depressed, this lowers her risk. I'll mark both substance abuse and mental health as low.\n\nHer upbringing was with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally a stable factor. This might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life. While some studies suggest religious involvement can reduce recidivism, the absence of it isn't necessarily a high risk. I'll consider this a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most of her factors are low or medium. The lack of substance abuse and mental health issues are strong positives. While unemployment and living alone are concerns, they aren't as significant without other high-risk factors. So, I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less supervision or support.\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment and lack of higher education can lead to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression lowers this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in urban area is relatively stable.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence isn't a significant risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
