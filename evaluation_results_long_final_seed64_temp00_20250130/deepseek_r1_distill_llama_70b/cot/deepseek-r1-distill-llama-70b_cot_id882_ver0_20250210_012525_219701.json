    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate a lower risk compared to someone with a conviction, but it still shows some involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't immediately stand out as significant risk factors. Unless there's a specific reason related to his size that's relevant, I don't see this as a major contributor. So, I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision or support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. On the other hand, it could also mean more independence. I'm leaning towards medium risk here because living alone can have both positive and negative influences.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities, which could be a risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held one job in the past year. Stable employment is a strong protective factor, so having at least one job suggests some stability. This seems like a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years, is a concern. Substance use can increase the likelihood of recidivism, especially if it's a habit. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a protective factor. This is low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household as a child is a strong protective factor. It suggests a supportive environment, which reduces the risk of recidivism. So, this is low.\n\nHis religious views, or lack thereof, don't have a strong correlation with recidivism. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can be protective, but it's not a major factor here. I'll consider this low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his age and perhaps living alone. Medium factors include prior arrest, education, and drug use. The rest are low. Overall, I think the risk is medium, but considering the factors, I might lean towards a prediction of YES with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Less supervision or support may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma is protective, but not pursuing further education could limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder drugs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
