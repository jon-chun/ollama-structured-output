    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors. So, I think age is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests at a young age, indicating a pattern of behavior that could continue. This seems like a high risk factor because frequent arrests often correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. It doesn't really influence criminal behavior, so that's low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'll mark that as medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs. Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and fewer opportunities, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. That's a high risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a well-known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities. So, that's high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she's not currently depressed, this might lower her risk a bit. I'll consider this a low factor.\n\nHer upbringing with adoptive parents in a rural area with a household of five might have provided some stability, but rural areas sometimes have less access to resources. However, without more info, I'm not sure how big an impact this has. Maybe medium.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has control over her life. Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can reduce recidivism by providing a support system and moral framework. So, the lack of religious influence might be a medium risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, she has several high-risk factors like prior convictions, unemployment, and substance abuse. These likely outweigh the lower factors. So, I predict she will be rearrested, with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 18 years old, she is in a high-risk age group for impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Five arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to increased likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but no college enrollment is a moderate risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
