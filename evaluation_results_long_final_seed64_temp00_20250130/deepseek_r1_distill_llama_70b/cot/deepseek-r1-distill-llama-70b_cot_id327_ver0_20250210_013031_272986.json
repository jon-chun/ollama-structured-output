    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because she's at an age where decision-making isn't fully matured yet.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low because it's a single arrest without a conviction history.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'0\" and 140 lbs. I don't think physical build is a significant factor here, so this is probably low.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Being unmarried at 18 is normal, and living with others might actually provide more support, so this seems low risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and is linked to higher recidivism, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher recidivism. This seems medium risk.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common but can be a risk factor. However, since it's not specified as heavy use, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed, so this is a medium factor.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with both parents is usually a stabilizing factor. The large household size could be stressful, so I'll consider this medium.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from education, medium from job instability, mental health, and living situation, and some lows. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity and less life stability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, lowering the risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"medium\", \"Four jobs in a year indicates instability, which can correlate with higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can still contribute to risk if linked to other factors.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase vulnerability to reoffending if untreated.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large urban household might expose her to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
