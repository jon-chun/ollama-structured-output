    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more influenced by peer pressure or impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Having a prior record, especially multiple arrests, is a significant risk factor. It indicates a pattern of behavior that could continue, so this is probably a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Unless there's something specific about his physical appearance that's linked to criminal behavior, which I don't think is the case, so I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence recidivism. Being single and living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. I'd rate this as medium risk.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school. Education is a protective factor because it provides structure, keeps him occupied, and can lead to better opportunities, reducing the need to engage in criminal activities. So this is a low-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Without a steady income, individuals might resort to illegal activities out of necessity or boredom. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and association with criminal circles. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean he's in a better mental state, but the drug use is still concerning. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family background is a protective factor, but urban environments might expose him to higher crime rates and influences. This could be a medium-risk factor, but since he did live with both parents, maybe it's lower. Hmm, maybe medium.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So this is a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his prior convictions and unemployment. Medium risks include living alone, drug use, and urban upbringing. Low risks are his education, religious beliefs, and physical build. The protective factors like education and religion might lower his overall risk, but the high-risk factors are significant. So I'm leaning towards a medium confidence that he might reoffend, but I'm not extremely confident. Maybe around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that may continue.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support might increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"No steady income can lead to engaging in illegal activities out of necessity or boredom.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Substance abuse can impair judgment and associate with criminal circles.\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments might expose to higher crime rates and influences.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Provides structure and opportunities, reducing criminal engagement.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Sense of purpose and community can act as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
