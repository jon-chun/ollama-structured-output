    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's female. I remember that, on average, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males. So her gender might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction could indicate a lower risk since it didn't result in a guilty verdict. However, the fact that she was arrested at all might still be a factor. I'm leaning towards low here because it's a single arrest without a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to recidivism. Unless there's something specific about her physical appearance that's a risk, which I don't see here, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence support systems. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a medium risk factor. However, not being married at 20 isn't unusual, so maybe it's more on the lower side.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could be a low to medium risk. I'll say low because she does have a diploma.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability can be a risk factor. Frequent job changes might indicate instability or issues with employment, which could increase the likelihood of recidivism. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a common factor in recidivism. It's not as severe as harder drugs, but it's still a risk. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor because untreated mental health can lead to poor decision-making.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is a stable factor. This might be a low risk.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a support system and moral framework. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are a mix of low, medium, and one high. The high is from job instability, which stands out. However, she has protective factors like education and religious beliefs. Overall, I think the prediction is NO, meaning lower risk, with a confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not significant risk factors.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 20 is common and not a high risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a common risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent is stable.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religion can be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
