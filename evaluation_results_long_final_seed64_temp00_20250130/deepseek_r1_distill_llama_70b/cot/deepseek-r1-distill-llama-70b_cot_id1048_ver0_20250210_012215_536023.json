    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Hispanic male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. A higher number of prior arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses. This definitely points to a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. It doesn't really influence criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and stable relationships can be stabilizing factors, so not being married and living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which could increase the risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can provide structure and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So, this is a low-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. Recent use, even if occasional, still poses a risk, so I'll rate this as high.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Depression or other mental health problems can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed. This is a medium-risk factor.\n\nHis upbringing in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four might not be a significant factor on its own, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates and less resources, so I'll consider this a medium-risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might increase risk, but this can vary. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his age, prior arrests/convictions, unemployment, and drug use. Medium factors include living alone, mental health, and upbringing. Low factors are his physical build, education, and religious views. The high-risk factors are significant, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 80% because while the factors are strong, there's still a chance for intervention, especially with his current enrollment in school.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly influence criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Current enrollment in school provides structure and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increase criminal activity risk.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing/environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have higher crime rates and fewer resources.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
