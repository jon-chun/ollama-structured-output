    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age for potential recidivism.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it does show some involvement with the law. I'd rate this as medium because it's a factor, but not the most severe.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 150-174 lbs. While physical build can sometimes be a factor in certain crimes, it's not a strong indicator on its own. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living situation can sometimes indicate stability. Not being married at 20 isn't unusual, but living with others might provide some support, so maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and possibly increase the likelihood of reoffending. This seems like a high risk factor because unemployment is a known contributor to recidivism.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to relapse into criminal behavior. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down in dumps some of the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor because it's a concern but maybe not as severe as others.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a rural area as a child. Rural areas might have less access to resources, but living with a biological parent is generally positive. This might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'd rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are unemployment/education and drug use. Medium factors include age, mental health, and criminal history. Low factors are the rest. So, the prediction is YES for rearrest, and I'm about 80% confident because the high factors are strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is within a high-risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment and lack of job history are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially cocaine, significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may provide some stability and support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, though not enrolled in college.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a rural area is relatively stable.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation has some correlation but is not a strong factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
