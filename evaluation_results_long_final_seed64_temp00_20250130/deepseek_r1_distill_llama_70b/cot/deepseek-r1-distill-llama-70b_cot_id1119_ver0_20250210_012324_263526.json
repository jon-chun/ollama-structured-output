    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old Black male who's been arrested six times but not convicted. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are often associated with higher recidivism rates because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack of stability. So, I'd consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times without a conviction. The number of arrests is a red flag because it indicates frequent interactions with the law, even if he hasn't been convicted. This suggests a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. So, I'm leaning towards high risk here.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'2\" and 140 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height. Maybe he's dealing with health issues or substance abuse, which could contribute to risky behaviors. I'm not sure how significant this is, but it might tie into other factors like drug use, so I'll mark it as low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which is a risk factor for recidivism. Marriage and family ties often provide stability, so not having that might increase his risk. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it limits job opportunities, which can lead to criminal activity out of necessity or boredom. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without a steady income, he might resort to illegal activities. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use is a big one. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used them all the time in the past month. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and illegal activities to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down for the past month. Depression or mental health issues can increase the likelihood of substance abuse and criminal behavior. This is another high risk factor.\n\nLiving in a household of size four at a young age. Larger family size might indicate less individual attention or resources, which can contribute to behavioral issues. I'm not sure how significant this is, but it might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, but it depends on how actively he's involved. Since it's just a belief without mention of active participation, I'll consider it a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors: prior arrests, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and mental health issues. These outweigh the lower risk factors. So, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest, with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not excessively high risk.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests\", \"high\", \"6 arrests without conviction indicate a pattern of problematic behavior that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity due to lack of stable income.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"Recent and frequent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism and ongoing behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Depression can contribute to poor decision-making and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living in a larger household at a young age may have contributed to instability but is not a strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide some protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
