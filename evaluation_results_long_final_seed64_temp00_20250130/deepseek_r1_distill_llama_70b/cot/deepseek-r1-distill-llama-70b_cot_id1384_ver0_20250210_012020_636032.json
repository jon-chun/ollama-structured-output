    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to a conviction. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that might continue. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHer marital status is married and living with her spouse. Being in a stable relationship can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and stability, which might reduce the likelihood of reoffending. So I'd consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher stress and potentially more involvement in criminal activities. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which might increase the risk of recidivism. So, medium risk here as well.\n\nShe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's experienced depression, feeling down for parts of the past month. Mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism if not properly addressed, as they might lead to self-medication or other risky behaviors. So, medium risk.\n\nShe grew up in a rural area with her biological mother in a small household. Rural areas might have fewer resources and opportunities, which could contribute to higher risk, but the small household size might have provided more individual attention. I'm not sure, but I'll lean towards low risk here.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Spiritual beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, which might reduce the risk of recidivism. So, low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a big concern, but she has some protective factors like being married and having spiritual beliefs. The other factors are medium or low. So, I think the overall prediction is that she might reoffend, but I'm not super confident. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral patterns, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism due to potential impaired judgment and criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if not properly addressed, potentially leading to self-medication.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a small household may provide some stability, though rural areas have fewer resources.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide moral framework and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
