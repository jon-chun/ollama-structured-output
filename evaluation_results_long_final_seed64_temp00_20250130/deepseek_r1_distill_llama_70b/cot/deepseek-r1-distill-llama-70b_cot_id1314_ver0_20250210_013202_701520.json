    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where charges didn't stick, or perhaps he's had close calls. This could suggest some involvement in risky behavior, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 170 lbs. That's a bit on the taller and leaner side, but I don't see how that directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in certain contexts, but overall, I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, which could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor. Having unstable or minimal employment can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed. Both are positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors, so their absence lowers the risk. I'll rate both as low.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size five. Larger households might have more stress or less individual attention, which could be a risk, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider this low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the medium factors are age, arrests without convictions, living alone, and employment instability. The rest are low. The presence of multiple medium factors suggests a moderate risk, but the protective factors like education, no drug use, and religious beliefs might mitigate this. So I'm leaning towards a prediction of \"NO\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and less life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without convictions\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests without convictions may indicate risky behavior or close calls with the law.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate less social support, which may increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a larger household may have stressors but is not a strong risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
