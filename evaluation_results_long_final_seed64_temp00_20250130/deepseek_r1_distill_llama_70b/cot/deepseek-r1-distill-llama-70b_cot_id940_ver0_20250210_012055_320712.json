    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might indicate a lower likelihood of reoffending, so that's low.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here, so I'll note that as low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk, but she's also in an urban area and has a stable living situation from a young age, so maybe that's medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which is a positive factor for stability and lower recidivism. That's low risk.\n\nHaving held one job in the past year suggests some employment stability, which is good, so that's low.\n\nDrug use, specifically cocaine in the past four years, is a significant risk factor. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism, so that's high.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign, so low risk there.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household as a child is a protective factor, lowering risk, so that's low.\n\nHer religious beliefs might provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so that's low.\n\nPutting it all together, the main high risk factor is drug use, but she has several protective factors like education and stable upbringing. So I'm leaning towards a lower overall prediction of rearrest, but with medium confidence because of that one high factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held a job suggests some level of stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
