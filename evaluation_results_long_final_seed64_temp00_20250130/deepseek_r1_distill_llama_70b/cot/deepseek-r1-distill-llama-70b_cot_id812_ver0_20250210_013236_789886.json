    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'm thinking age is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it still indicates some involvement with the law. So I'll mark criminal history as low.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to pose an unusual risk. That's a low factor.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk, but he's also in college, which is a positive factor. So I'm leaning towards medium for living situation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor, so this is a low risk.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held two jobs, which indicates some stability, so low risk there.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. Both are positive signs, so substance abuse and mental health are low risks.\n\nHis living situation as a child with non-biological adults might have some impact, but it's not a strong indicator, so medium.\n\nReligious beliefs can provide a support system, so that's a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. His positive education and employment status are strong positives. So I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest and conviction may indicate some risk, but it is not indicative of a high recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not typically correlate with increased criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs in the past year indicates some level of stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator for low recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression suggest better mental health, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults at a young age may have some impact on stability.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
