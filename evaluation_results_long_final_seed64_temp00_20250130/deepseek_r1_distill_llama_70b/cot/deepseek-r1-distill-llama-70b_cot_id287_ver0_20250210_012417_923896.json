    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some level of criminal involvement, but since it's only one arrest, it's not a very extensive history. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that doesn't seem to pose any particular risk. I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk, but not being married at 18 is pretty common. I'm not sure how significant this is, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor because it provides stability and opportunities. This should lower his risk, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism by providing income and structure. Having two jobs might indicate some instability, but overall, it's a positive sign. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor for recidivism. However, since it's not a harder drug, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good because mental health issues can increase recidivism risk. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but the family support likely mitigates that.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can provide a sense of purpose and support, reducing recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has some high-risk factors like his age and a few medium ones, but several protective factors as well. I think the prediction is more towards not being rearrested, so \"NO\". My confidence is around 65% because while there are positive signs, the high-risk factors still pose some uncertainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and conviction indicates some criminal history but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not pose a specific risk factor.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs suggests some stability, though frequent job changes could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
