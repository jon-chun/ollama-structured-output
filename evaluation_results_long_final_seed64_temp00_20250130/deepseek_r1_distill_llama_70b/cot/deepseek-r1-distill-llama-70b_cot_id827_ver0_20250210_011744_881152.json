    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times already. That's a significant number, especially by the age of 18. Frequent arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that's not changing, which is a strong indicator for high recidivism risk. So, arrest frequency is high.\n\nHe has been convicted, which means he's had contact with the criminal justice system beyond just arrests. A conviction often leads to more severe consequences, which might not deter someone already entrenched in criminal behavior. So, prior conviction is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Unless there's something specific about his physical appearance that's linked to criminal behavior, which I don't see, this factor is probably low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living situation can be stabilizing factors. Not being married and living with others might indicate less stability or support, which could increase the risk. So, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college points to lower educational attainment. Education is a known protective factor against recidivism. Without it, job prospects are limited, which can lead to continued criminal activity. So, education is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Employment is another protective factor. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. So, employment history is a medium-risk factor.\n\nDrug use, especially with marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, is a significant risk factor. Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior and recidivism. So, drug use is high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might lower the risk a bit. So, mental health is low.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size three. Larger family sizes can sometimes be associated with more support, but smaller households might have less supervision. However, without more context, this isn't a strong indicator. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective against recidivism. So, this is a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are age, arrest frequency, conviction, education, and drug use. Medium factors are living situation and employment. Low factors are physical build, mental health, family size, and religious beliefs. The high-risk factors dominate, so the prediction is YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while the risk factors are strong, there's always some uncertainty in individual cases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrest frequency\", \"high\", \"10 arrests by age 18 indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"high\", \"A conviction suggests more severe criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No specific risk indicated by height and weight.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable living conditions may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family size\", \"low\", \"Household size alone isn't a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide protective support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
