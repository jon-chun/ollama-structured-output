    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but not necessarily guilty, or perhaps he's had close calls. Without convictions, the direct risk isn't as high, but the fact that he's been arrested multiple times could suggest some involvement in risky behavior. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 175-199 lbs. This is pretty average, so I don't see this as a significant risk factor. Maybe in some contexts, physical size could matter, but alone, it's not a strong indicator. So low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and social support, which are protective factors. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, so this could slightly increase risk. I'll mark this as low to medium, but leaning towards low because it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, which could increase the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior. So this is a low risk factor because he does have a diploma, but the lack of further education is a minor concern.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor. However, having multiple jobs in a short time might indicate instability, which could be a risk. But overall, being employed is positive, so I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a big protective factor. Substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism, so not using drugs lowers his risk significantly. This is definitely a low risk factor.\n\nNo recent depression is another positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so being mentally stable is a good sign. Low risk here.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a large household as a child. Stable family environments are protective. A household size of five might mean more support, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk. The main concerns are his age and prior arrests, but without convictions, the risk isn't too high. Employment and education are positives. So I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential risky behavior, though lack of convictions may indicate lesser direct risk.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective, though not pursuing further education could limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is protective, though frequent job changes might indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years significantly lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk factors associated with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with biological mother is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
