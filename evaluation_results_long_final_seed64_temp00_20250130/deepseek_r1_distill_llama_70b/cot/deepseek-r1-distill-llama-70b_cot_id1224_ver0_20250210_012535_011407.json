    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This suggests he might have ongoing issues with the law, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. It doesn't really contribute to recidivism, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk, but it's not as significant as other factors. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can provide structure and reduce idle time, which is a protective factor. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to idle time and financial instability, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is good. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, but since he's abstained, this is a low risk.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nHe believes in God, which can provide emotional support and structure, another protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, prior arrests/convictions, and unemployment. The medium factors are current mental state and living alone. The low factors are the rest. The high factors are significant, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 80% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some protective elements like education and stable upbringing that might mitigate the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests/convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and idle time.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents provides stability.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide emotional support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
