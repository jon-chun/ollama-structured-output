    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old Hispanic female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is on its own. Maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but maybe the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, so I'd say medium risk here too.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'0\" and 145 lbs. I don't think physical build is a strong indicator for recidivism. People of all sizes can commit crimes, so this seems low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Not being married at a young age isn't necessarily bad, but combined with living alone, it might contribute to isolation. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and possibly more opportunities to engage in criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor because unemployment is a known predictor of recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. Drug use is a major risk factor, so her abstinence lowers her risk here. That's a low risk.\n\nShe's been feeling down most of the past month. Depression can lead to poor decision-making and might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Mental health issues can be a significant risk, so I'll rate this as high.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household of five. A stable family background is a protective factor, which lowers her risk. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but the family support might mitigate that. I'll consider this a low risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism. Religious beliefs often act as a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, she has some high-risk factors like unemployment and mental health issues, but also protective factors like stable upbringing and religious beliefs. The prediction is a bit uncertain, but I think she's more likely to not be rearrested because of the positive factors. My confidence is around 65% because there are conflicting factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential risky behavior, though lack of convictions may indicate lesser severity.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between physical build and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, a potential risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment and education can lead to increased opportunities for criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs reduces this significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Depression can impair decision-making and increase risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
