    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement, but it's still a risk factor. I think this is medium because it shows some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe as a prior conviction.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase the risk of reoffending. So I'll rate living situation as medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can lead to higher recidivism. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. So employment history is medium.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years, is a concern. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nFeeling down in the past month could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated, can increase recidivism risk. So mental health is medium.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents at a young age might indicate instability in her upbringing, which can be a risk factor. Household instability is medium.\n\nComing from an urban area might expose her to higher crime environments, so urban residence is medium.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has a role in her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but in this context, it might not be as significant, so I'll consider it low.\n\nPutting it all together, she has several medium and one high risk factor. The high risk factor is education, which is a strong predictor. However, she doesn't have a conviction, which is a positive. I think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because some factors are mitigating. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the law but not a strong pattern.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong support system, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism, though not as severe as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"household_instability\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents at a young age may indicate unstable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"urban_residence\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may expose individuals to higher crime rates and influences.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may not be a significant protective factor in this context.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
