    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while she's not a juvenile anymore, her age might still contribute to higher risk behavior compared to older individuals.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low because the absence of a conviction suggests it might not be a strong indicator of future criminal behavior.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 125-149 lbs. Physical build isn't typically a strong indicator for recidivism, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Not being married isn't a big risk, but living with others might provide some support, so maybe low risk here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could be a medium risk.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate instability. This could be a medium risk factor because job instability is linked to higher recidivism.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as it's often linked to criminal behavior. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so not feeling depressed is a low risk.\n\nHer living situation as a child with non-biological adults in an urban area could indicate instability or exposure to higher-risk environments. This might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'll rate this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use and medium risks from age, education, employment, and upbringing make me lean towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, the absence of conviction and some protective factors like education might lower the confidence a bit. So, I'll predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight are not significant predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not being married is not a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job suggests instability, which can contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially with substances like cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults in an urban area may indicate exposure to higher-risk environments.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may slightly increase risk but is not a strong factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
