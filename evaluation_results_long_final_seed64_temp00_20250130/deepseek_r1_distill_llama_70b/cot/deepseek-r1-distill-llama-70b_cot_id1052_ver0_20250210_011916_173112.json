    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age where decision-making isn't fully matured.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low because it's a single incident without a formal record.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 199 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but I don't see how that directly relates to criminal behavior. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, this isn't a strong indicator. So, low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. However, not being married at 20 isn't unusual, so I'm leaning towards medium risk for living situation.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which ties back to the lack of education. Unstable employment is a medium risk factor because it can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common, but it can still be a risk factor depending on frequency and impact on behavior. I'd rate this as medium since it's not a hard drug, but any drug use can impair judgment.\n\nNo feelings of depression in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this might actually be a protective factor. So, low risk here.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five when young. Growing up in a larger household might mean less individual attention, but having a biological parent present is generally positive. This seems low risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, which is a protective factor. So, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is the lack of education, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors include age, living situation, unstable employment, and drug use. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are some protective factors like religious beliefs and no recent mental health issues. So, I'll set confidence at 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests some risk but is not as significant as a conviction.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"high\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED can limit employment opportunities and increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unstable employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in one year may indicate instability, which can contribute to financial stress and increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while common, can still impair judgment and increase the likelihood of risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression suggest better mental health, which can be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent in a larger household suggests a stable upbringing, which can be a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in a higher power can provide a moral framework and support system, reducing the risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
