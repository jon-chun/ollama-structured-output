    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's significant. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. So this seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can provide stability, but not pursuing higher education might limit job opportunities, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the risk of recidivism. So this is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if it's recent, can be a risk factor. However, since it's only marijuana and there's no mention of harder drugs, I might rate this as medium.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently feeling depressed, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his criminal history and maybe his employment stability. The protective factors like marriage, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs might lower the overall risk. I'm leaning towards predicting \"NO\" for rearrest, but I'm about 65% confident because there are some significant risk factors like his criminal history and limited employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse can provide stability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not attending college may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held only one job in the past year, indicating possible instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years could indicate substance issues.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, which is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
