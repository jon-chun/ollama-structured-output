    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while he's not a juvenile anymore, he's still relatively young.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, showing a pattern of behavior. Recidivism is more likely with a higher number of prior arrests, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 200-224 lbs. While this might make him stand out, there's no direct correlation between physical size and criminal behavior, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of stable family support, which can be a risk factor. However, not being married at 20 isn't unusual, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but having a diploma is positive. Not attending college might limit his opportunities, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can stabilize someone, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is protective, so this is low. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but the stable family mitigates that, so overall low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a mix of high, medium, and low factors. The high number of arrests and convictions are concerning, but he has some protective factors like education and religious beliefs. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because of the mitigating factors. Maybe around 72% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 20 years old, he is in a high-risk age group for recidivism, but not exceptionally so.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests a pattern of illegal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs suggests some stability but also potential instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than other drugs but still a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
