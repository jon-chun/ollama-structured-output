    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So, I'd consider her age as a medium risk factor because while it's not the highest, it's still a significant factor.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions can indicate either that she's been in situations where she's at risk, or perhaps she's had close calls. Multiple arrests might suggest a pattern, so I'm leaning towards medium risk here as well.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't see any indication that her physical build would contribute to recidivism, so that's low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which could be a risk. However, not being married at 18 is pretty common, so maybe that's a low factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to poverty, which might drive criminal behavior. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which is another risk factor. So, I'd rate this as medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so her abstinence lowers her risk here. That's a low factor.\n\nLiving in a household of six at a young age. Growing up in a crowded household might indicate socioeconomic challenges or lack of supervision, which can increase risk. I'd say medium here.\n\nShe believes God influences her personally. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism. So, this is a protective factor, making it a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, she has some significant risk factors like lack of education and unstable employment, but also protective factors like no drug use and religious beliefs. I think the prediction is still YES because the high and medium factors might outweigh the low ones, but my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Being 18 years old is considered a medium risk factor as younger individuals are more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Three arrests without conviction suggest potential risky behavior or exposure to risky situations.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 18 is common and doesn't strongly indicate a lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED limits job opportunities and is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unstable employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job in a year indicates financial instability, a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no drug use\", \"low\", \"Abstinence from drugs is a positive sign reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household may indicate socioeconomic challenges.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
