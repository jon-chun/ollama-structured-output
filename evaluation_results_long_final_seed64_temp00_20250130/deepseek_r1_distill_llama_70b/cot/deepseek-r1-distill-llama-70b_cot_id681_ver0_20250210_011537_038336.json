    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it does show some involvement with the criminal justice system. I'd rate this as medium because it's a prior offense, but not a repeated pattern yet.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and between 225-249 lbs. While this might make him stand out, by itself, it's not a strong indicator of criminal behavior. So, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living situation can sometimes indicate stability. Not being married isn't a big deal at 22, but living with others might provide some support, so maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, which could be a medium risk factor as it might lead to unemployment or low-income situations that can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor because steady employment often reduces the likelihood of reoffending. Having only one job might indicate some instability, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities to support a habit. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family background is a protective factor, so this would be low. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but the family support might mitigate that.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, which is a protective factor. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors include age, prior conviction, limited education, and job instability. The low factors are his physical build, living situation, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high drug use and several medium factors might tip the prediction towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, the presence of protective factors like family and religious beliefs might lower the confidence a bit. So, I'm predicting YES with a confidence around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some criminal history but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight alone are not strong indicators of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being unmarried at 22 is common and not indicative of risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests some instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, which could lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents provides stability.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
