    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or less stable life circumstances. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that she's had some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor because the absence of a conviction might mean the offense wasn't too serious or she's still early in her potential criminal behavior.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. Physical build isn't typically a strong indicator for recidivism, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 21 is pretty common. I'm not sure how much this contributes, so maybe low risk here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being in college suggests she's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, which should lower her risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or idleness, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal activity, either through drug-seeking behavior or being in environments where crimes occur. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she's not feeling depressed now, that's a good sign. So this is low.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Living in an urban environment might expose her to higher crime rates and more opportunities for criminal activity, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community, which can reduce the likelihood of recidivism. So this is low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors are age, unemployment, and urban upbringing. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the overall prediction is that she might reoffend, so prediction is YES. My confidence is around 65% because while there are some concerning factors like drug use and unemployment, she also has protective factors like education and religious beliefs that might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being unmarried at 21 is common and not a strong risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in college is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increased risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose to higher crime opportunities.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide protective support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
