    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Black male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some criminal history, but since it's only one arrest, it's not an extensive record. So I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant risk factor. Maybe low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate less support, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, so medium risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could mean he's struggling to maintain employment, which is a risk for recidivism. So high risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so this is low.\n\nHe's been feeling down for a month. Depression can increase recidivism risk because it might lead to poor decision-making or substance use. So high risk.\n\nHe lived with non-biological parents as a child. Unstable upbringing can increase risks, so medium.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, job instability, and depression. Medium factors include living alone, education, and upbringing. Low factors are physical build, no drug use, and religion. The high factors are significant, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest, but not certain. Confidence is around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, especially males, are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once indicates some criminal history, but it is not an extensive record.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for an extended period could indicate depression, which may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents at a young age may indicate an unstable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
