    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This suggests he might not be deterred by legal consequences, so this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low-risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and stable relationships can be stabilizing factors, so not being married and living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which could increase recidivism risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can provide structure and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. So, this is a low-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and idleness, which might drive someone to criminal activity. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower the risk a bit, but the drug use is still concerning. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nLiving in a household of size five at a young age could mean less individual attention or supervision, potentially contributing to behavioral issues. This is a medium-risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So, this is a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his age, criminal history, and unemployment. Medium factors include living situation and drug use. The protective factors are education and religious beliefs. Considering these, I think he's at a high risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school provides structure and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and idleness.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Larger households may offer less individual supervision.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
