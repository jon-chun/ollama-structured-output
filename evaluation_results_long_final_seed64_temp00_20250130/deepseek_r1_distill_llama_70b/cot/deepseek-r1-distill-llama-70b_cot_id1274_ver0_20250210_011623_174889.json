    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So, I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that he's had run-ins with the law, but the lack of convictions could mean the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. This could suggest some involvement in risky behavior, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 202 lbs. While this might make him stand out, there's no direct correlation between physical size and criminal behavior, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living alone can sometimes indicate stability, but his situation might mean he's still dependent or in a less stable living environment. However, without more context, I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a strong indicator of lower recidivism because it provides opportunities and structure. This seems like a protective factor, so I'll consider it low risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or personal issues. This could be a medium risk factor as it might show a lack of stable employment, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it can still be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. Since it's mentioned as past use, I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe lived with adoptive parents in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might increase exposure to criminal activity. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor and low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the medium risk factors are age, prior arrests, job instability, and upbringing. The low factors are physical size, living situation, education, drug use, mental health, and religion. The medium factors are more concerning but not overly so. His education and lack of convictions are positives. I think the overall prediction is that he won't be rearrested, with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests without conviction indicate potential involvement in risky behavior but lack of formal criminal history.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in a year may suggest instability, which can contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area as a child may expose individuals to higher crime rates and fewer resources.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between size and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may not significantly impact recidivism risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is common and not strongly indicative of high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No current depression reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
