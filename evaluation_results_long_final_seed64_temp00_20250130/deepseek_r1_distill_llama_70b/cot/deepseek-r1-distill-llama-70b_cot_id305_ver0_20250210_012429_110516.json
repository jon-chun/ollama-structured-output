    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more prone to impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean a few things. It might indicate that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but perhaps hasn't yet crossed the line into more serious offenses. However, multiple arrests can also suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to future legal issues.\n\nHis physical build is 5'8\" and 150-174 lbs. This is pretty average, so I don't think this is a significant risk factor either way. It doesn't particularly increase or decrease his risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might mean he doesn't have a strong support system, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and stable relationships often correlate with lower recidivism, so not being married and living alone could be a medium risk.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can provide structure, reduce idle time, and offer better opportunities, all of which can lower the risk of rearrest. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, providing income and structure. Having a job could reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and can be linked to criminal behavior to support a habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Having a stable family background with both parents can be protective against recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective factors. This is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his young age and drug use. The medium risk is living alone. The rest are low. So, considering these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are positive factors like education and employment. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral patterns without serious offense conviction.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of strong support system may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Provides structure and opportunities, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Offers stability and income, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Sense of purpose and community can reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
