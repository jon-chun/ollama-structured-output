    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more prone to impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction could indicate a lower risk since it didn't result in a guilty verdict, but it still shows some involvement with the law, which is a concern.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor here. Physical build isn't a strong indicator of recidivism unless it's extreme, which it isn't in this case.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability, but being single and living alone at 18 is pretty common and not necessarily a high-risk factor. It might suggest less social support, but not definitively.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being enrolled in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities and has access to resources that can help him stay on track, which lowers his risk.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate some instability or limited work history, which could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common but can still be a risk factor. It might impair judgment and lead to further legal issues, though it's not as severe as harder drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area with a household size of five. Living in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates, but having a stable family structure with his biological parent is a protective factor. A larger household might mean more support, but it could also lead to less individual attention.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means less community support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are his young age and marijuana use. However, his educational enrollment and stable family background are positive. The prior arrest is a concern but not as severe without a conviction. Employment history is a bit shaky but not a major issue. Overall, I think the risk is on the lower side, so I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but not a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college, indicating engagement in positive activities and access to resources.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having one job suggests some instability or limited work history.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can impair judgment and lead to legal issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family structure with biological parent is protective.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common at 18 and not a significant risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
