    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more influenced by peer pressure or impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior. The more interactions someone has with the criminal justice system, the higher the likelihood they might reoffend, especially if they haven't had interventions or support to change their behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 215 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, physical size alone isn't a direct risk factor for recidivism. It could be a factor in certain contexts, like violent crimes, but without knowing the nature of his previous arrests, it's hard to weigh this factor too heavily. I might consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence recidivism. Being single and living alone might mean less social support, which can increase the risk of reoffending. However, this isn't as strong a predictor as other factors like employment or substance use, so I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his job opportunities, which could increase the likelihood of returning to criminal activity. I'd say this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor. Having steady work can reduce the likelihood of recidivism because it provides structure, income, and a sense of purpose. However, having had two jobs might indicate some instability, but overall, employment is a positive sign, so I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it some times in the past month. Substance use, especially ongoing use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Drugs can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. Marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, but any substance use can still pose a risk, so I'd consider this a medium factor.\n\nHe lived in a household of seven as a young child. Growing up in a large household might indicate a higher stress environment or less individual attention, which can contribute to behavioral issues. However, without more context on the family dynamics, this is a lower risk factor compared to others.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his personal life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a moral framework and support system. This could help reduce the likelihood of recidivism, so I'd rate this as a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest risk factors are his prior convictions and substance use. His age and employment status are also considerations. While he has some protective factors like education and religious beliefs, the cumulative effect of the higher-risk factors makes me lean towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, since he has some positive factors like employment and education, my confidence isn't extremely high, but it's significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending without intervention.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while less severe than harder drugs, can still impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs indicates some stability and structure, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and support, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
