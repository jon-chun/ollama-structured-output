    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old Black female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, 22 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions. So I'd say that's a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't play a role here. I won't consider that as a risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 22 is pretty common. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not attending college might limit her opportunities. This could be a medium risk factor because lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. So this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so her abstinence lowers the risk. That's a low risk factor.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in a small household (size 2). Larger family support is generally better, so a smaller household might be a low risk factor, but it's not too significant.\n\nShe believes in God, which can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism. That's a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The main concerns are her age, job instability, and mental health. However, she has protective factors like education, no drug use, and religious beliefs. So I think the overall prediction is low, and I'm about 65% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is relatively young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not extremely high risk.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, but it's not a strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, but not attending college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year could indicate instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years significantly lowers the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate underlying mental health issues that might increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a small household may have limited support, but this is not a strong risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
