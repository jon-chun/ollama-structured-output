    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis physical build is 5'8\" and 140 lbs, which is average and not particularly imposing. I don't see this as a significant risk factor, so low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision and support, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a stabilizing factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially leading to higher risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, which shows some stability and responsibility. Employment is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years indicates substance use, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. This is a high risk factor.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household during youth is a protective factor, reducing risk. So, low.\n\nBelieving in a higher power can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism, so this is another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and drug use, which are strong predictors. The medium factors include prior arrest, living alone, education, and employment. The low factors are physical build, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. The presence of high-risk factors like age and substance use makes me lean towards a higher likelihood of rearrest, so I'll predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some risk but is less severe than a conviction.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision and support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates stability and responsibility, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance use is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
