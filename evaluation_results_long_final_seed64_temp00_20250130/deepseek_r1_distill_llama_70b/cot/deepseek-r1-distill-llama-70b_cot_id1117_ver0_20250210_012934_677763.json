    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but not necessarily found guilty. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that's risky. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some engagement with the justice system, but without convictions, it's not as severe.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant risk factor. It's more of a neutral factor, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college points to lower educational attainment. Education is a protective factor against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. Lack of education is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. Recent drug use, even if not frequent, is concerning. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support and higher risk, but this can vary. I'll rate this as low because it's less directly linked compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education, employment, and drug use. Medium factors include age, arrests, living situation, mental health, and upbringing. Low factors are physical build and religious views. The combination of high and medium factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest, so I predict YES with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of risky behavior, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average physical build does not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism due to limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, potentially leading to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unaddressed mental health issues, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime rates and negative influences.\"),\n    (\"religious views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support, but impact is less direct.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
