    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction could indicate a lower risk compared to someone with multiple offenses, but it's still a factor. I'd say that's a low risk.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. Maybe low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a medium risk factor because without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being enrolled suggests he's engaged in positive activities, which could lower his risk. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or idleness, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending. That's probably a medium risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing, can impair judgment and increase recidivism risk. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, like depression, can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed. That's another medium risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so that's low risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence in his life. Lack of religious affiliation might reduce a potential protective factor, so that's a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are mixed. He has some positives like education and stable upbringing, but also some negatives like unemployment, drug use, and mental health issues. I think the overall prediction is that he might reoffend, so prediction is YES, but my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest and conviction suggest limited criminal history, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in college is a protective factor, suggesting engagement in positive activities.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use may impair judgment and increase recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depressive symptoms can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
