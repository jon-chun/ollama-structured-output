    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old individual to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to criminal behavior. So, I'd consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This suggests he might have a higher likelihood of reoffending, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 230 lbs. While being overweight might have health implications, I don't see a direct link to criminal recidivism, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's married but living alone. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but living alone might mean less social support. However, without more context, I'm not sure how significant this is, so I'll consider it low.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college could be a risk factor. Limited education can reduce job opportunities, leading to higher stress and potential for criminal activity. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. However, having two jobs could also show an effort to be employed, so I'm on the fence here. Maybe medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so not using drugs lowers his risk. That's a low risk factor.\n\nFeeling down some of the time in the past month could indicate mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can increase the likelihood of reoffending, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of 11 could mean less individual attention and possibly a higher stress environment, which might contribute to behavioral issues. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nBelieving that God has a role in his life might provide a sense of purpose and community, which can be protective against recidivism. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several medium and a couple of high risk factors. The multiple arrests and conviction are significant. However, the lack of drug use and potential stabilizing factors like marriage and employment might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards predicting a higher chance of rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because of the mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs shows effort, but frequent changes might signal instability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Limited education can reduce job opportunities and increase stress.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate untreated mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Large household may have contributed to a stressful upbringing.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Marriage can be stabilizing, though living alone might reduce support.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide a sense of purpose and community.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
