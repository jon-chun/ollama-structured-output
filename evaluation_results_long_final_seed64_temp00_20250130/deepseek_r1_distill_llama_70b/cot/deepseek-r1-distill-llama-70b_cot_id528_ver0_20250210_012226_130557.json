    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old Hispanic male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, he's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's significant. Multiple arrests, especially leading to a conviction, indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. This makes me think he's at a higher risk, so I'll mark that as high.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'5\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical build isn't a strong predictor. So I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, so not being married might mean less social support, which could increase risk. Living alone might also indicate limited support systems. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, so having only a GED and not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, increasing the likelihood of returning to criminal activity. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Employment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone back to crime. So I'll mark this as high.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if it's frequent, can be a risk factor. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so maybe this is a medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not currently depressed, this might actually be a protective factor. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area with a household of five. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, and a larger household could mean less individual attention, potentially increasing risk. I'll consider this medium.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this might be a protective factor. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like multiple arrests, unstable employment, and limited education. However, he also has some protective factors like religious beliefs and lack of current depression. Balancing these, I think the prediction leans towards a higher risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Five arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between build and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED without college suggests limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"One job in a year indicates instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban, large household may have limited supervision.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs may provide support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
