    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'll consider this a medium risk factor because it shows some past issues but not a strong criminal history.\n\nHis physical build is 5'5\" and 145 lbs, which is average. There's no indication that his size would make him more prone to criminal behavior, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 19 is common. I'll rate this as medium because the lack of a stable family structure could be a factor.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can provide structure and reduce idle time, lowering the risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can stabilize someone and reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate some instability. I'll rate this as medium because while it's positive, the limited job history isn't as strong a protective factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is great. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so his abstinence lowers his risk. This is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can increase recidivism risk, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe believes in God, which can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism. This is another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a mix of high, medium, and low factors. His young age is a significant concern, but positive factors like education and stable upbringing might mitigate that. I'm leaning towards a lower risk of rearrest, so I'll predict \"NO\" with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the law but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not indicate heightened risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Current enrollment in school is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job suggests some instability but also some engagement.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family upbringing is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide emotional support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
