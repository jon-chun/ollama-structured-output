    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or have less stability in their lives. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions can indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but maybe hasn't crossed the line into more serious offenses. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that might not be too serious yet, so I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis physical build is 5'7\" and 140 lbs. I don't see this as a significant factor because physical size doesn't strongly correlate with criminal behavior. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor, but not being married at 21 isn't unusual. I'm not sure how significant this is, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, which should lower his risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate some instability or not having a consistent income source. I'm not sure, but maybe medium risk because job instability can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal activity, either through drug-seeking behavior or being in environments where crimes occur. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently feeling depressed, this might be a lower risk. However, if he has a history of depression, that could be different, but the info given says he hasn't felt depressed in the past month. So maybe low risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but the stable family background might mitigate that.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not a strong indicator. So I'll consider this low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a big concern. The medium risks from age, employment instability, and prior arrests add up. The low risks from education, living situation, mental health, family background, and religious views help mitigate some of that. So overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't super high because there are positive factors too. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to potential ongoing development and instability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction suggest potential behavioral issues but not necessarily serious offending.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between physical size and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, but not strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in college is a protective factor, indicating positive engagement and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job suggests some instability, which could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reported, which is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family upbringing is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation is a minor risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
