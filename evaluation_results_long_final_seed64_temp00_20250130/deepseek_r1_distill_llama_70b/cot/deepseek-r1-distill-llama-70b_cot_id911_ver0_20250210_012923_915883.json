    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be going through formative years and could be more impulsive.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a bit tricky. An arrest without a conviction might mean he's less likely to reoffend since he hasn't been through the criminal justice system as deeply, but it still shows some level of involvement.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. It doesn't really influence recidivism much.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but not being married at 22 isn't unusual and might not be a big factor on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, which could increase the risk.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Employment stability is important. Having just one job could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed. This is positive. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, and not using drugs lowers his risk. Similarly, not feeling depressed reduces the likelihood of turning to crime as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor. Growing up in an urban area might have its challenges, but having both parents around can mitigate some risks.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective against recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are his young age and job instability. However, he has several protective factors like stable family background, no drug use, and religious beliefs. So, while there are some risks, the protective factors might outweigh them, leading me to predict a lower likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while the factors are mostly positive, the young age and job instability could still pose some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, the individual is in a higher risk demographic for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement, indicating a lower risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces the risk of substance-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression lowers the risk of mental health-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents provides stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
