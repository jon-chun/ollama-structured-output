    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests might not be extremely high, but having a conviction does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some history, but it's not an extensive record.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'3\" and 190 lbs. While this might make him stand out, I don't see physical size alone as a significant risk factor for rearrest. So I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but not being married at 22 isn't unusual. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being enrolled suggests he's trying to improve his situation, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate instability. I'll rate this as medium because job instability could be a risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed. No drug use is a strong protective factor, and not being depressed reduces impulsivity. So both are low risk factors.\n\nHis living situation as a child was with non-biological adults in an urban area. Unstable upbringing can increase risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation might reduce some protective factors, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are mixed. Some are medium, but several are low. His education and lack of drug use are positives. I think the overall prediction is NO, and my confidence is around 65% because while there are some risks, the protective factors are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age bracket for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal involvement, though not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight alone are not significant risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being unmarried at 22 is common and not indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having one job in the past year may indicate some instability, which could pose a risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable living situation as a child could contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce some protective factors but isn't a strong indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
