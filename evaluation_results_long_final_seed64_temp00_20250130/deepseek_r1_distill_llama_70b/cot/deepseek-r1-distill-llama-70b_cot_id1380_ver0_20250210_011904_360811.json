    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This suggests he might not be deterred by legal consequences, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 135 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height. Poor physical health or significant weight could be a sign of neglect or other issues, but I'm not sure how directly this ties to recidivism. Maybe it's a low risk factor because it's less directly related.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending. Not being married at 18 isn't unusual, but the lack of a support system could be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is another risk factor. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to criminal activity. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential recidivism because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. Recent use, even if not constant, is concerning. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which, if untreated, can increase the risk of reoffending. So, this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a rural area as a child. A stable family environment is usually a protective factor, but rural areas might have less access to resources. However, since he did live with both parents, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means less community support, but it's not as strong as others. So, maybe a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most of his risk factors are high or medium. His young age, multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, and substance abuse are all significant. The mental health aspect adds to it. So, I'm leaning towards predicting a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while there are strong indicators, there might be mitigating factors not mentioned here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical health\", \"low\", \"Underweight could indicate neglect but isn't directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities and increases unemployment risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression, if untreated, can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce community support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
