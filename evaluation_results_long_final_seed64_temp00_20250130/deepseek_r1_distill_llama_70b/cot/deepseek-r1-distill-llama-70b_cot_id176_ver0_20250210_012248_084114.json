    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. Prior convictions are a strong predictor of future recidivism, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't immediately stand out as risk factors. Being 6'11\" and 165 lbs might make him stand out in a crowd, but without more context, I don't see this as a direct risk factor. So I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and stable relationships can be protective factors against recidivism, so not being married and living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which could increase risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment and lack of education are known risk factors for recidivism. Without a steady job, he might turn to criminal activities out of necessity or boredom. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can increase the likelihood of recidivism. However, since it's only marijuana and there's no mention of harder drugs, I might rate this as medium. But considering the frequency and potential impact, maybe high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so the absence of recent depression might lower his risk a bit. I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which might increase risk. However, living with a biological parent can provide some stability. I'm torn, but I think the urban environment might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk by offering support and moral guidance. So this is a protective factor, hence low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like age, prior arrests, unemployment, and drug use. These likely outweigh the protective factors. So I predict a high risk of rearrest, with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Ten prior arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics alone do not directly indicate a risk factor without additional context.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital status and living alone may indicate limited social support, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment and lack of higher education are significant predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can contribute to criminal behavior and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk related to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose to higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent provides some stability.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
