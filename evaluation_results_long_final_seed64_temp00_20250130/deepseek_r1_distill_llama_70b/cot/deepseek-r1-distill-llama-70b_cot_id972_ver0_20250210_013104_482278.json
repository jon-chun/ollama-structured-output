    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors. So, I'd consider her age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'10\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to criminal behavior, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest some independence, but without a strong support system, it could be a medium risk factor. However, since she's young, it's not too uncommon, so maybe low.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to fewer options. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. This is a positive sign, indicating she's not involved with substances that could lead to criminal behavior. Definitely a low risk factor.\n\nNo feelings of depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior, but since she's not experiencing depression now, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with biological parents is generally a positive. I'm not sure how significant this is, so maybe low.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a factor, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, most of her risk factors are low, with a couple being medium. Her lack of education is a concern, but her employment and no drug use are positives. I think the overall prediction is that she won't be rearrested, with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to risk.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 18 is not uncommon and not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use indicates lower risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk factors.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with biological parents is generally positive.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation is not a strong indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
