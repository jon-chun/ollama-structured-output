    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors. So age could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant history, so prior criminal behavior is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that low.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might provide some stability, but not being married at 18 isn't unusual. Maybe a low factor here.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can stabilize someone, but only having one job might indicate some instability, so maybe medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years is great. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so this is low.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is low.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so maybe medium.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a factor, but it's not a strong indicator, so low.\n\nPutting it all together, she has a mix of high, medium, and low factors. Her criminal history is a big concern, but she's in school and not using drugs, which are positives. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because of the mitigating factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 18, she is in a high-risk age group for impulsivity and poor decision-making, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted suggests a pattern of illegal activity, increasing the likelihood of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate instability, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone and having a stable household may reduce the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school is a positive factor that can reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk of substance-related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests better mental health, reducing the risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in an urban area may expose her to higher crime rates and influences.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"A lack of religious affiliation may reduce protective factors against criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
