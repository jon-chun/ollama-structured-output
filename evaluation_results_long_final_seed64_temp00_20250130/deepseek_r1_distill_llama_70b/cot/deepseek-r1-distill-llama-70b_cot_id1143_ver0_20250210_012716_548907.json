    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So, I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'5\" and 130 lbs. While this might make him less intimidating, physical stature alone isn't a strong predictor of recidivism. So, I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which could be a risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer job opportunities, which can lead to higher recidivism. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years indicates substance use, which is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can change, so I'll note this as low.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of seven in an urban area might have exposed him to higher crime environments, but living with both biological parents is a stabilizing factor. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has a role in his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education level, employment stability, and drug use. These are strong predictors. The medium factors include age, living situation, upbringing, and religious views. The low factors are arrest without conviction, physical stature, and recent mental health. \n\nConsidering the high factors, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong factors, some elements like no conviction and stable upbringing might mitigate the risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential ongoing behavioral issues and life instability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests some risk but is not as significant as a conviction.\"),\n    (\"physical_stature\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone is not a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk in this area.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large urban household with both parents provides some stability but urban environments can have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
