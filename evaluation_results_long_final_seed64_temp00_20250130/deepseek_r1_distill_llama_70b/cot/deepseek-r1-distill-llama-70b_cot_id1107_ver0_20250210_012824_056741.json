    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but not necessarily guilty, or that he's had close calls. However, multiple arrests can still point to a pattern of behavior that's risky, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 280 lbs. While being overweight can have health implications, I'm not sure how directly that ties to criminal behavior. Maybe in some contexts, but it's not a strong indicator, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and a sense of responsibility, which can lower recidivism risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could be a significant issue. Lack of education often limits job opportunities, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or due to fewer opportunities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held five jobs in the past year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which might be due to unreliable behavior, lack of skills, or other personal issues. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially with harder drugs like cocaine, is a strong indicator of potential relapse and associated criminal behavior. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently depressed, this might lower his risk. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area as a child. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. However, having both parents could provide stability. The large household size might have its own stressors, but overall, I'm not sure how significant this is. Maybe a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective factors against recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, lack of education, and drug use. Medium factors include prior arrests and job instability. Low factors include marriage, health, recent mental health, upbringing, and religion. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are some protective factors in place. Maybe around 72% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral issues despite lack of convictions.\"),\n    (\"health/weight\", \"low\", \"While health issues exist, they don't strongly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Marriage can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits opportunities and increases recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability linked to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Cocaine use is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose to higher crime, but stable family provides some protection.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can offer protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
