    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some past issues but not a strong criminal history.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. Maybe low risk because it doesn't particularly contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities, which could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate instability. So maybe a medium risk factor because job instability can be a concern.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Drug use is a known risk factor, so not using is a low risk.\n\nHe's been feeling down most of the time. Depression or mental health issues can increase recidivism risk because they might lead to poor decision-making or substance abuse. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so this could be a medium risk factor. Living with a biological parent is generally positive, but the urban setting might pose challenges.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age and mental health issues. Medium factors include living alone, job instability, and urban upbringing. Protective factors are education, no drug use, and religious beliefs. The high factors might outweigh the protective ones, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some positives that might mitigate them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and less life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Shows some involvement with the law but lacks a criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Having only one job suggests potential instability, a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health issues\", \"high\", \"Depression can lead to poor decision-making and substance abuse risk.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have higher crime exposure, posing challenges.\"),\n    (\"educational attainment\", \"low\", \"Having a diploma is protective, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
