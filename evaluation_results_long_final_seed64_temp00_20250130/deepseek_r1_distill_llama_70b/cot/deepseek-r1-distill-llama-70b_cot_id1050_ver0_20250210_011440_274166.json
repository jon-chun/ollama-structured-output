    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Hispanic male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and haven't yet stabilized in their lives. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Having a history of arrests and a conviction indicates a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. Two arrests aren't extremely high, but it's enough to be a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 185 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but I don't see how that directly relates to criminal behavior. Maybe in some contexts, but overall, I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might mean less support and more isolation, which could increase the risk. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which might lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can increase the risk of reoffending. I'll rate this as medium because it's a recent feeling but not a long-term diagnosis.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of six. Living in a large household in an urban area might expose him to higher crime environments, but having both parents could provide some stability. I'm not sure how strong this factor is, so I'll consider it low.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this might be a protective factor. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most of his risk factors are high or medium. His young age, lack of education, job instability, and drug use are significant. However, his religious beliefs might help lower the risk a bit. So, I'm leaning towards predicting a higher likelihood of rearrest, but not with absolute certainty. My confidence is around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential involvement in risky behaviors and life instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"high\", \"Holding five jobs in a year suggests job instability, which can lead to financial issues and increased criminal behavior risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can impair judgment and lead to criminal activities, significantly increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate untreated mental health issues, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems, potentially increasing isolation and risk factors.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area may expose to higher crime environments but provides some stability.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
