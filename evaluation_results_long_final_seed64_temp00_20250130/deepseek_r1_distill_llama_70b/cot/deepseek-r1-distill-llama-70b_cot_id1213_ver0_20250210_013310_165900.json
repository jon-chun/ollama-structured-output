    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's enrolled in college, which could indicate a positive direction. I'm thinking age might be a medium risk factor because while young, her engagement in education is a good sign.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests. So, criminal history seems low risk.\n\nHer living situation is alone, which could mean less support or more isolation. On the other hand, living alone at 19 might also indicate independence. I'm leaning towards medium risk here because while living alone can be a challenge, it's not necessarily a strong indicator on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education is a protective factor, so this should lower her risk. I'll mark education as low risk.\n\nEmployment history shows she's held one job in the past year. Steady employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate some instability. I think this is a medium risk factor because it's not a strong stable history.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are both positive signs. Substance abuse and mental health issues are big risk factors, so their absence lowers the risk. I'll rate both as low.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with a large household. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a larger household might have presented challenges. This could be a medium risk factor because of the potential environmental influences.\n\nHer religious beliefs might provide a support system and moral framework, which can be protective. So, religion is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The positive aspects like education and no substance abuse are strong. So, I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, she is in a developmental stage associated with higher impulsivity, but her enrollment in college suggests positive engagement.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates limited criminal history, suggesting lower risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate independence but could also suggest isolation or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college are positive indicators of stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job in the past year suggests some employment history, which is a protective factor, though not extensive.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area in a large household may have exposed her to higher-risk environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide moral guidance and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
