    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old individual to predict if he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is on its own. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had multiple run-ins with the law, but maybe the charges were dropped each time. This suggests some involvement in criminal activity, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor. Maybe low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Also, not being married could indicate less stability. I think that's a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and possibly more opportunities for criminal behavior. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if frequent, can be a risk factor for recidivism. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe it's a medium risk.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently, so mental health might not be a current issue. That could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so that could be a medium risk. Living with just his dad in a small household might mean less supervision or support, but I'm not sure how significant that is.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower social bonds, which might increase recidivism risk. Maybe a medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are the number of arrests and unemployment/education status. Medium factors include age, living situation, drug use, urban upbringing, and religious views. Low factors are his physical build and recent mental health. \n\nSo, with multiple high and medium factors, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong indicators, some factors like no convictions and stable mental health might lower the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"high\", \"Five arrests suggest frequent legal issues, indicating potential criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to idle time and increased criminal opportunities.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support and stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas may have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religious views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce social bonds.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
