    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement in criminal activity, but it still shows some engagement with the justice system. I think this is a low risk factor because the lack of conviction might mean it was a minor offense or a first-time mistake.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase the risk of reoffending due to lack of supervision or guidance. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED, which is a positive sign as it shows she completed her education, but not being enrolled in college might limit her opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. I'll rate education as a low risk factor since having a GED is better than not having one.\n\nHaving held five jobs in a year suggests instability in employment, which can be a stressor and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or due to unstructured time. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use, especially with cocaine, is a significant risk factor. It can lead to criminal behavior to obtain drugs and is linked to higher recidivism rates. So, I'll rate substance abuse as high.\n\nShe's been feeling down most of the past month, indicating possible depression. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, as they might lead to poor decision-making or substance abuse. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a small household in an urban area as a child is generally a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor. So, family background is low risk.\n\nHer religious beliefs might provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So, spirituality is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are employment instability and substance abuse. Medium factors include age, living situation, and mental health. The rest are low. Considering these, I think she's at a moderate risk overall, so I'll predict \"YES\" with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating a lower risk factor.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can contribute to poor decision-making and increased risk of recidivism if left unaddressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
