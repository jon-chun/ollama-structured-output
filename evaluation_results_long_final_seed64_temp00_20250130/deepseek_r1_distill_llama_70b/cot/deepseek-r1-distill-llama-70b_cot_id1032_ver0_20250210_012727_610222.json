    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's not a juvenile anymore, so maybe the risk isn't as high as it could be. I'll mark age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be a strong indicator of future criminal behavior. It could have been a one-time mistake or a minor offense. So, I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHer marital status is married and living with her spouse. Being in a stable relationship can provide emotional support and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities out of necessity or due to fewer opportunities. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the risk of criminal behavior. This is another medium risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, but since she hasn't used drugs recently, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been feeling down lately. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the risk of criminal behavior if not properly addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in a household of size 4. A larger household might indicate a stable family environment, which is a protective factor. So, low risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has control over her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with higher risk, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider this low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most of her risk factors are low or medium. The lack of education and unemployment are the main concerns, but her stable marital situation and no drug use are positives. I think the overall prediction is low, so I'll say NO to rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are some risks, the protective factors are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, she is in a high-risk age group for criminal behavior, but not excessively so.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with her spouse indicates stability and support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increased criminal risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase vulnerability to negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a larger household may indicate a stable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may have minimal impact on criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
