    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old woman based on the given information. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or dealing with impulsivity. So I might rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might have been a first-time offense, or perhaps the charges were dropped. Since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as having a criminal record, so I might consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 115 lbs. I don't think physical build is a significant factor in recidivism unless it's related to specific crimes, which isn't indicated here. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability, but living alone at 22 isn't unusual. It might not have a strong correlation with recidivism, so I'll consider this low.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could be a medium risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate issues with employment, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of reoffending. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, but since she's been clean for four years, this is a positive sign. I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe's been feeling down most of the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risky situations, so this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, she has a mix of low, medium, and a couple of higher risk factors. However, the absence of drug use and a conviction, along with her education and religious beliefs, might lower her overall risk. I think the prediction would be NO, and my confidence is around 65% because while there are some risk factors, there are also protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No indication that height or weight is relevant to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 22 is common and not indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes could indicate instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Four years of abstinence is a positive indicator of low risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent depressive symptoms could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
