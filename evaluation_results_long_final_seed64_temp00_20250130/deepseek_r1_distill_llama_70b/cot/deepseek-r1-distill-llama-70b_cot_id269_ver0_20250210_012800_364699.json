    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's married and living with her spouse, which could provide stability. So, age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction could indicate a lower risk since it didn't lead to a guilty verdict, but it's still a factor. I'd say that's low risk.\n\nHer marital status is married and living with her spouse. Marriage can provide emotional support and stability, which are positive factors. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor as it provides structure and income. Having two jobs shows responsibility, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a big positive. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so her abstinence is a low risk.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with a large household. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, and a larger household could mean less individual attention. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes in God, which can provide emotional support and a sense of community. This is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. Her stable marriage, employment, and lack of drug use are positives. The main concerns are her age and mental health. Overall, I think the prediction is NO for rearrest, with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates responsibility and stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a large household may expose to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
