    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Having a prior record, especially multiple arrests, is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. This definitely points to a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 275 lbs. While this might make him stand out, by itself, physical size isn't a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. This seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can impact employment opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not attending college might limit his job prospects, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides structure and income. However, having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk. So I'm leaning towards medium here.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and association with criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently feeling depressed, this might be a lower risk factor. However, past mental health could still play a role, so maybe medium.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a stable family environment is a protective factor, but urban areas might have higher crime rates. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, prior arrests/convictions, and drug use. Medium factors include employment instability and living environment. Protective factors are marriage, education, and religion. The high factors might outweigh the protective ones, leading me to predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, the presence of stabilizing elements like marriage and employment might mitigate some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"A history of multiple arrests and a conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone is not a strong indicator of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide emotional support and stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not attending college might limit job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs could indicate instability, which might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism due to impaired judgment and criminal associations.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Lack of current depression is positive, but past mental health could still influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"A stable family background is protective, but urban environments might have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide purpose and community support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
