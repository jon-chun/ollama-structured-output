    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while it's not the highest, it's still significant.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction show a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This is probably a high risk factor because prior offenses are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 230 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, by itself, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So I'd rate this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of stable social support, which can be a risk factor. However, it's not as strong as other factors, so maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher recidivism. This is a high risk factor because education is a key factor in rehabilitation and stability.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for reoffending. I'd rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use is a big one. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used them all the time in the past month. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of higher recidivism, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents as a child in a household of four. Stable family background can be protective, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are prior convictions, lack of education, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living alone, and unstable employment. The low factors are physical build, family background, and religious views.\n\nConsidering all these, the high factors are strong predictors. So, I predict a YES for rearrest, with about 85% confidence because while the factors are concerning, there's still a chance for intervention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is within a high-risk age group for recidivism, but not the highest.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight alone are not strong indicators of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent and frequent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation has a mixed relationship with recidivism but is not a strong predictor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
