    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or have less stability in their lives. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests might not be too high, but having a conviction shows that he's had more serious run-ins with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it indicates some criminal history, but it's not an extensive record.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'4\" and 190 lbs. While this might make him stand out, I don't see physical size as a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a stabilizing factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate issues with employment, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of reoffending. So, medium risk here.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal activity, either to support a habit or due to impaired judgment. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of five. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a larger household might indicate less individual attention, which could be a risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is significant, but other factors are medium or low. I think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are mitigating. I'll set confidence at 72%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to potential ongoing development and instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal history, which is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"His height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior, posing a low risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism due to associated risks.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk associated with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"An urban upbringing in a larger household might contribute to environmental risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
