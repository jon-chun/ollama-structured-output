    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger offenders, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the law. I think this is a low risk factor because it's not a repeated pattern yet.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nLiving alone could mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase the risk of reoffending. However, it's not a very strong indicator on its own, so I'll consider that medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might lead to financial instability and increase the risk of recidivism. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which can be linked to criminal behavior, especially if she's using to support a habit. Recent drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nFeeling down for parts of the past month could indicate mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase the risk of recidivism, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a small household at a young age doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor. Unless there were other issues, this seems low.\n\nNot considering God's influence might relate to a lack of social or moral support structures, but this is more subjective. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, and several mediums. The prediction is YES because the factors lean towards a higher risk. My confidence is around 75% because while there are several concerning factors, some are only medium and not all are high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential ongoing development and instability.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest and conviction may indicate limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might suggest a lack of strong support system, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes could indicate instability, which might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially multiple substances, is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unaddressed mental health issues, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a small household does not strongly indicate increased risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may not strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
