    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that this was a first-time offense or a less severe issue. However, having an arrest on record still points to some level of involvement in criminal activity, so I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to pose an increased risk. That's a low factor.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could mean he doesn't have a strong support system, which might contribute to higher risk. Without family support, individuals might be more likely to reoffend, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited education and fewer opportunities, which can lead to higher recidivism. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, this is a medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so his abstinence lowers this risk to low.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is another positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a larger household as a child is generally a stable environment, which is a protective factor. So, low risk here.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events might provide a sense of purpose and accountability, acting as a protective factor. So, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are age and education level. Medium risks include prior arrest, living alone, and employment instability. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because there are several protective factors as well. So, I'll set confidence at 65.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a strong support system may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Limited education can lead to fewer opportunities and higher recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use lowers this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide a sense of accountability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
