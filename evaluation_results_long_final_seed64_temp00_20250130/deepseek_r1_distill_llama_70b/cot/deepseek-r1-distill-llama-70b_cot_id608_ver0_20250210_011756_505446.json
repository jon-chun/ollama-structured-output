    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor because prior arrests and convictions are strong predictors of recidivism. Each arrest increases the likelihood, so three times is a high risk.\n\nHer height and weight probably don't play a big role here. Unless there's something specific about her physical appearance that's relevant, which doesn't seem to be the case, I can consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability, but living alone might not necessarily be a high risk. It could mean independence, but without more context, I'm not sure. Maybe medium risk because living alone could indicate a lack of support systems.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is a big factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might lead to criminal activity. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might lead to criminal behavior due to financial instability. This is probably a medium risk because frequent job changes can be a sign of instability, but it's not as severe as other factors.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit and impairs judgment. This is definitely a high risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health might not be a current issue. If she had been depressed, that could be a risk, but since she's not, maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size three when young. Stable family background can be protective, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are prior convictions, lack of education, and drug use. Medium risks include job instability and living alone. The rest are low. So overall, the prediction is YES for rearrest, and I'm about 80% confident because there are strong factors pointing towards recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 22, while young, this age alone isn't a strong predictor without other factors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and a conviction significantly increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not significant risk factors.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support, which could be a risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma limits opportunities, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing is protective, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
