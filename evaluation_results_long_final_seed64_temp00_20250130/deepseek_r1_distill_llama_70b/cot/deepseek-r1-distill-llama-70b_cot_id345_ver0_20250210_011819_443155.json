    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a moderate risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I'd say this is a low to moderate risk factor because it's a first offense, but it's still a red flag.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 128 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but I don't see how that directly relates to criminal behavior. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical build isn't a strong predictor. So, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and stable relationships often correlate with lower recidivism, so not being married and living alone could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective against recidivism. Not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, increasing the likelihood of returning to criminal activity. This seems like a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, which might drive someone to criminal behavior. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it can still be a risk factor depending on frequency and impact on behavior. However, since it's not specified as heavy use, I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently depressed, this might actually be a protective factor. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, reducing the risk of recidivism. Rural areas might have different dynamics, but overall, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is job instability, which is a strong indicator. The moderate factors include age, living alone, education, and employment. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are both risk and protective factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"Single arrest and conviction with no prior history.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Not pursuing higher education could limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is common but not specified as problematic.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression, which is positive.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs may provide protective support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
