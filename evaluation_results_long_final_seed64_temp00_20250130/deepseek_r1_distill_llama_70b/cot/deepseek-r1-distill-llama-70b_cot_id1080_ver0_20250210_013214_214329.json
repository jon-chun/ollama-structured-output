    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'm thinking age is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests might not be too high, but having a conviction does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I'm leaning towards medium here because it's not an extensive history, but it's not none either.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'4\" and 210 lbs. While this might make him stand out, I don't see a direct correlation between physical size and recidivism. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk, but being unmarried at 21 is pretty common. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a low factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities, which should lower his risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate some instability. I'm thinking medium here because job stability is a factor, but it's not a strong negative.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it can be a risk if it's frequent or linked to other issues. Since it's just marijuana, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not feeling depressed now, this might be a protective factor. So low risk here.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of seven in an urban area. Large households can sometimes mean less individual attention, and urban areas might have higher crime rates. This could be a medium risk factor because of the environment and possible lack of resources.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The protective factors like education and religious beliefs are strong. So I'm predicting a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he is in a higher risk age group for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal involvement, though not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"No direct link between size and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, but common at his age.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college, a protective factor reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"One job suggests some instability, which could elevate risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is common and not strongly linked to high recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Large urban household may have exposed him to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs may provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
