    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to pose a significant risk. That's a low factor.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. Without a stable family environment, individuals might have fewer resources to prevent recidivism. So I'll mark living situation as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. This seems like a medium risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year, which suggests instability in employment. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. So employment history is a medium risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be associated with higher recidivism rates, especially if it's part of a pattern. I'll rate substance use as medium.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a larger household as a child might have provided some stability, but growing up in a household of size five could also mean less individual attention. However, without more info on family dynamics, I'll consider this a low risk.\n\nBelieving in God might provide a sense of purpose and community, which can be protective against recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are a mix of low, medium, and one high. The medium factors like age, living situation, education, employment, and substance use add up. However, the lack of conviction and positive factors like education and religious beliefs might mitigate the risk. So I'm predicting a lower chance of rearrest, but with some confidence because of the medium factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited involvement with the law, indicating a lower risk factor.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not pose a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in a year suggests instability, which can lead to financial stress and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is associated with higher recidivism rates, especially if part of a pattern.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of recidivism, as mental health issues can increase this likelihood.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a larger household may have provided some stability, though less individual attention could be a factor.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
