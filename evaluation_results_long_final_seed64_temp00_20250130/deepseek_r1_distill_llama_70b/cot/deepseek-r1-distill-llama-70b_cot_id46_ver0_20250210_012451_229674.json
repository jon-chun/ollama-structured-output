    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because of impulsive behavior and still developing decision-making skills. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal history with convictions. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'6\" and 287 lbs. That's quite heavy for his height, which might indicate health issues, but I'm not sure how that ties directly to criminal behavior. Maybe limited mobility could reduce certain types of crime, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is another risk factor because it can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity. So, this is high risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism, so not using drugs is a positive sign. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nNo recent depression. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so being mentally stable is a good sign. This is low risk.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, but living with biological parents is generally positive. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social bonds, which might increase recidivism risk. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are age, lack of education, and unstable employment. Medium risks include prior arrest, living alone, urban upbringing, and religious views. Low risks are health, no drug use, and mental health. The high-risk factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, the absence of drug use and mental health issues are positive points. I'll predict a YES for rearrest but with moderate confidence because some factors are mitigating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk of recidivism due to impulsive behavior and developing decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest without conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is less severe than a conviction.\"),\n    (\"health\", \"low\", \"While health issues may exist, they don't strongly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive indicator reducing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Stable mental health reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may expose individuals to higher crime rates and influences.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation can weaken social bonds, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
