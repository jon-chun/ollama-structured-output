    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors and have higher recidivism rates. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low risk.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could mean he doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. That's a medium risk.\n\nHe has a GED, which is a positive as it shows he completed his education, but not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. I'll rate education as medium.\n\nEmployment history shows he's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor for recidivism, so that's medium.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over the past four years, is a concern. Substance use can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior, so that's a high risk.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive factor, reducing his risk, so that's low.\n\nHis living situation as a child with non-biological adults in a small household in a rural area might indicate instability, which can contribute to higher risk. That's medium.\n\nHis religious beliefs might provide a support system, which can be a protective factor, so that's low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are age and drug use. Medium factors include prior arrest, living alone, education, and unstable employment. Protective factors are lack of depression and religious beliefs. The presence of multiple medium and high-risk factors leads me to predict a higher likelihood of rearrest, so I'll say YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing brain development and impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once indicates some level of involvement in criminal activity, but the lack of a conviction suggests it may have been a minor or first-time offense.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age can indicate a lack of stable support systems, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is a positive factor, but not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities and increase idle time that could lead to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability in employment, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use, while common, can still impair judgment and contribute to risky behaviors that may lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month is a positive indicator of mental health, reducing the risk of impulsive or self-destructive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"childhood Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults in a small household in a rural area may indicate instability or lack of support during formative years, which can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has a role in personal events can provide a sense of purpose and accountability, acting as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
