    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that might lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's female. From what I know, males generally have higher recidivism rates than females, so being female might actually be a protective factor. That would probably be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement in criminal activity, or perhaps it was a first-time offense that didn't result in a guilty verdict. This could be a low risk factor since there's no conviction history.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I can consider that a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor. Having steady work, even if it's multiple jobs, suggests stability and responsibility, so this would be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can increase the likelihood of recidivism. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. Feeling depressed could hinder her ability to maintain stability, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and less resources, which could be a risk factor. Living with her mother in a stable household of three might be a protective factor, so this could be low.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, acting as a protective factor. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are a mix of low, medium, and a couple of higher ones. However, the presence of employment and education as protective factors might outweigh the risks. So, I'm leaning towards a lower risk of rearrest, hence a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions suggest less severe criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Steady employment suggests stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than other drugs but can still impact behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can hinder stability and increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing and environment\", \"low\", \"Stable household with biological mother is protective; urban area may have higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
