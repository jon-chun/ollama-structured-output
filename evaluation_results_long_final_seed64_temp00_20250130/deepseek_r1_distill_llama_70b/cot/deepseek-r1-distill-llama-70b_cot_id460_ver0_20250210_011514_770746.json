    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age-related risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low because the absence of a conviction might mean it wasn't a serious offense or there wasn't enough evidence.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 204 lbs. While this might make him stand out, by itself, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Being unmarried at 20 is common, and not living alone could mean he has family support, which is actually a protective factor. So, this is low risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED shows he completed his education, which is positive. Not being in college isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher recidivism. This seems like a medium risk factor because frequent job changes can be a sign of instability or behavioral issues.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism. Using harder drugs like cocaine is more concerning than just marijuana, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Lack of recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is low.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a large household might indicate less individual attention, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower social support, which might be a low risk factor, but it's not as significant as others.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use and medium risks from age and job instability are the main concerns. The other factors are lower. So, I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest, hence a \"YES\" prediction with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 20 years old, the individual is in a high-risk age group for criminal behavior, but not yet at the peak.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in a year indicates instability, which can correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may provide stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED is a positive factor, indicating some level of educational attainment.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower social support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
