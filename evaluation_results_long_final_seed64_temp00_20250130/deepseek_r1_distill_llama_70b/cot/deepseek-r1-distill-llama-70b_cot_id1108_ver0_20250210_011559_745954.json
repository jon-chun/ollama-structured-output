    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 22-year-old Black male who has been arrested three times and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to criminal behavior. So, I think age is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant history. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This makes me think his criminal history is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 235 lbs. While being physically larger might not directly correlate with criminal behavior, in some contexts, it could be a factor. However, without more context, I'm not sure how significant this is. Maybe it's a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of social support. That could be a medium risk factor because without a strong support system, recidivism might be more likely.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is a big factor in employment opportunities and stability. Lack of education can limit job options, leading to higher chances of recidivism. So, this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides structure and income. Having two jobs might show some instability, but it's better than none. I think this is a medium risk factor because while he has some employment, it's not consistent.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse and mental health issues are known risk factors. Since he's clear on both, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of 10 in an urban area. Large households can sometimes have less individual attention, and urban areas might have higher crime rates. This could be a medium risk factor because the environment might contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are criminal history and lack of education. Medium factors include age, living situation, employment, and upbringing. Low factors are physical build, mental health, and religion. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk of recidivism. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong factors pointing to YES, some factors like employment and mental health might mitigate the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning and increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"While being physically larger might not directly correlate with criminal behavior, in some contexts, it could be a factor, but without more context, it's not significant.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which can contribute to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit job opportunities and stability, increasing the chances of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year shows some instability but also some engagement, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_and_mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use or depression suggests lower risk factors related to substance abuse and mental health.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in an urban area might contribute to higher risk due to environmental factors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
