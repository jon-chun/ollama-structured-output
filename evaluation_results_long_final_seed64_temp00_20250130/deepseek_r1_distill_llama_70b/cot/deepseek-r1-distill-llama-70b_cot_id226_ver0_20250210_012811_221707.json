    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while youth can correlate with higher recidivism, it's not the highest on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's significant. Multiple arrests, especially leading to a conviction, indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This seems like a high risk factor because prior offenses are a strong predictor of future behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 175-199 lbs. I don't think physical build is a strong indicator for recidivism, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living situation can be stabilizing factors. Not being married and living with others might indicate less stability, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which is a risk for recidivism. This is a medium factor because education is a known correlate with lower recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to impaired judgment and illegal activities. This is high.\n\nHe's felt down in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed. This is a medium factor because while it's concerning, it's not as directly linked as substance abuse or unemployment.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size four at a young age. Stable family environments can be protective, but if there were issues, it might not be. Without more info, I'll consider this low.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and reducing recidivism. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are prior convictions, unemployment, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living situation, education, and mental health. Low factors are physical build, family background, and religious beliefs. The combination of multiple high and medium factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. I'm about 85% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, may still be developing impulse control and life stability, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Five prior arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not strongly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not being married and not living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps could indicate underlying mental health issues, which, if unaddressed, may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a stable household of size four at a young age does not strongly indicate a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has a role in personal events may provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
