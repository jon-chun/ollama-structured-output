    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could be a problem. Limited education often correlates with fewer job opportunities, which can increase the risk of reoffending. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a low to medium risk. I'll go with medium because job instability can be a risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so not using drugs lowers his risk. That's a low risk factor.\n\nFeeling down in the past month could indicate mental health issues. Depression or other mental health problems can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. So that's a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of eight might have its challenges, like less individual attention or resources, which can contribute to higher risk. I'll rate that as medium.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can be a protective factor. Religious beliefs often provide a support system and moral framework, reducing recidivism. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a mix of medium and low risk factors. The lack of education and mental health issues are concerning, but his stable marriage and no drug use are positives. I think the overall prediction is a medium risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" for rearrest but with moderate confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and lower life stability, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once and convicted indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system, which is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in the past year may indicate some instability, which could be a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years significantly reduces the risk of recidivism compared to active drug users.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the past month could indicate underlying mental health issues, which, if unaddressed, may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household may have contributed to environmental stressors that could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God influences personal events can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
