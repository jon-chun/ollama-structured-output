    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's significant because a history of multiple arrests and a conviction indicates a pattern of behavior that's more likely to continue. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't immediately stand out as risk factors. Being 6'1\" and 165 lbs is within a normal range, so I don't see this as contributing to recidivism. That's a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate less social support, which could increase recidivism risk. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited education and fewer opportunities, which can lead to higher recidivism. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of returning to criminal behavior. So, this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if not severe, can be a risk factor, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Untreated mental health can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five in an urban area might indicate a higher-risk environment, but without more details on family dynamics, I'll consider this a low factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which could provide a support system or positive influence, potentially lowering recidivism risk. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like criminal history, education level, and employment instability. These outweigh the lower-risk factors, leading me to predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while the factors are strong, there's still some uncertainty based on individual circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that may continue.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability and increased likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor, though less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate untreated mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Urban household of size 5 without details on family dynamics is a lower risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a support system, lowering recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
