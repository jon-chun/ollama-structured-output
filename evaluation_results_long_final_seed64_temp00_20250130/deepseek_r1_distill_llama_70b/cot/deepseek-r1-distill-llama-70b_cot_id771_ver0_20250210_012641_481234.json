    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant history. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Unless there's something specific about his physical appearance that's linked to criminal behavior, which I don't see, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and social support, which are protective against recidivism. Since he lacks these, it might increase his risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but not continuing to college might limit his opportunities. However, having a diploma is better than not, so maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Employment is a strong predictor of lower recidivism. Having unstable or minimal employment could increase his risk, so I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed. Substance abuse and mental health issues are big risk factors, but since he's clear on both, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis upbringing was with his biological mother in a small household. Stable family environments are protective, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a mix of medium and high risk factors, especially the criminal history. So I'm leaning towards predicting YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't super high because there are some protective factors like education and no drug use. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and lower life stability, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not have a direct correlation with criminal behavior and thus are not significant risk factors.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and not living alone can indicate a lack of stable social support, which may increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk of substance-related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of mental health-related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a small household suggests a stable upbringing, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"A lack of religious influence may have minimal impact on recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
