    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that he's had some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and between 150-174 lbs. While physical build can sometimes be a factor in certain crimes, it's not a strong indicator on its own for recidivism. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living alone can sometimes correlate with less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially increasing the risk. So medium here.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk. So I'll go with medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it some times in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further legal issues or associate with criminal behavior. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's experienced feelings of depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism if not properly addressed, as they might lead to self-medication or other risky behaviors. So high risk here.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence in his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are drug use and mental health issues, which are significant. The medium factors include age, living situation, education, and employment. The low factors are prior arrest, physical build, family background, and religious views. \n\nConsidering the combination, the high factors are quite influential, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some protective elements like education and family background that might mitigate the risk to some extent.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22, he is in a higher risk age group for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight alone are not significant indicators for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest less social support, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs suggests some stability but possible instability in employment.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Depressive feelings can increase risky behaviors and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support but isn't a strong indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
