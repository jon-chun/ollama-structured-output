    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So, age is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted. Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. Even without convictions, the frequency of arrests is concerning, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 165 lbs. That's average build, so I don't think his physical characteristics pose a significant risk. This is low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Lack of stable relationships and living situation can indicate instability, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. This is medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Limited education can reduce opportunities, leading to higher recidivism. This is high.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism, so this is high.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. While not as severe as harder drugs, any drug use can be a risk factor. However, since it's only marijuana, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not depressed, this is low.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with a large household. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a larger household might indicate less individual attention, so this is medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism, but it's not a strong factor here. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like age, arrests, education, and unemployment. These outweigh the lower factors, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 80% because while the factors are strong, there's some uncertainty based on individual circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"Five arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not pose a significant risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stable living situation may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Limited education reduces opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive sign.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and large household may contribute to risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence is not strongly linked to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
