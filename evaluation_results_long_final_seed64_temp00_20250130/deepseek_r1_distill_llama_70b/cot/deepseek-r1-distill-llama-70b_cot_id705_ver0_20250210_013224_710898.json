    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be going through formative years and could be more impulsive.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a bit tricky. An arrest without a conviction might mean he was involved in something that didn't lead to a guilty verdict, which could be a lower risk factor. But the fact that he was arrested at all could indicate some level of involvement in risky behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't play a significant role here. I don't think physical build is a major factor in recidivism unless it's related to specific crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living situation can sometimes indicate stability. Not being married isn't a big deal at 22, but living with others might provide some social support, which could be a protective factor against recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor; having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, which could increase the risk if he can't find stable employment.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment stability is important. Having only one job might indicate some instability or difficulty in maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and doesn't feel depressed. This is a strong protective factor. Substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism, so his abstinence is a positive sign. Similarly, not feeling depressed reduces the risk of mental health issues leading to criminal behavior.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size four. A larger household might mean more support, but it could also be a strain depending on the family dynamics. However, without more info, I'll consider it a neutral factor but maybe slightly positive if it indicates a supportive environment.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective against recidivism. This is a positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together: his age is a high risk, arrest without conviction is medium, living situation is low, education is medium, job stability is medium, no drug use and mental health are low risks, household size is low, and religious beliefs are low. The protective factors like no drug use, mental health, and religious beliefs are strong. However, his young age and employment instability are concerning. Overall, I think the risk is lower because the protective factors outweigh the risks, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe a 65% confidence in a NO prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"An arrest without conviction indicates some involvement but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide social support, reducing isolation-related risks.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job suggests potential instability, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of mental health issues contributing to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"A larger household may offer support, though dynamics can vary.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide purpose and community support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
