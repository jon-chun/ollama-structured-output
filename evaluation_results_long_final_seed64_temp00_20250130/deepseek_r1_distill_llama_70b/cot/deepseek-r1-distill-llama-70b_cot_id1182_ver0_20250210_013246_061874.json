    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested seven times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, which indicates a pattern of criminal behavior. This makes me think his criminal history is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and stable relationships can sometimes reduce recidivism, so living alone without a strong support system might increase his risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but since he's not pursuing higher education, this might limit his opportunities, increasing his risk. So, medium risk here.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can stabilize someone and reduce criminal behavior, so having a job is a positive factor. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially illegal drugs, is linked to higher recidivism rates. However, marijuana is legal in some places, but it's still a substance that can influence behavior. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive because mental health issues can increase recidivism. So, mental health is a low risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with a large household might expose him to higher crime environments, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes in God, which can provide a support system and reduce recidivism. So, religious beliefs are a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high criminal history and medium factors like age, living situation, education, drug use, and upbringing make me predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are several risk factors, there are also some protective factors like employment and religious beliefs that might lower the risk a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential involvement in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Seven arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics such as height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried and living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held jobs suggests some stability, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use, even if not recent, can still be a risk factor for recidivism, especially if linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests better mental health, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a large household may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide a sense of purpose and support, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
