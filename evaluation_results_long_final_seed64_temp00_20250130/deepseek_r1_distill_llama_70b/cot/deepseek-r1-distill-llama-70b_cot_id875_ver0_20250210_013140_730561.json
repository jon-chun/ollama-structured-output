    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more prone to impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that this was a first-time offense or a less severe issue, which could lower the risk compared to someone with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Maybe if he were significantly larger, it could be a factor in certain types of crimes, but 6'1\" and 165 lbs is average, so I don't think this is a significant risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence recidivism. Being single and living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the risk, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism rates because it can limit job opportunities, leading to higher stress and potential return to criminal activity. However, having a GED is better than not having one, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could increase the risk of recidivism. But it's not clear if he lost the jobs or left them voluntarily, so I'm not sure how significant this is.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a common factor in recidivism. It can impair judgment and lead to further criminal behavior, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk. However, the absence of depression doesn't necessarily mean good mental health overall.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of six. A stable family environment with both parents is a protective factor, which lowers the risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but living with both parents could mitigate that.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk by offering a support system and moral framework.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are his young age, limited education, and drug use. However, he has protective factors like living with both parents and religious beliefs. His employment history is a bit unstable, which could be a moderate risk. Overall, I think the risk is medium, but considering the protective factors, the prediction might lean towards a lower likelihood of rearrest. My confidence isn't very high because there are several factors that could go either way.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"First-time arrest without conviction suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED limits opportunities but is better than none.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could indicate higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a common risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs may provide moral framework.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
