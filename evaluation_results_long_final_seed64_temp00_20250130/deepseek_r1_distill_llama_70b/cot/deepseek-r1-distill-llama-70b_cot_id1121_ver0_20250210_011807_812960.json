    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is on its own. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd say medium risk here.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'5\" and 135 lbs. That's a slight build. I don't think physical build is a major factor in recidivism, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. On the other hand, not being married at 19 is pretty common, so maybe medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and associating with negative influences. High risk here.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so not using drugs lowers his risk. Low risk.\n\nNo recent depression. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving in an urban area as a child. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences, so this could be a medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, but it's not a strong indicator. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are lack of education and unemployment. Medium factors include age, prior arrest, living alone, and urban upbringing. Low factors are build, no drug use, no depression, and religious views. The high factors are significant, so I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are some positive factors like no drug use and stable mental health. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to potential recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"While not convicted, an arrest indicates potential involvement in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Slight build is less likely to be a significant factor in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase criminal involvement risk.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and negative associations.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may expose individuals to higher crime rates and influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
