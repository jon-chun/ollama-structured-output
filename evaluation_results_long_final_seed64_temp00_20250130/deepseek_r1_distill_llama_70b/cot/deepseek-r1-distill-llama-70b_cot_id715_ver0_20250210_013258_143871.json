    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but maybe the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This could suggest some involvement in risky behavior, but without convictions, it's a bit unclear. I might rate this as medium because it shows some engagement with the legal system, but not necessarily a strong pattern yet.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'10\" and 190 lbs. I'm not sure how much physical build factors into recidivism. Maybe in certain contexts, but I don't recall it being a major risk factor. I'll probably consider this low unless there's a specific reason to think otherwise.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some independence, but it could also mean she doesn't have a strong support system. Marriage isn't necessarily a protective factor, but living alone might contribute to isolation, which could be a risk. I'm leaning towards medium here.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can limit job opportunities and lead to unemployment, which is another risk factor. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a risk factor. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to engage in criminal activity. I'd rate this as high.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal behavior to obtain drugs or while under the influence. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe this isn't a current issue. However, if she has a history of depression, that could still be relevant, but the information given doesn't specify that. I might rate this as low.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a rural area as a child. A stable family environment is generally a protective factor, so this might lower her risk. Rural areas might have different challenges, but overall, having both parents could be positive. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, which might reduce the likelihood of recidivism. This could be a protective factor, so I'll rate it as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are lack of education, job instability, and drug use. Medium factors include living alone and prior arrests. The low factors are age, physical build, mental health, family background, and religious beliefs. The high factors seem to outweigh the others, so I'm leaning towards predicting a higher risk of recidivism. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet and has some protective factors, my confidence isn't extremely high, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 18, she's young but not in the highest risk demographic for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions indicate some legal involvement but not a strong pattern.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between build and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited support, a potential risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, so lower risk here.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"May provide moral support, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
