    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be going through formative years and may not have fully developed impulse control. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it's still a factor. I think this is a medium risk because it shows some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not extensive.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 140 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical build isn't a strong predictor. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 22 is pretty common. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, which should lower his risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate some instability or difficulty in maintaining employment. I'm not certain, but maybe this is a medium risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it some times in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can increase the likelihood of recidivism. Marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, but it's still a risk. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This could be a medium risk factor because poor mental health can lead to negative coping mechanisms.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this should be low risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but the stable family background might offset that.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are mixed. He has some positive factors like education and religious beliefs, but also some negatives like drug use and mental health issues. I think the overall prediction is that he might not be rearrested because the positive factors could outweigh the negatives. My confidence is around 65% because there are several factors that could go either way.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between height/weight and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Being unmarried and living alone at 22 is common and not indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college and having a job suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder drugs, indicating some risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
