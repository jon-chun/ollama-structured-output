    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. That could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but maybe the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This could suggest some involvement in risky behavior, but without convictions, it's a bit unclear. I might rate this as medium because it shows some engagement with the legal system, but not necessarily a strong pattern yet.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 115 lbs. I don't think physical size is a significant factor here. It doesn't really relate to criminal behavior, so I'll consider this low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some independence, but it could also mean she doesn't have a strong support system. Marriage isn't necessarily a protective factor, but living alone might be a neutral factor. I'm not sure, but maybe it's low since it's not a strong indicator either way.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could be a risk factor. However, it's not as significant as other factors like employment or substance use. I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which could increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to further criminal behavior, either through drug-seeking activities or impaired judgment. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior, but since she's not feeling depressed now, that's a good sign. I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a stable household of size 4 when she was young. A stable family environment is a protective factor. It suggests she had support growing up, which can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. This is a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective against recidivism. This is another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is significant. The medium factors are her arrests without convictions and unemployment. The rest are low. So, considering these, I think the overall prediction is that she might reoffend, but I'm not extremely confident because some factors are mitigating. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 18, she's young but not in the highest risk group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions indicate some legal involvement but not a strong pattern.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"No jobs in the past year could lead to financial instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 18 isn't a strong indicator of risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide protective support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
