    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that doesn't seem to pose any particular risk. I'll mark that as low.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could indicate a lack of stable social support, which is a known risk factor. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited educational attainment. This can affect employability and stability, increasing the likelihood of recidivism. That's a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year, which points to unemployment. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of criminal activity. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use is a big one. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has used some in the past month. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism, as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis mental health is another concern. Feeling down for parts of the past month could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can increase the risk of reoffending, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHis living situation as a child\u2014living with non-biological adults in an urban area\u2014might have exposed him to higher-risk environments. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and unstable living conditions can contribute to delinquency. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nLastly, his religious views, or lack thereof, might affect his support system. If he doesn't feel connected to a religious community, he might have fewer social ties, which can be protective against recidivism. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education level, unemployment, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living situation, mental health, and childhood environment. Low factors are prior arrest, physical build, and religious views. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk of rearrest. My confidence is around 80% because while there are strong indicators, some factors like the lack of conviction and average build might mitigate the risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and less life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but is less severe.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not pose specific risk.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married suggests lack of stable social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Limited educational attainment affects employability and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment leads to financial instability and higher criminal activity risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is strongly linked to impaired judgment and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with non-biological adults may expose to higher-risk environments.\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious ties might reduce social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
