    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't see any indication that his physical build would contribute to recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not being married and living alone could be a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. This could be a medium risk factor because frequent job changes might suggest issues with stability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a common factor in recidivism. It can impair judgment and lead to further legal issues. I'll rate this as high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk. Rural areas might have different challenges, but overall, the family support is positive.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. So this is low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and drug use. Medium factors include prior arrest, living situation, education, and employment. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because there are both high and medium factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some risk but is less severe than a conviction.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, which can be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs suggests potential instability or difficulty in maintaining employment, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
