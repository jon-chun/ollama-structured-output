    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that he's had run-ins with the law, but the lack of convictions could mean the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. This could be a moderate risk factor because it shows some involvement with the legal system, but not necessarily a pattern of serious offending.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 230 lbs. While this might make him stand out, I don't think physical size alone is a strong indicator of recidivism. It might be more relevant in specific contexts, like violent crimes, but without knowing the nature of his arrests, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 18 is pretty common. This might be a low to moderate risk factor, but I'm leaning towards low because it's not uncommon for someone his age to live alone, especially if he's in school.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school. Education is a positive factor as it can provide structure and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. This should be a low risk factor because it's a protective factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. Having multiple jobs might indicate responsibility, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common and not as strongly linked to recidivism as harder drugs. However, any drug use can be a risk factor, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this might be a low risk factor. However, if he had a history of depression, that would be different.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban household of five. Living in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates, but living with his biological mother could provide stability. Household size isn't directly a risk factor, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a protective factor and a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the two arrests and marijuana use. However, the presence of school enrollment and employment are strong protective factors. His age is a moderate risk, but the positive factors might outweigh that. So, I'm leaning towards a lower risk of rearrest. My confidence is around 65% because while there are some risk factors, the protective factors are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests indicate legal involvement, but no convictions suggest less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"While noticeable, size alone isn't a strong predictor without context.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Common at his age, especially if in school, so less indicative of risk.\"),\n    (\"enrolled in school\", \"low\", \"Provides structure and reduces recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stability from jobs reduces criminal behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"marijuana use\", \"medium\", \"Common but can indicate substance use patterns.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, so lower risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with biological mother.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Can provide support and reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
