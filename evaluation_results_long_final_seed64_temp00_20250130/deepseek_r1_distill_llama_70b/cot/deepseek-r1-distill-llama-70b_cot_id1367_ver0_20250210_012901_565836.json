    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while youth can correlate with higher recidivism, it's not the highest on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's significant. Multiple arrests, especially leading to a conviction, indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This seems like a high risk factor because it shows a history of engaging in criminal activities despite previous legal consequences.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 230 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, physical size alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism. So I'd rate this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk, but not being married at 19 isn't unusual. This feels like a medium risk factor because the lack of a stable family structure could contribute to higher risk, but it's not as strong as other factors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is a big factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher recidivism. This is a high risk factor because it directly impacts his ability to find stable employment, which is a key component in reducing recidivism.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Not having consistent work can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone back to criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities to support a habit. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might lower his risk a bit. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might contribute to higher risk. However, living with his biological mother provides some stability. This is a medium risk factor because the environment could be a risk, but family support might mitigate it.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, which might reduce recidivism. This is a low risk factor because it could be a protective factor against reoffending.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors: multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use. These are strong indicators for recidivism. However, his religious beliefs and lack of current mental health issues might lower the risk a bit. So, I'm leaning towards predicting YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Five arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"While physical size might intimidate, it is not a significant predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism due to impaired judgment and potential criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk compared to if mental health issues were present.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may pose risks, but living with a biological parent provides some stability.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
