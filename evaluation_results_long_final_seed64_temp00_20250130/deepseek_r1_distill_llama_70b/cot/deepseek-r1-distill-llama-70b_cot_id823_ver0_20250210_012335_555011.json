    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to criminal behavior. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, males are more likely to reoffend than females, so her gender might lower her risk. That could be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could continue, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that's not really a risk factor. I'll note it as low.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. That seems like a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could be a medium risk.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, so that's medium.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent use, can increase the likelihood of reoffending, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior if not addressed, so that's a medium risk.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults as a child in a large household. Unstable living conditions can increase risk, so medium.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, she has several high-risk factors like prior convictions and drug use, but also some protective factors like marriage and religion. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because of the mitigating factors. Maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have a lower recidivism rate compared to males.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior that may continue.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average physical build does not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"living situation as a child\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults in a large household may indicate instability in early life.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
