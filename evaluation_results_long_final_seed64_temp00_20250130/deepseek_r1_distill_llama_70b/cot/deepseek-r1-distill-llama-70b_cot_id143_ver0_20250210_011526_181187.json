    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally considered higher risk because they might still be going through formative years and could be more impulsive. So I'm thinking age is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to criminal behavior, so that's a non-factor, low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk, but being unmarried at 22 isn't unusual. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree, which is a positive factor. Education often correlates with lower recidivism, so this is a low risk.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate instability or issues with employment, which could lead to criminal behavior out of necessity or due to unstructured time. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used them in the past month. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to criminal activity to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's experienced depression recently, feeling down for periods. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism if not properly addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low risk. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but since she had a stable household, the risk is lower.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence in her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor as it might reduce a sense of community or moral framework, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll mark this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a major concern, but she has positive factors like education and stable upbringing. The medium factors like age and job instability add to the risk, but not overly so. Overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't very high because there are mitigating factors. So I'll set confidence at 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests some involvement but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"medium\", \"Four jobs in one year may indicate instability, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to higher risk if not properly managed.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a Bachelor's degree is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family background with both biological parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may slightly increase risk but is not a strong factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
