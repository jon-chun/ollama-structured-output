    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age where decision-making isn't fully matured.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low because it's a single incident without a proven outcome.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't think this contributes much to recidivism risk, so low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living alone can sometimes indicate stability, so not having these might suggest less stability. However, at 20, it's common not to be married or living alone, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can limit job opportunities and lead to more criminal activity. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to recidivism as it might lead to financial instability. This is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use is a major risk factor, but since he hasn't used any, this is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not feeling depressed now, this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving in a household of 11 at a young age. Growing up in a large household might indicate a stressful or unstable environment, which can contribute to behavioral issues. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not as strong as others. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are lack of education and employment instability. The medium factors include age, living situation, household size, and religious views. The low factors are prior arrest, drug use, mental health, and physical attributes. \n\nConsidering all these, the high education and employment issues are significant, but the absence of drug use and mental health issues are positives. So, I'm leaning towards a medium risk overall, but I think the prediction might still be YES because the high factors are quite impactful. My confidence is around 65% because while there are strong factors, there are also mitigating ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity and less life stability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests some legal involvement but not a strong pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism due to limited opportunities and higher likelihood of unemployment.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate instability, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone and being unmarried at 20 may indicate a lack of stable personal life, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household size during youth\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household may have contributed to environmental stressors that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"A lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support and protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
