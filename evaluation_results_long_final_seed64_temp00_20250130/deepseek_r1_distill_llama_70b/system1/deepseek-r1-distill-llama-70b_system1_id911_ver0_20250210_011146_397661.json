    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be a strong indicator, but it's something to note.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 185 lbs. That's a average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but it's not a direct risk indicator. He's held one job in the past year, which might suggest some instability, but it's not a major red flag.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. That's positive; substance abuse and mental health issues can be significant risk factors, but he seems clear there.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor. Believing that God influences his life might provide emotional support, which is positive.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are neutral or positive. The arrest is the only concern, but without a conviction, it's not enough to indicate high risk. So, I'd say the prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"age: 22\",\n    \"gender: male\",\n    \"race: White\",\n    \"arrested once, not convicted\",\n    \"height: 6 feet 0 inches\",\n    \"weight: 185 lbs\",\n    \"never married\",\n    \"living alone\",\n    \"high school diploma, not in college\",\n    \"held 1 job in the past year\",\n    \"no drug use in past four years\",\n    \"no depression in past month\",\n    \"lived with both biological parents at a young age\",\n    \"household size: 5\",\n    \"urban area\",\n    \"believes God influences personal events\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
