    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean the charges were dropped or dismissed, which might lower the risk compared to a conviction. However, the fact that he was arrested could still indicate some level of involvement in risky behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and between 150-174 lbs. That's a bit underweight for his height, but not drastically so. Maybe indicates possible health issues, but not a direct risk factor for criminal behavior or other risks.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors. Not being married at 22 isn't unusual, though.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can impact job prospects and stability, which might relate to risk factors. Having only a high school diploma could limit his opportunities, potentially increasing risk if he's struggling financially.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate difficulty maintaining employment, which can lead to financial stress.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other behaviors, especially if it's frequent. However, marijuana is legal in some places, so the risk might be lower than with other drugs.\n\nHe sometimes feels down and unable to be cheered up. This could indicate depression or low mental health, which is a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes, including substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban household of five. Living with both parents is generally a positive, but a larger household in an urban area might have its own challenges, like overcrowding or limited resources, which could contribute to risk factors.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be the arrest (even without conviction), recent drug use, signs of depression, job instability, and limited education. These could contribute to a higher risk of negative outcomes. However, the absence of a conviction and the fact that he's holding down jobs (even if two in a year) might mitigate some risk. The mental health aspect is concerning and could elevate the risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level around 65%. It's not extremely high, but there are enough factors to warrant concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest without conviction\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\", \"job instability\", \"limited education\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
