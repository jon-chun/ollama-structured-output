    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors, but alone they don't indicate high risk. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal record can influence future behavior and opportunities.\n\nShe's 6 feet tall and weighs 155 lbs. Her physical build doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor unless it's related to other behaviors, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect stability, but not necessarily a direct risk factor. Not having a high school diploma or GED is a concern because lower education levels can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nShe's enrolled in a 2-year college, which is a positive factor as it shows she's trying to improve her situation. Holding only one job in the past year could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if frequent, can be a risk factor for other behaviors. She's felt down several times in the past month, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Mental health struggles can increase the risk of other negative outcomes.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. A stable family background might be a protective factor, but living in an urban area could expose her to more risks depending on the environment. She believes God influences her life, which might provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the conviction, lack of education, limited employment, drug use, and mental health issues are concerning. However, her enrollment in college and stable upbringing might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" with a confidence level around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"limited employment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
