    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it still shows some involvement with the law, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'5\" and 135 lbs. That's a bit below average for a male, but I don't see how that directly relates to risk factors unless in specific contexts like physical altercations, but that's not indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate some independence, but not necessarily a risk factor. Not being married is common at that age.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socioeconomic challenges, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment, especially prolonged, can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors out of necessity or opportunity.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a known risk factor, so not using drugs is a good indicator of lower risk.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risks, but living with a biological parent might provide some stability.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could relate to his support system or coping mechanisms. Lack of religious support might not be a direct risk factor, but it could influence his mental health or social connections.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be the arrest, lack of education, and unemployment. However, the absence of drug use and recent depression are positive points. The other factors like age, living situation, and background don't strongly indicate high risk on their own.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not high. The confidence is a bit lower because while there are some concerning factors, the absence of substance abuse and mental health issues lowers the overall risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"no high school diploma\", \"unemployed\", \"lives alone\", \"urban upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
