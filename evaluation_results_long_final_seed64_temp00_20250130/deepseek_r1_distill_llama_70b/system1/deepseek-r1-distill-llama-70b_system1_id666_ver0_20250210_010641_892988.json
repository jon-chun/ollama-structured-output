    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive factor on its own. Next, he's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, so that's a point towards higher risk.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 140 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong indicators of risk, so I'll note that but not give it much weight.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not a major one. Being enrolled in school is a positive factor as it indicates engagement in productive activities, which might lower risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can sometimes be linked to higher risk, especially if it's associated with other factors like criminal history. So that's another point towards higher risk.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to dependency and other risky behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, which might lower the risk. Believing that God influences his life could provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: he has a criminal history, unemployment, and drug use, which are risk factors. However, he's in school, has a stable upbringing, and no recent depression. The presence of both risk and protective factors makes it a moderate risk. I'm about 60% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
