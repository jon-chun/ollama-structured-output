    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without other factors, it's neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions are significant. Two arrests and a conviction could point to a history of problematic behavior, which might increase risk. However, I don't know the nature of the crimes, so it's a bit unclear. If they were minor offenses, maybe not as high risk, but if they were serious, that's a different story.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 3 inches and 190 lbs. Physical size alone isn't a risk factor unless it's used in a context that suggests aggression, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but not necessarily high risk on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is usually a positive factor. Being enrolled suggests he's trying to improve his situation, which might lower risk.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having a job might indicate responsibility, which could lower risk, but only having one job in a year might suggest instability, so that's a bit of a mixed signal.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. No drug use is a positive sign, and not feeling depressed reduces the risk of mental health-related issues.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults at a young age in an urban area. Unstable living situations as a child can be a risk factor for behavioral issues later on. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior, but this isn't a direct indicator.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with certain risk behaviors, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrests and conviction, living alone, and unstable childhood. However, he's educated, employed, and hasn't used drugs or shown signs of depression. These positive factors might mitigate the risks. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't strongly indicate a high risk overall. I'm about 65% confident that the risk isn't high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested 2 times\", \"convicted\", \"lived with non-biological adults\", \"urban upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
