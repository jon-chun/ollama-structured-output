    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, especially if they're recent or related to serious offenses, but I don't have specifics here.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and weighs 135 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk behavior unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest independence, but it could also mean less social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. She's held five jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher risk behaviors or lifestyle instability.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially if it's recent. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Growing up in a household of size three at a young age\u2014small household size might mean more individual attention, which is generally positive.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the drug use and job instability are concerning, but she's educated, not depressed, and has a supportive belief system. The arrests and convictions are there, but without knowing the nature, it's hard to weigh. Overall, I think the risk is moderate, so I'll predict \"NO\" with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests and convictions\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
