    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but race isn't typically a direct indicator. So, I'll note that but not weigh it too heavily.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in criminal behavior, which could indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 3 inches and between 200-224 lbs. While physical size might be a factor in certain contexts, on its own, it doesn't necessarily indicate risk without other behavioral factors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can sometimes correlate with stability, but alone they aren't definitive indicators of risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor as it might limit job opportunities and stability, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor as it may indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which can contribute to other issues.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a positive factor as substance abuse and mental health issues can significantly increase risk. The absence here might lower the overall risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban upbringing can have various influences, but without more context, it's hard to assess. Living with a biological parent is generally a positive.\n\nHe feels that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could relate to his support system or outlook, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher risk. The lack of education and unstable employment add to that. However, the absence of recent drug use and mental health issues are positive points that might lower the risk a bit. So, I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but not with complete certainty. Maybe around 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unstable employment\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
