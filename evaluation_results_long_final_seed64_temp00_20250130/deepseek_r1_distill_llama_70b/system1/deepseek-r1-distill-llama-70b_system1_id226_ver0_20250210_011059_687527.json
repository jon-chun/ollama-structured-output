    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. Age can be a factor, but 21 isn't particularly high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested five times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because multiple arrests and a conviction can indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to reoffending.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs between 175-199 lbs. I'm not sure how much physical size contributes to risk assessment, but maybe it's considered in terms of potential threat, though I'm not certain about its weight in this context.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 21 isn't unusual, but living situation might relate to stability. Not living alone could mean he has family support, which might be a protective factor, but if he's living with others in a stressful environment, it could be a risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors due to fewer options.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of criminal activity.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a known risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities. Recent drug use, especially cocaine, is more concerning than marijuana.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can increase risk if not addressed, possibly leading to self-destructive behaviors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size four at a young age. Stable family environment might be a protective factor, but if there were issues like abuse or neglect, it could increase risk. However, the information given doesn't specify any negative family dynamics.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal happenings. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose or community, which might reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, unemployment, lack of education, recent drug use, and mental health issues are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like living with family and religious beliefs might mitigate risk, the combination of negative factors likely outweighs them. So, I would predict high risk with high confidence, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"unemployment\", \"lack of education\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
