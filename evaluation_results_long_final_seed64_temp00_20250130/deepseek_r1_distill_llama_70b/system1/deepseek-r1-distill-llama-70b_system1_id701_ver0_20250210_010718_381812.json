    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual these days, so maybe not a big risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not attending college could relate to socioeconomic factors or opportunities, but it's not a direct risk indicator. She's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate instability or issues with employment.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and, depending on frequency, might not be a major risk factor unless it's heavy use. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Living with both biological parents in a rural area as a child could be a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor. She doesn't believe God has control over her life, which might relate to her coping mechanisms or support systems.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and job instability. However, without a conviction, the arrest is less severe. The rest of the factors don't strongly indicate high risk. So, I would predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"held 4 jobs in the past year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
