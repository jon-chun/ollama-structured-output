    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and race aren't inherently risk factors on their own, but they can sometimes correlate with other factors. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can indicate potential for reoffending, although one arrest might not be too severe depending on the nature of the offense.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 140 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically indicate risk unless there's something unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could suggest a lack of strong social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors. Not being married at 22 isn't unusual, though.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally a positive factor, as it can lead to better opportunities and stability. However, if he's struggling in college, that might be a different story, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment history can be a risk factor if it's unstable, but having one job in a year isn't necessarily bad, especially if he's a student.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some of the time in the past month felt down. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other substances. The feelings of being down could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can increase risk if not addressed.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this might lower his risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behaviors and providing a support network.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and conviction, drug use, and possible mental health issues. However, he also has protective factors like education and a stable upbringing. The risk isn't extremely high, but it's present. I'd say the prediction is YES, but the confidence isn't too high, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest and conviction\", \"drug use\", \"possible mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
