    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Next, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 115 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically indicate risk unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of support system, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not pursuing higher education can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but it's not definitive. She hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor as it might lead to financial instability or other issues.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more severe issues. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign regarding mental health.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of four when young. A stable family environment is generally a protective factor, reducing risk. She believes God has something to do with her life, which can provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use is a red flag, but other factors like stable upbringing and lack of depression might mitigate the overall risk. Her unemployment and lack of education could contribute, but without more severe indicators, the risk might not be extremely high. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a prediction of \"NO\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests without conviction\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
