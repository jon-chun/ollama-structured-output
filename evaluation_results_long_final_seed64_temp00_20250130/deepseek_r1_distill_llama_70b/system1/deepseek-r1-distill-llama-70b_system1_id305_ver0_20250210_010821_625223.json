    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive indicator on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest that he's had run-ins with the law, but since there are no convictions, it's unclear how serious those incidents were. It could indicate a higher risk, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That's pretty average, so I don't think physical characteristics here are a significant risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might not be unusual, especially if he's in school. Not being married at this age is pretty common, so I don't see this as a major risk factor.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school. Education is usually a positive factor, as it can indicate stability and lower risk of negative behaviors.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having some employment history is a good sign, showing responsibility, which might lower risk.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other risky behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background can be protective against higher risks. Urban environments can have their own challenges, but having both parents around is a positive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce certain risk factors by promoting positive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor here is the drug use. However, other factors like being in school, having a job, and a stable upbringing might mitigate that risk. The lack of convictions and no recent depression also lower the risk. So, while there's some risk due to drug use, the overall factors don't point to a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"arrests without conviction\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
