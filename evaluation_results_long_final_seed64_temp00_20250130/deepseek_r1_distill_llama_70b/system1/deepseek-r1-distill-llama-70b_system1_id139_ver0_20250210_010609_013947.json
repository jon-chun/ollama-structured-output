    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be a strong indicator, but it could suggest some involvement or behavior that led to the arrest, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 134 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor unless it's related to something else, which it doesn't seem to be here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, and not being married at this age is pretty common, so I don't see that as a significant risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit future prospects, but again, not a direct risk indicator.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability can be a factor, but two jobs in a year might just indicate she's exploring options or had temporary work, not necessarily a risk.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or interferes with life. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, so the risk might be moderate.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which is a significant risk factor if not addressed. It can lead to other problems if untreated.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban household of three. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this might lower her risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by providing coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest, drug use, and mental health issues are the main risk factors. However, her education, stable upbringing, and beliefs might mitigate these risks. The lack of conviction and the nature of the drug (marijuana) might not be as severe. So, while there are some risk factors, they might not be high enough to indicate a high overall risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so the prediction would be \"NO\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"past marijuana use\", \"recent feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year.
