    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Next, she's been arrested three times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because a history of arrests and convictions can point to a higher risk of reoffending or other issues.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs 120 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk factors unless there's something specific, which there isn't here. So I can probably set that aside.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can sometimes relate to stability, but alone they aren't definitive. Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college might indicate lower educational attainment, which can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including unemployment or lower socioeconomic status.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, suggesting possible issues with employment or behavior. Now, she's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other risky behaviors.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive, but the absence of depression doesn't necessarily negate other risk factors. Her living situation as a child\u2014living with her biological mother in a household of size three\u2014is pretty standard and doesn't raise any red flags. Believing that God has something to do with her life might provide some stability or support, which could be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the history of arrests and convictions, drug use, lower educational attainment, and job instability are all risk factors. However, she's young, which might mean she can still turn things around. The lack of depression and a spiritual belief might lower the risk a bit. So, while there are several concerning factors, they might not all be at the highest level of risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so maybe a confidence level around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"lower educational attainment\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
