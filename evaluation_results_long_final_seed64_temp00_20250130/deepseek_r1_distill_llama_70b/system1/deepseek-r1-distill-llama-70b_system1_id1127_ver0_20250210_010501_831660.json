    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which could indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 200-224 lbs. His physical size might be relevant in certain contexts, like if the risk is related to physical altercations, but alone, it's not a strong indicator.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect employment opportunities, which in turn can influence risk factors. Not being enrolled in college might limit his future prospects, but having a diploma is a positive.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially illegal drugs, can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, though marijuana's legal status varies by place. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign regarding mental health.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which might lower risk factors by providing a moral framework.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators of high risk. While other factors like job instability and drug use contribute, the stable family background and lack of depression are mitigating factors. So, I'd predict high risk but with moderate confidence because some factors are positive.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Job instability\", \"Drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
