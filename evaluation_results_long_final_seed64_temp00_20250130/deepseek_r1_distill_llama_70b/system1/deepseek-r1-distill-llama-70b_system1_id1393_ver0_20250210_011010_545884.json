    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be a strong indicator, but it could suggest some involvement with the law, which might be a risk factor depending on the context.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'10\" and 165 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, and not being married at this age is pretty common, so I don't see that as a significant risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit future prospects, but it's not a direct risk indicator.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some recent use. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or affects her life.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which is a significant risk factor if not addressed.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have different challenges, but living with a biological parent is generally a stable factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be the job instability, recent drug use, and signs of depression. These could indicate a higher risk, but they're not extremely severe. The confidence level might be moderate because while there are concerns, they aren't the most severe indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"held 4 jobs in the past year\", \"past drug use (marijuana)\", \"recent feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
