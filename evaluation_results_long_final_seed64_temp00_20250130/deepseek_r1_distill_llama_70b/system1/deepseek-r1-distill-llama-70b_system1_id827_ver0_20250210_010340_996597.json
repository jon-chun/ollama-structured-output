    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but age alone isn't a strong indicator. Next, he's been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which suggests a history of engaging in illegal activities, so that's a red flag for high risk.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 160 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically indicate risk, so I can probably ignore that. He's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 18 is normal, but not living alone might mean he's still dependent, which could be a factor, but not a major one.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and is often linked to higher risk of recidivism or other negative outcomes. He's held only one job in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues and other risky behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower the risk of self-harm, but doesn't necessarily offset the other factors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size three. A smaller household might mean more individual attention, but without knowing more about the family dynamics, it's hard to assess. He believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor, providing stability and support.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use are all significant risk factors. His belief in God might help, but the other factors are strong indicators. So, I'd predict high risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unstable employment\", \"Drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
