    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, especially if they're recent or related to serious offenses. However, without knowing the nature of the arrests, it's hard to gauge the severity.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and between 200-224 lbs. That puts him in an overweight category, which can be a health risk factor, but not necessarily related to behavioral or recidivism risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for various issues, including recidivism or mental health concerns.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment is a known risk factor for unemployment, poverty, and recidivism. Education often provides stability and opportunities, so this could be significant.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor, as it might indicate difficulty maintaining employment, which can lead to financial instability and other issues.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if frequent or combined with other substances, can be a risk factor. However, marijuana alone, especially if not problematic, might not be as significant as harder drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of recent depression is a positive sign, but mental health can fluctuate, so it's something to monitor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban household of three. Stable family environment can be protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates or exposure to risks.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks by promoting positive behavior and social connections.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors seem to be the criminal history (arrests and conviction), lack of education, job instability, and living alone. These factors can contribute to a higher risk of recidivism or other negative outcomes. However, the absence of recent depression and having a religious support system might mitigate some risks. The drug use is moderate, so it's a factor but not the most severe.\n\nI think the overall risk is moderate. The presence of several risk factors like criminal history and socioeconomic instability points towards a higher risk, but the mitigating factors like religious beliefs and lack of recent mental health issues lower the confidence a bit. So, I would predict a high risk but with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"low educational attainment\", \"job instability\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
