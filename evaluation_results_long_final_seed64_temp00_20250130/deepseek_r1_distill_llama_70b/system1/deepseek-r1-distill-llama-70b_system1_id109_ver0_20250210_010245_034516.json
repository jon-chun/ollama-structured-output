    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A criminal history is a known risk factor, but only one arrest and conviction might not be a strong indicator on its own. It depends on the nature of the offense, which isn't provided here.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a risk factor. Being married and living with his spouse could be a protective factor, as stable relationships often reduce risk.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college might indicate lower socioeconomic status or educational attainment, which can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including recidivism or unemployment.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, which could suggest instability or perhaps he's still figuring out his career path. Job instability can be a risk factor for financial issues or other problems.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a stronger risk factor than past use, so this might lower his risk.\n\nHe's felt down some of the time in the past month. This could indicate mild depression or stress, but it's not at a level that suggests severe mental health issues unless it's persistent or worsening.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size eight could mean overcrowding or less individual attention, which might be a risk factor for behavioral issues or stress, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the criminal history, lack of education, and job instability. However, he has protective factors like a stable marriage, no recent drug use, and religious beliefs. The mental health aspect is mild, so it might not pose a significant risk on its own.\n\nI think the overall risk isn't extremely high, but there are some factors that could contribute to potential issues. So, the prediction would be \"NO\" because the risk isn't high, but the confidence isn't too high either because there are some concerning elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"low educational attainment\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 8. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
