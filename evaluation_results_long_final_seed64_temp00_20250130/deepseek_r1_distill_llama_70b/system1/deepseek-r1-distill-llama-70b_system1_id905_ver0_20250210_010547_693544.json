    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race can sometimes be factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 175-199 lbs. That's a normal build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate limited social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. He's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. That's positive; it shows he's managing his mental health and substance use well. Growing up, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. A stable family environment with both parents can be protective, but a larger household might have its own challenges, though not necessarily negative.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behaviors and social connections.\n\nPutting it all together, the main potential risk factors are the two arrests and job instability. However, the lack of convictions, stable mental health, and positive personal beliefs are mitigating factors. The overall risk seems moderate, but not high. So, I would predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested twice\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
