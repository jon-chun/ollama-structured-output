    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but being young might relate to higher impulsivity. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean he's had some issues but not severe enough to lead to a conviction, which might lower the risk a bit.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 145 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate some independence, but not necessarily a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not attending college could limit his opportunities, which might be a socioeconomic factor. He's held one job in the past year, which suggests some instability or perhaps he's just starting his career, so that's a bit of a neutral point.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. However, he's been feeling down most of the time in the past month. That's a red flag for depression, which can be a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes, including self-harm or other behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally a stable factor. He believes God influences his life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are his recent depression and the arrest. However, the lack of drug use and stable family background might mitigate some risks. His age and job situation are somewhat neutral. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't seem to add up to a high risk overall. I'm about 65% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"feeling down\", \"young age\", \"living alone\", \"not in college\", \"held one job\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
