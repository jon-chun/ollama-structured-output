    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to societal factors, but without context on how that influences risk, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be a strong indicator of high risk, as it could be a one-time incident or something that didn't lead to further issues.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'6\" and 190 lbs. That gives her a BMI of around 32, which is considered obese. Obesity can be a health risk factor for various conditions, but in terms of behavioral or social risk, it might not directly indicate high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate independence, but it could also suggest limited social support, which might be a risk factor if she's isolated.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a positive factor, indicating stability and lower risk. Being enrolled suggests she's on a positive trajectory.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Having a job shows responsibility, but only having one job might indicate some instability or perhaps she's just starting her career, which is common at her age.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. These are positive indicators. Avoiding drugs and not experiencing depression lowers health and behavioral risks.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. A stable family environment with biological parents is a protective factor. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than personal risk.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and lower certain risks by promoting positive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: she's young, has some stable factors like education and employment, no substance abuse, and a supportive upbringing. The arrest is a concern but without conviction, it's less severe. Her health due to weight could be a risk, but overall, the positive factors likely outweigh the negatives. So, I don't see a high risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"age\", \"arrest history\", \"living situation\", \"education\", \"employment\", \"health\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
