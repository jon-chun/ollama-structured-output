    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Asian/Pacific Islander male. Age is a factor, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. His ethnicity might have some cultural implications, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history can indicate a higher risk, especially if it's a recent conviction. However, one arrest and conviction might not be a strong indicator unless it's for a serious offense, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 145 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but not drastically so. Physical characteristics alone don't usually indicate risk unless there's something else, like signs of substance abuse or neglect.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, especially if he's in college. Not being married at this age is pretty common, so that might not be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a positive factor. Being enrolled suggests he's motivated and has opportunities, which could lower risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, especially if it's a long-term issue. It might indicate instability or lack of structure, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use is a risk factor, but marijuana is generally considered lower risk compared to harder drugs. However, frequent use can still have negative effects.\n\nHe sometimes feels down and unable to be cheered up. This indicates possible depression or low mental health, which is a significant risk factor. Mental health issues can contribute to higher risk behaviors, especially if left untreated.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, which lowers risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but again, without specific context, it's hard to gauge.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means he lacks a support system, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction, unemployment, drug use, and mental health issues are the main risk factors. However, his educational enrollment and stable upbringing are protective factors. The mental health issue is concerning, but without knowing the severity, it's hard to weigh. The drug use is present but not extreme. The conviction is a red flag, but one offense might not be indicative of a high-risk individual. Overall, I think the risk is present but not extremely high. So, prediction is YES, but confidence is moderate, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
