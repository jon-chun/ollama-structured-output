    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black female. Age and race might not be direct risk factors, but being young could relate to inexperience or ongoing development. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it still shows some involvement with the law.\n\nShe's 5 feet tall and weighs 140 lbs. I don't see how height and weight directly relate to risk factors unless in specific contexts, which aren't mentioned here. Moving on, she's never been married and isn't living alone. Not living alone could mean she has a support system, which might lower risk, but it depends on the household dynamics.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower earning potential. She's held four jobs in a year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other behaviors or mental health issues. Feeling down could indicate depression, which is a mental health concern.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a large household of 10 in an urban area. A stable family structure with both parents might be a protective factor, but a large household in an urban area could have its own challenges, like limited resources or exposure to higher-risk environments.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life, which might provide emotional support and be a protective factor against certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education, job instability, drug use, and mental health concerns are risk factors. However, living with both parents and her faith might mitigate some risks. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. Overall, while there are some risk factors, they might not be high enough to indicate a high risk overall. So, I would predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 10, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
