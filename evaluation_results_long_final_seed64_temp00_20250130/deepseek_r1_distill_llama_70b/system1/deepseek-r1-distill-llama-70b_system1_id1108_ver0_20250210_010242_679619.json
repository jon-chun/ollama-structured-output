    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but race alone isn't a risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are significant because they indicate past involvement in criminal activity, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight (5'10\", 235 lbs) don't directly relate to risk unless considering physical strength, but that's more situational.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence social support. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism rates as it can limit job opportunities and stability.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a protective factor, but frequent job changes might indicate instability, which could be a risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive; substance abuse and mental health issues are risk factors, so their absence is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up in a large household (size 10) in an urban area. Large households might indicate less individual attention, and urban environments can have higher crime rates, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: the criminal history is a strong risk factor, but the absence of drug use and mental health issues, along with employment, are protective. The living situation and education are mixed. I think the risk is present but not extremely high. So, prediction is YES, but confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"low educational attainment\", \"unstable living situation\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
