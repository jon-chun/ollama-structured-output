    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but I'm not sure how race plays into this beyond potential systemic issues.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in risky or illegal behavior, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 165 lbs. That seems a bit underweight for his height, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk factors. Maybe it could relate to health issues, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including mental health issues or recidivism.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and higher rates of recidivism. It can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which is a stressor and can contribute to higher risk behaviors, including substance abuse or criminal activity.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other substance use or dependency. Feeling down could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which can increase risk if left untreated.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five in an urban area with his biological mother. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risks, but living with his mother might provide some stability. However, a larger household size could mean less individual attention or resources.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unstable employment, drug use, and mental health concerns are strong indicators of high risk. While his religious beliefs might offer some support, the other factors are significant enough to outweigh that. I'm about 85% confident in this assessment because most of the factors point towards higher risk, but there might be some mitigating circumstances not mentioned here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"unstable employment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
