    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement in risky behavior, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 140 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate social isolation, which can sometimes be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a positive factor, suggesting stability and lower risk. He's held one job in the past year, which is a bit low but not necessarily a major concern unless it indicates instability.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can be associated with higher risk behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, reducing risk. However, urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support, which might be a protective factor for some, but it's not directly a risk factor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the drug use and the arrests. However, the lack of convictions, stable family background, and educational enrollment are positive. The drug use is concerning, but without other major factors, it might not be high risk. So, I'm leaning towards a lower confidence that these factors indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested 2 times\", \"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
