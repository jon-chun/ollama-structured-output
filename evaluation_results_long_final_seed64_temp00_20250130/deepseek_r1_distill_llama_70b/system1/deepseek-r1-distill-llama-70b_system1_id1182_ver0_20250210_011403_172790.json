    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which suggests a history of engaging in criminal behavior. This is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 142 lbs. Physical characteristics don't typically indicate risk unless in extreme cases, which this isn't. So, this factor is neutral.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can relate to social support. Living alone might indicate less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect employment opportunities, which in turn can influence criminal behavior. Not having higher education might limit job prospects, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs in the past year. Employment instability could be a risk factor as it might indicate financial instability or difficulty maintaining steady work, which can contribute to criminal activity.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be a risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to further criminal behavior. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so the impact might be lower.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Current mental health status is important. Not feeling depressed could mean he's stable, but past mental health issues might still be a factor if they exist.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large household in an urban area might expose him to higher crime environments, which can be a risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose or community, which might reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators of high risk. Employment instability and drug use add to the risk, but the presence of a high school diploma and religious beliefs might mitigate it slightly. However, the criminal history is significant enough to lean towards a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Employment instability\", \"Drug use\", \"Urban upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
