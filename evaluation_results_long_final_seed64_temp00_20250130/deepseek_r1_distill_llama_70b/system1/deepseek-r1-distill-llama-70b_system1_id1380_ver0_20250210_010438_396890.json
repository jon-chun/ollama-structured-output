    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but age alone isn't a strong indicator. Next, he's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 135 lbs. His weight might be on the lower side, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk factors. Maybe it's related to health, but not directly a risk indicator for behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest some level of independence, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's a risk factor. Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could indicate lower educational attainment, which sometimes correlates with higher risk behaviors or limited opportunities, potentially increasing risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or increased likelihood of engaging in illegal activities. Drug use is a big one\u2014using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of risky behaviors.\n\nHe's felt down a lot in the past month. That could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can be a risk factor if left untreated. It might lead to self-destructive behaviors or further substance abuse.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in a rural area. A stable family environment might be a protective factor, but living in a rural area could have its own challenges, like less access to resources. He doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation might not be a direct risk factor, but it could influence his support system or coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, convictions, drug use, unemployment, lack of education, and possible mental health issues all point towards higher risk. His age and living situation are less clear, but the other factors are strong indicators. I'm pretty confident, maybe around 85%, that these factors indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"unemployment\", \"lack of education\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
