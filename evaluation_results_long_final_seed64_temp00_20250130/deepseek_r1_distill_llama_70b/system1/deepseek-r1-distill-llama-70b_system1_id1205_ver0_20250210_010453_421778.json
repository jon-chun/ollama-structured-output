    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors depending on context, but alone they don't indicate much. Being young might mean she's still developing, but without other factors, it's neutral.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean she was detained but not found guilty, which might not be a strong indicator of risk. It depends on the circumstances, but without a conviction, it's less severe.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 160 lbs. That's within a normal range, so no issue there.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate independence, but it could also suggest limited social support. Not being married at a young age isn't unusual these days.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability or idleness, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors. However, she's only 19, so she might still be figuring out her career path.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, so her abstinence is a good indicator.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, so this is a point in her favor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of three. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally a stable factor. Household size of three isn't too large, so that's manageable.\n\nShe doesn't feel that God influences her personal life. This could relate to her support systems or coping mechanisms. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can be protective, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main potential risk factors are her unemployment and living alone, but she has several protective factors like no drug use, no recent depression, stable upbringing, and no convictions. The lack of strong negative indicators makes me lean towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"unemployment\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
