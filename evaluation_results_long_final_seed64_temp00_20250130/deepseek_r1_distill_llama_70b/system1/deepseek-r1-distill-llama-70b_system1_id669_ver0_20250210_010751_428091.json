    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female of mixed race. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being 18 is on the lower end for criminal behavior, though it's a common age for such assessments.\n\nShe has been arrested five times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which suggests a history of engaging in illegal activities. Recidivism is a concern here because multiple arrests often correlate with higher risk.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5'6\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't think height and weight are strong indicators of risk unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some level of independence, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's a risk factor. Not being married at 18 is pretty common, so maybe not a big issue.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can be risk factors because they might indicate instability or a lack of structure, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior, as it can lead to dependency and engagement in illegal activities to support a habit.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While mental health issues can be a risk factor, the absence of depression here might lower the risk compared to someone who is depressed.\n\nShe lived with adoptive parents in a rural area as a child. The adoptive part might not be a big factor, but growing up in a rural area could have different implications. However, without knowing more about the household dynamics, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, as religion can provide a support system and moral framework, but this can vary widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, drug use, lack of employment and education are strong indicators. However, her age, lack of depression, and stable living situation (living alone but not necessarily in a bad environment) might mitigate some risk. So, while there are significant risk factors, they might not all be at the highest level. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but maybe not the highest confidence.\n\nI think the prediction should be YES, but the confidence might be around 70%. There's enough here to indicate risk, but some factors might not be as severe as others.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"drug use\", \"lack of employment and education\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
