    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior, though it's just one incident.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 185 lbs. That's average build, so no risk there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate some isolation, but it's not a strong risk factor on its own. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college, which is positive. Education is usually a protective factor against high-risk behavior.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability can be a factor, but having two jobs might just mean he's working hard rather than being unstable. He hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. That's good because substance abuse and mental health issues are major risk factors, and he seems clear there.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults as a child in a household of four. Unstable living situations can be a risk factor, but the household size is moderate, so maybe not too bad. He believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor as it might provide emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor is the arrest and conviction. However, the other factors like education, stable mental health, and positive outlook might mitigate that risk. So, while there's some risk, it's not high overall. I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once and convicted\", \"lived with non-biological adults as a child\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
