    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can be factors, but being young might mean she's still developing and could be more impressionable or have less stability. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean she's had a run-in with the law, but it wasn't severe enough to lead to a conviction. This might indicate some risk-taking behavior, but not the highest.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'5\" and 174 lbs. That gives her a BMI of around 31, which is obese. Obesity can lead to health issues, which might be a risk factor for certain outcomes, but I'm not sure how it ties into behavioral or social risks.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 could indicate independence, but it might also mean she doesn't have a strong support system. Not being married is common at her age, so maybe not a big risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, lead to lower income, and potentially increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors or having fewer resources.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or personal issues that affect her ability to maintain a job.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor for other substance use or dependency. It can also impair judgment and contribute to other risky behaviors.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can increase the risk of various negative outcomes, including substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults as a child in an urban area. Unstable living conditions as a child can contribute to behavioral issues, lack of support, and increased risk of various negative outcomes later in life.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. This might indicate a lack of a support system or different coping mechanisms, which could be a risk if she doesn't have other forms of support.\n\nPutting it all together, several factors stand out: lack of education, limited job stability, drug use, mental health issues, and an unstable childhood. These can contribute to a higher risk of negative outcomes. However, she's young, so there's potential for intervention and change. Her arrest without conviction is a concern but not the most severe. The mental health aspect is significant because it can exacerbate other issues.\n\nI think the overall risk is moderate to high. The confidence level should reflect that while there are several concerning factors, some elements like the single arrest and young age might balance it a bit. So, maybe a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"young age\", \"lack of education\", \"unstable employment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\", \"unstable childhood\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
