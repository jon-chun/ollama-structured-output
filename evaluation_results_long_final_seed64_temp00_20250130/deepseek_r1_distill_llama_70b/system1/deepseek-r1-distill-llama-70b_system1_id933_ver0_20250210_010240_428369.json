    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still a flag.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 185 lbs. That's average build, so probably not a risk factor. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some independence, but not necessarily a risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower earning potential. He's held one job in the past year, which could indicate instability or limited work experience.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. That's positive; substance abuse and mental health issues can be significant risk factors, so their absence is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a household of five. A stable family environment is a protective factor, reducing risk. He believes God influences his personal events, which might provide emotional support and reduce risk behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the lack of education and job instability are concerns, but the stable upbringing, absence of substance abuse, and mental health are positives. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. Overall, these factors don't strongly indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once but not convicted\", \"no high school diploma or GED\", \"held only one job in the past year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
