    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher impulsivity. Next, he's been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions can indicate a history of problematic behavior, which might suggest higher risk.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 260 lbs. That's quite heavy, which could relate to health issues, but not directly a risk factor for behavior. Being unmarried and living alone might indicate social isolation, which can sometimes be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, which might influence risk factors, but it's not a direct indicator. He's held one job in the past year, which could suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, which might influence behavior. He believes God influences his life, which might provide some stability or support, potentially lowering risk.\n\nPutting it all together: history of arrests, convictions, possible employment instability, drug use, and mental health issues are significant. However, his belief system might offer some protective factors. The combination of these factors, especially the criminal history and drug use, leans towards a higher risk, but not extremely high. So, I'll predict YES with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"employment instability\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
