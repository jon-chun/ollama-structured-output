    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors depending on context, but being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate some involvement with the law, but without convictions, it's not as severe. It could mean he's had run-ins but hasn't been found guilty, so maybe not a strong indicator.\n\nHe's 6'2\" and 230 lbs. That's a large build, which might be relevant in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but on its own, it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest independence, but not necessarily a risk factor. Not being married at 18 is pretty common, so that might not be significant.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education is usually associated with lower risk behaviors as it provides structure and opportunities.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, showing responsibility, though job turnover might indicate instability. But two jobs in a year isn't too bad, especially at 18.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and, depending on frequency and context, might not be a major risk factor unless it's heavy use. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is a stable factor. Household size might relate to socioeconomic status, but not directly a risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the positive factors like being in school, employed, and having religious beliefs likely lower the risk. The arrests without convictions and drug use are there, but not as severe. So, I don't see a high risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested twice\", \"marijuana use\", \"urban upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
