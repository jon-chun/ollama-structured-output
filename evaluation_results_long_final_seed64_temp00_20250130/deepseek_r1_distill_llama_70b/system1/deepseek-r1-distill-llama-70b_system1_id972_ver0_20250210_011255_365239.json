    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Her race doesn't particularly indicate a risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it still shows some level of involvement with the law, which could be a minor risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'10\" and between 150-174 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some independence, but not necessarily a risk. Not being married at a young age is pretty common these days.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. This could be a significant risk factor because education is often linked to better opportunities and lower criminal behavior. Without a diploma, she might face more challenges in employment and personal development.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a positive sign. No recent substance abuse or mental health issues lowers the risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Living in an urban area might have its challenges, but having a stable family structure with her biological mother could be a protective factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. This might indicate a lack of religious support, which can sometimes be a protective factor, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the lack of education and job instability. However, the absence of drug use and mental health issues, along with a stable upbringing, might mitigate these risks. So, while there are some risk factors, they might not be high enough to classify her as high risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"lack of high school diploma or GED\", \"job instability\", \"arrest without conviction\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
