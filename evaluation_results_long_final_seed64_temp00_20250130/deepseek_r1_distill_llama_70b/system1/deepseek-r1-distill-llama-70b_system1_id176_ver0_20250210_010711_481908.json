    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which suggests a history of engaging in criminal behavior. This is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'11\" and 165 lbs. That seems underweight for his height, which might indicate possible health issues, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk assessment unless it's related to substance abuse or neglect.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor, but not necessarily on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor as it might lead to financial instability, which could increase the likelihood of criminal activity.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can be a risk factor for various behaviors, though marijuana is generally considered less severe than other drugs. However, it's still a factor to consider.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with risk, but the absence here might lower the risk a bit.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with family might provide some stability. His belief in God could be a protective factor, providing emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions are the most concerning factors. Unemployment and living alone are also risk factors, but the lack of recent depression and having a supportive belief system might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but the confidence isn't 100% because there are some protective factors present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"high arrest and conviction history\", \"unemployment\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
