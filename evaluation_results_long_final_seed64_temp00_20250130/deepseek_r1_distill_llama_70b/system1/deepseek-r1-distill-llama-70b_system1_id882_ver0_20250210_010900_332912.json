    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. So, that's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. So, that's a moderate risk factor.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 9 inches and he weighs 185 lbs. That's quite tall and underweight for his height. Maybe that could indicate something about his health or lifestyle, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk factors. Maybe low to moderate.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 isn't unusual, but it might indicate some social isolation, which can be a risk factor. So, moderate risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not attending college could limit future opportunities, which might contribute to risk factors like unemployment or lower income. Moderate risk.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. That could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor. Moderate to high.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or leads to other issues. Moderate risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign, so low risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of four when young. Stable family environment, which is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nHe feels God has nothing to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk if it means less social support, but it's not a strong indicator. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest, job instability, and drug use. However, the lack of conviction, stable upbringing, and no current depression are mitigating factors. So, overall, the risk is moderate. I'll predict \"NO\" for high risk with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": {\n    \"age\": 18,\n    \"gender\": \"male\",\n    \"race\": \"White\",\n    \"arrests\": 1,\n    \"convictions\": 0,\n    \"height\": \"6 feet 9 inches\",\n    \"weight\": 185,\n    \"marital_status\": \"never married\",\n    \"living_situation\": \"alone\",\n    \"education\": \"high school diploma\",\n    \"college_enrollment\": false,\n    \"jobs_held\": 1,\n    \"drug_use\": \"marijuana\",\n    \"depression\": false,\n    \"family_background\": \"lived with both biological parents\",\n    \"religiosity\": \"God has nothing to do with personal life\"\n  },\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
