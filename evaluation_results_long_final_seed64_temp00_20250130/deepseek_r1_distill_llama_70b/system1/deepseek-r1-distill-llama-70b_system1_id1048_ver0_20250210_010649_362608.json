    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might mean less life experience, which could be a factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a significant point. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHe's 5'5\" and 145 lbs. Physical characteristics don't directly relate to risk behavior, so I can probably set that aside.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and family can sometimes provide stability.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can reduce recidivism by providing structure and opportunities.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for criminal behavior because it can lead to financial instability and idleness.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a major risk factor as it can lead to impaired judgment and contribute to criminal activity.\n\nHe's felt down in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, including substance abuse and criminal activities.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and living in such an area might expose him to more risks. However, living with his mother might provide some stability.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor as it might mean less involvement in community support structures, but this can vary widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, and living alone are all significant risk factors. His enrollment in school is a positive, but the negatives seem to outweigh that. So, I would predict high risk with high confidence, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
