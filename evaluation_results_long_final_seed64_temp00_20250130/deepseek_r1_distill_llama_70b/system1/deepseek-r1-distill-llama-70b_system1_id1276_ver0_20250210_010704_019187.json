    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean she's at risk of future legal issues, but it's not a conviction, so maybe lower risk than if she had been convicted.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 110 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but not severely. Maybe indicates possible health issues, but not a major risk factor for recidivism or other behavioral risks.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest independence, but could also indicate a lack of support system, which might be a risk factor for other issues.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not having higher education can limit job opportunities, which might increase the risk of unemployment or engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nShe's held 5 jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher risk of financial instability or other problems.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues, health problems, and impaired judgment.\n\nShe's felt down most of the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues, which can increase risk of self-harm, substance abuse, or other negative behaviors.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family background might be a protective factor, but urban areas can have higher crime rates and other risks.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use and mental health issues are significant risk factors. However, her stable upbringing and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The lack of conviction and stable living situation also lower the risk. So, while there are some concerning factors, they might not add up to a high risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 5 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
