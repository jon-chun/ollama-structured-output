    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female from the American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut community. I know that certain demographics can have higher risk factors due to societal issues, but I'm not sure how significant this is on its own.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's unclear how serious these issues were. It could still point to a higher risk, but maybe not the highest.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't contribute much to the risk assessment.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, reducing risk. However, being married at 19 might also indicate other issues, but I'm not certain.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socioeconomic challenges, which might increase risk.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, which is a risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug. Recent use in the past month could indicate ongoing issues.\n\nShe's experienced feelings of depression recently. Mental health issues can increase risk, especially if left untreated.\n\nShe grew up in a rural area with her biological mother in a small household. Rural areas might have less access to resources, which could be a risk, but living with a biological parent might provide some stability.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Spirituality can be a protective factor, providing support and reducing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use, lack of education, unstable employment, and mental health issues are significant risk factors. However, being married and having a spiritual belief might mitigate some risks. The arrests without convictions are a bit of a wildcard. I'm leaning towards high risk because of the drug use and mental health, but the confidence isn't 100% because of the mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"Mental health issues (depression)\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unstable employment\", \"Arrests without conviction\", \"Young age\", \"Rural upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
