    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some level of risk, but it's not a conviction, so it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 180 lbs. That's pretty average, so I don't think physical characteristics here pose a risk.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 20 is normal, and living with others could actually be a protective factor, providing support.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or facing socioeconomic challenges.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability, another risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive sign. Substance abuse is a known risk factor, so not using drugs is a good indicator.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently. Mental health is important, and not feeling depressed is a positive sign, though it doesn't rule out other issues.\n\nLived in a household of 11 as a child. Growing up in a large household might indicate overcrowding or economic hardship, which can be risk factors for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe feels that God has nothing to do with his life. This could relate to a lack of social support or a different coping mechanism, but it's not directly a risk factor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the lack of education and job instability. However, the absence of drug use and recent depression, along with living with others, might mitigate some risks. The arrest without conviction is a concern but not as severe as a conviction. The large household and religious views are less directly related.\n\nI think the overall risk isn't extremely high, but there are some factors that could contribute to risk. So, I might lean towards a moderate risk, but not high. Therefore, the prediction would be \"NO\" with a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"arrest without conviction\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
