    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but without convictions, it's unclear if she's a high risk. Maybe she's had some issues, but not severe enough to lead to convictions.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 140 lbs. That's within a normal range, so I don't see that as a risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate independence, but it could also suggest limited support systems, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors or mental health issues.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socioeconomic challenges, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate financial instability, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a positive sign. No recent substance abuse or depression lowers the risk factors.\n\nShe grew up in a household of six. Large family size might indicate overcrowding or limited resources, which can be a risk factor for stress or limited opportunities.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and lower risk factors by providing a sense of community and purpose.\n\nPutting it all together, the lack of education and job instability are notable risk factors. However, the absence of drug use and depression, along with her religious beliefs, might mitigate some risks. The arrests without convictions are concerning but not definitive. Overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't seem to add up to a high risk assessment. So, I would predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested 3 times without conviction\", \"lack of high school diploma or GED\", \"job instability\", \"living alone at 18\", \"grew up in a large household\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
