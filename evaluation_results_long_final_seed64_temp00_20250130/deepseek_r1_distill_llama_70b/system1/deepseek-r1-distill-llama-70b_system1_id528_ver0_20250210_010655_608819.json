    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being Hispanic alone isn't necessarily a risk factor. Next, he's been arrested five times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because multiple arrests and a conviction can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'5\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong indicators of risk. Then, he's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower education levels can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but it's not a direct indicator. He's held one job in the past year, which might suggest instability in employment, another possible risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or associated with other issues, but marijuana alone might not be as significant as harder drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Growing up, he lived with his biological dad in a household of five in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so that might be a risk factor. Also, having a larger family might not necessarily be a risk, but the environment could play a role.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events, which might provide some stability or support, potentially lowering risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators. Employment instability and living alone are moderate factors. Drug use is present but not severe. The urban upbringing could contribute. The presence of religious belief might mitigate some risk. So, overall, the risk is present but maybe not extremely high. I'll predict YES with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"employment instability\", \"urban upbringing\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
