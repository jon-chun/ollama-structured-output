    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Next, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some issues, but without knowing the context, it's hard to gauge the severity.\n\nShe's 5'10\" and weighs 190 lbs. Her BMI would be around 34.9, which is obese. Obesity can lead to health risks like diabetes or heart issues, so that's a potential factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate independence, but it could also mean limited social support. Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could affect her future employment prospects and socioeconomic status, which are risk factors for various issues.\n\nShe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate problems with employment, possibly due to personal issues or other factors. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for health and legal problems, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive, but mental health can fluctuate. Growing up with both biological parents in a rural area might provide some stability, but rural areas can have limited resources. She believes God influences her life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together: her age, lack of education, job instability, and drug use are concerning. However, the absence of convictions, living situation, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a confidence level around 60% seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Age: 18 years old\", \"Gender: Female\", \"Race: White\", \"Arrests: 2 times (no convictions)\", \"Height: 5 feet 10 inches\", \"Weight: 190 lbs\", \"Marital Status: Never married\", \"Living Situation: Living alone\", \"Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\", \"Employment: Held 5 jobs in the past year\", \"Drug Use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\", \"Mental Health: No depression in the past month\", \"Family Background: Lived with both biological parents at a young age, household size 5, rural area\", \"Religious Beliefs: Believes God has something to do with personal events\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
