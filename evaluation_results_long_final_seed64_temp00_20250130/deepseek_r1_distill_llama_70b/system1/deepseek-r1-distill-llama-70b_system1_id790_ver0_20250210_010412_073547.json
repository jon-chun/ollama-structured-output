    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk in certain contexts, like criminal behavior, because they might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. Maybe he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, or perhaps the charges were dropped. It's a factor, but not a definitive indicator of high risk on its own.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 175-199 lbs. That's average to slightly above average build. I don't think physical size alone is a strong risk factor unless it's related to something else, like physical aggression, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate independence, but it could also suggest isolation or lack of support systems. Not being married is pretty common at his age, so I'm not sure how much weight to give this.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can be a risk factor for certain outcomes, like employment stability. Without college, he might have fewer opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor. Changing jobs frequently might indicate issues with employment, but at 19, it's also common as people explore different careers or balance work with other responsibilities.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common and not always a high-risk indicator unless it's frequent or problematic. He hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign regarding mental health.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area with a household of five. A stable family background is a protective factor, reducing risk. Rural areas might have different challenges, but overall, a supportive family is a positive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which is generally a protective factor against risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest is a concern, but without a conviction, it's not too severe. His age and job changes are somewhat concerning but not definitive. The protective factors like family, education, and mental health are positives. So, I don't think he's a high risk overall. My confidence is around 70% because there are some factors that could go either way, but the positives outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"age\", \"arrest history\", \"employment instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
