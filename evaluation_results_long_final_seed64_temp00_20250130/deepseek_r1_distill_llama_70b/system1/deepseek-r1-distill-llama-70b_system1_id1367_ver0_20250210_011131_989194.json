    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but I'm not sure how significant they are on their own. Being young might mean less life experience, but it's not a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 1 inch and 230 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, physical size alone isn't a direct risk factor unless it's used in a context that suggests aggression.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can sometimes relate to stability, but alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk. It could mean independence, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor because it might limit job opportunities, leading to higher stress or involvement in other activities. However, this alone isn't definitive.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor as it might indicate financial instability or issues with maintaining responsibilities, which could lead to other problems.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to dependency, impaired judgment, and involvement in criminal activities to obtain drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While mental health issues can be a risk factor, the absence of depression here might actually be a positive sign, unless other mental health issues are present.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban household of four. Living in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates or environmental factors that could influence behavior, but family structure here seems stable with his mother.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests, convictions, drug use, limited education, and unstable employment are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like living situation and religious beliefs might mitigate risk to some extent, the combination of the negative factors leans towards a high-risk assessment. I'm about 85% confident in this prediction because while there are several concerning factors, there are also elements that could reduce the overall risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"limited education\", \"unstable employment\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
