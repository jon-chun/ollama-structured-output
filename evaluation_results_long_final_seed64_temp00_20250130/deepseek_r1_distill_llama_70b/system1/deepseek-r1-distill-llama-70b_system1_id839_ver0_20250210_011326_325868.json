    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male. His age is on the lower side, which might mean he's still developing and could be more impulsive. Being male might also be a factor, though I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a red flag because a criminal history can indicate potential for reoffending. However, it's just one arrest, so maybe it's a minor offense.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and between 150-174 lbs. That seems average, maybe a bit underweight, but not sure how that ties into risk factors unless it's related to health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not living alone could mean he has a support system, which might lower risk, but if he's living with others in a stressful environment, it could have the opposite effect.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can affect opportunities, so not having higher education might limit his options, potentially increasing risk factors like unemployment.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including recidivism or substance abuse.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to dependency, impaired judgment, and involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe's felt down in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can increase risk if left untreated. Mental health problems can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Rural areas might have less access to resources, which could be a risk factor. Living with his mother might provide some stability, but the household size isn't too large, so maybe not overcrowded.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but it depends on the individual. For some, it might mean less social support or different coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, and limited education are all risk factors. However, he has a high school diploma and a stable living situation, which might mitigate some risks. The presence of drug use and mental health issues are strong indicators, so I'm leaning towards high risk. Confidence is around 80% because while several factors point to high risk, some elements like living with family and having a diploma might lower it a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"limited education\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
