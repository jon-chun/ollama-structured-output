    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still a flag.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 230 lbs. His weight could indicate potential health issues, which might relate to other risks, but alone it's not a strong indicator. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 isn't unusual, but it might suggest limited social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not having higher education can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, especially related to employment stability. He's held only one job in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common, but depending on frequency and context, it could be a risk. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign regarding mental health.\n\nHis living situation as a child: lived with non-biological, non-foster/adoptive adults in a rural area. Unstable living conditions in childhood can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes. The household size was 2, which is small, but the key point is the non-biological caregivers, which might indicate instability or lack of support.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest, limited job stability, non-traditional upbringing, and drug use are risk factors. However, the lack of conviction, no recent depression, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The confidence is moderate because while there are several risk factors, there are also protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest history\", \"employment instability\", \"childhood living situation\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
