    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk in certain contexts, like criminal behavior, because they might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. Maybe he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, or perhaps the charges were dropped. It's a factor, but not a definitive indicator of high risk.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 140 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but I don't see how that directly relates to risk factors unless it's about health, but the context here seems more about behavioral or criminal risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate independence, but it could also suggest isolation. Not being married is pretty common at that age, so I don't know if that's a significant factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can be a risk factor for certain outcomes, like employment stability. Not going to college might limit his opportunities, but many people do just fine without it.\n\nHe's held two jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor. Changing jobs frequently might indicate issues with employment, which could relate to other risks like financial instability.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other behavioral problems. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Depression is a risk factor for other issues, so not feeling depressed is good.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Rural areas might have different challenges, but overall, a supportive family is a positive.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, which is generally a protective factor against risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the drug use is a red flag, but the lack of conviction, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs are positives. The job changes and living alone are neutral or mixed. I'm leaning towards this not being a high-risk situation. Maybe moderate risk at most, but not high. So the prediction would be NO, and confidence around 70% because there are some factors that could go either way.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"young male\", \"arrested once\", \"drug use\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
