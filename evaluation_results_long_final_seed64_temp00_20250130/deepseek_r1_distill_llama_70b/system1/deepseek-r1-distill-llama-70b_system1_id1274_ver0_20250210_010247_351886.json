    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher risk behaviors. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law but hasn't been found guilty, which might suggest either a higher risk or perhaps some issues that haven't led to serious consequences yet.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 202 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but without knowing his body composition, it's hard to say if that's a health risk. Maybe not directly related to behavioral risk.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others could mean a support system, which might lower risk factors. Being unmarried at 21 is pretty common, so that's probably not a big issue.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a positive factor, indicating stability and lower risk. However, having held 4 jobs in a year could suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, but marijuana is less severe than harder drugs. He hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can change.\n\nHe grew up with adoptive parents in a large urban household. Adoption itself isn't a risk factor, but a large household might have its own challenges. Believing that God influences his life could provide emotional support, which is positive.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrests and job instability are concerning, but education, lack of depression, and a support system are positives. The drug use is moderate. I'm leaning towards lower risk, but not certain. Maybe a confidence level around 65% for not being high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested twice\", \"held 4 jobs in a year\", \"marijuana use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
