    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female of mixed race. Age and gender might not be significant risk factors on their own, but they can influence other factors. Being young might mean she's still developing and could be more impressionable or facing different life challenges.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could indicate a lower risk since it didn't lead to a guilty verdict. However, the fact that she was arrested at all might suggest some level of involvement in risky behavior or circumstances.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 124 lbs. These are within a normal range, so I don't see any immediate physical risk factors here. Physical health doesn't seem to be a concern based on this information.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and a sense of security. Living with a spouse might reduce certain risks associated with living alone or in unstable environments.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor. It might limit her job opportunities, affect her socioeconomic status, and could lead to financial instability. Without a steady income, she might face more stress or be at risk for other issues.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial difficulties, which in turn can cause stress, mental health issues, or even lead to engaging in risky behaviors out of necessity. This is a red flag because it indicates a possible lack of income and stability.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. This is a positive sign. Drug use is a major risk factor, so her abstinence is a good indicator of lower risk in that area.\n\nShe's felt down in the dumps some of the time in the past month. This could indicate mild depression or anxiety. Mental health issues can be a risk factor if left unaddressed, as they can lead to more severe problems or impact her ability to function in daily life.\n\nShe grew up in a household of size 4. A larger household might have meant more support, but it could also indicate potential overcrowding or shared resources, which might have contributed to stress or other issues during her upbringing.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personal life. This could mean she lacks a support system that religion often provides, such as community, guidance, or coping mechanisms. Alternatively, it might not be a significant factor depending on her personal beliefs and other support systems she has.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be her lack of education, unemployment, and recent feelings of depression. However, she has a stable marriage, no drug use, and only an arrest without conviction. The absence of drug use and a stable living situation are positive factors that might mitigate some risks. Her mental health is a concern but not at a critical level yet. Overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't seem to add up to a high risk scenario. Therefore, the prediction would be low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Lack of education\",\n    \"Unemployment\",\n    \"Recent feelings of depression\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
