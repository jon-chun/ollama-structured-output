    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but no convictions might indicate charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This could be a moderate risk factor because it shows some involvement with the legal system, but not necessarily a pattern of serious offenses.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'0\" and 145 lbs. That's a BMI of around 29, which is just below obese. While health issues could be a concern, I'm not sure how this directly ties to risk assessment unless it's related to other factors like mobility or health-related crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest independence, but it could also indicate a lack of support system. Not being married is common at her age, so this might not be a significant risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment and lack of higher education can be risk factors for things like poverty or criminal activity, as they might limit her opportunities and increase stress or desperation.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. Drug use is a known risk factor, but her abstinence is good. However, she's been feeling down most of the time in the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues, which can be a risk factor for self-harm, suicide, or other negative outcomes.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of five. Living with both parents is generally a positive, but a larger household in an urban area might have its own challenges, like overcrowding or limited resources. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor against negative behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The significant factors are the arrests without convictions, unemployment, lack of education beyond high school, and current depression. These could indicate a higher risk for things like recidivism, mental health issues, or socioeconomic challenges. However, the absence of drug use and a supportive religious belief might mitigate some risks. The confidence level is moderate because while there are concerning factors, there are also positive elements that might lower the overall risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests without convictions\", \"unemployment\", \"lack of higher education\", \"depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
