    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk for certain behaviors, but age alone isn't the only factor. He's White, but I don't think race is a significant factor here unless it's related to socioeconomic status, which isn't mentioned.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. That's a red flag because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 230 lbs. That's a large build, which might be relevant in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but on its own, it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest some level of instability or lack of support system, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky or criminal activities due to fewer options.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor as it might indicate financial instability or issues with commitment, which can lead to other problems.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to other risky behaviors. Using drugs in the past month, especially all the time, is concerning and could indicate dependency or addiction.\n\nHe's felt down for the past month, which suggests possible depression. Mental health issues can increase risk, especially if left untreated. Depression can lead to substance abuse as a form of self-medication.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of four when young. A stable family environment usually is a protective factor, so this might lower the risk a bit, but other factors might outweigh this.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means he doesn't have a support system, but it's not as significant as other factors here.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, convictions, drug use, mental health issues, lack of education, unstable employment, and living alone all point towards high risk. The stable family background might help, but the other factors are more impactful. So, I'd predict high risk with high confidence, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Drug use\", \"Mental health issues\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unstable employment\", \"Living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
