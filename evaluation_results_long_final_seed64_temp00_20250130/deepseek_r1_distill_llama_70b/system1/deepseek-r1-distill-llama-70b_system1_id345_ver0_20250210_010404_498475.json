    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive factor on its own. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, although it depends on the nature of the offense.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 128 lbs. I'm not sure how height and weight directly relate to risk factors unless it's about physical health, but that's probably not the main concern here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor for various negative outcomes. Not being married at a young age isn't necessarily a risk factor, but combined with living alone, it might suggest limited social ties.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can impact opportunities and stability, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit future prospects, but again, not a direct risk indicator.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor as it might indicate issues with employment retention, which can lead to financial instability or other stressors.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. However, since it's not specified as heavy use, it's a moderate concern.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but the absence here is good.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is generally a protective factor, reducing risk. Rural areas might have different challenges, but overall, this is a positive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks by promoting positive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest and conviction are the most concerning factors. However, other factors like stable upbringing, education, and lack of depression are positives. The job instability and drug use are moderate concerns. Considering all, I think the risk is present but not extremely high. So, I'll predict \"YES\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once and convicted\", \"held 4 jobs in a year\", \"used marijuana in the past four years\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
