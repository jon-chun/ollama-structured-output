    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some risk, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'5\" and 130 lbs. That's a bit below average but not significantly underweight. Physical build alone isn't a strong risk factor unless it's extreme, which it doesn't seem to be here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 21 isn't unusual, especially these days. Not being married could relate to social support, but again, not a major risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors or instability.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other underlying problems. This could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor. Cocaine, in particular, can be more concerning than marijuana because of its higher potential for addiction and legal issues. This is a strong indicator.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Current mental health isn't indicating a risk here.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. Living with both parents is generally a positive, but a household size of seven might indicate overcrowding or financial stress. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might expose him to more risks.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could relate to his support system or coping mechanisms. Lack of religious affiliation might not be a direct risk, but it could mean he doesn't have that particular support system.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education, limited employment, and drug use are the main concerns. These factors can contribute to higher risk behaviors or instability. However, the absence of depression and living with both parents are positive points. The arrest without conviction is a bit of a wildcard but not the most significant factor.\n\nI think the risk is present, especially considering the drug use and educational background, but it's not extremely high. So, I'd predict \"YES\" for high risk but with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"lack of education\", \"limited employment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
