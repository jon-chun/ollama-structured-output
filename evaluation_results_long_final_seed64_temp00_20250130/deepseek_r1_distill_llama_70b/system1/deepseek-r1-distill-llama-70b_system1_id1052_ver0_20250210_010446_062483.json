    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could indicate some risk, but it's not a strong indicator alone.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'9\" and 199 lbs. That's a BMI around 29, which is just below obese. Health issues could be a risk factor, but without knowing if he has any health problems, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate independence, but it could also mean limited social support. Not being married at 20 isn't unusual, so this might not be a significant risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant risk factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might lead to financial instability or involvement in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial stress or other underlying problems. This could be a risk factor.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or interferes with daily life. However, occasional use might not be as significant.\n\nNot feeling depressed in the past month. This is a positive factor. Current mental health is good, which might lower the risk.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of five when young. Growing up in a larger household might mean more support, but it could also indicate overcrowding or financial stress. Not sure how much this contributes to risk.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. This could provide emotional support and reduce risk factors, as religious beliefs can offer stability.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of education and job instability are significant risk factors. However, the absence of depression and having a religious support system might mitigate some risks. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. Overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't strongly indicate a high risk. So, I'd predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"age\", \"gender\", \"ethnicity\", \"arrest_history\", \"education_level\", \"employment_history\", \"substance_use\", \"living_situation\", \"family_background\", \"religious_beliefs\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
