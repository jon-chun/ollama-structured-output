    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but race isn't typically a direct indicator. Being young might mean he's still developing and could be more impulsive, but that's not definitive.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might mean the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty, so this could be a lower risk factor. However, the fact that he was arrested at all could indicate some level of involvement in risky behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 204 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but unless there's a specific reason related to health or behavior, this might not be a significant risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 20 is pretty common, so that's not a big deal. Not living alone could mean he has a support system, which might lower risk, but it could also mean he's in an environment that's not stable.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. A GED is equivalent to a high school diploma, so that's not a negative. Not being in college could mean he's working or pursuing other interests, which isn't inherently risky.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with commitment or behavioral problems, which might be a risk factor. However, at 20, people often explore different careers, so this could be normal.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more severe issues. Recent use within the past four years suggests ongoing behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Depression can be a risk factor for other issues, but not feeling depressed is good.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a large household in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a large household might mean less individual attention, and urban areas can have higher crime rates, which could expose him to more risks. However, living with his biological mother is a stable family structure.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are the drug use and job instability. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. The rest of the factors are either neutral or not strongly indicative of high risk. So, while there are some risk factors, they might not be severe enough to indicate a high risk overall. Therefore, the prediction would be NO, with a moderate confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"drug use\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
