Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. So, that's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are significant risk factors because they indicate past involvement in criminal activity, which could suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 2 inches and 275 lbs. While this might make him stand out, physical size alone isn't a direct risk factor unless it's used in a context that suggests aggression, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, which might lower risk as it indicates a support system and responsibility.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment history can be a stabilizing factor, but having two jobs might indicate instability or transient employment, which could be a risk factor if it shows an inability to maintain steady work.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to dependency, impaired judgment, and involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of depression is a positive factor, as mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, but urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could be a risk factor depending on the environment.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective factors against risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors are the arrests, convictions, and drug use. However, he has several protective factors like marriage, stable upbringing, and employment. The drug use is a strong indicator, but the presence of stabilizing factors might mitigate the overall risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests\", \"convictions\", \"drug_use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
