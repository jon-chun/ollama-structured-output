    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male from an American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut background. I know that certain demographics can face systemic challenges, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to risk without more context.\n\nHe's been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which suggests a history of engaging in criminal behavior. This is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 180 lbs. His physical build doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor unless it's related to specific behaviors, but on its own, it's neutral.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate a lack of strong social support, which might contribute to higher risk factors, but it's not definitive.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors due to fewer options.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of criminal activity as a means to cope.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana use is common and legal in some areas, frequent use could impair judgment and contribute to other risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can fluctuate, so it's something to consider but not a direct risk factor here.\n\nHe grew up in a household of 8. A large family might indicate overcrowding or less individual attention, which can contribute to behavioral issues, but it's not a clear-cut risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could provide a sense of purpose or support, which might be protective against risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests and convictions are the most concerning factors. The lack of education and employment are also significant. However, the absence of recent depression and a belief system might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors could go either way.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unemployment\", \"Drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
