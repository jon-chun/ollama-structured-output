    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but without convictions, it's unclear if he's committed serious offenses. It's a point to consider but not definitive.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a risk factor. Being unmarried and living alone at 21 is pretty common, so that's not a big issue.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could indicate lower educational attainment, which might relate to socioeconomic factors or opportunities, possibly increasing certain risks.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor for various issues, including financial instability or involvement in other activities out of necessity or boredom.\n\nHe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for health issues, legal problems, and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe's felt down a lot in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which can increase risk of self-harm, substance abuse, or other negative outcomes.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments might have different challenges, but without more info, it's hard to assess. Household size isn't directly a risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: unemployment, lack of education, drug use, and mental health issues are significant risk factors. The arrests without convictions are a concern but not as severe. The mental health aspect, combined with drug use, could indicate a higher risk for negative outcomes. However, without more context on the arrests, it's not a certainty. Confidence is high because several factors point to elevated risk, but not 100% because some elements are unclear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"unemployment\", \"lack of education\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"arrests without conviction\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
