    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Next, he's been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions can indicate a history of criminal behavior, which might suggest higher risk.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 185 lbs. His physical build doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor unless it's related to specific behaviors, but I don't see that here. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can be linked to higher risk factors, as it might limit job opportunities and increase stress or involvement in other activities. He's held five jobs in a year, which suggests instability. Job instability can be a risk factor for financial issues or other problems.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more severe issues. He's felt down in the past month, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Mental health can be a risk factor if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. While living with both parents is generally positive, a large household in an urban area might have its own challenges, like limited resources or exposure to higher-risk environments.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor, providing support and reducing certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together: the history of arrests, convictions, drug use, job instability, lack of education, and possible mental health issues all point towards higher risk factors. However, his religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. So, I'm leaning towards high risk but not with absolute certainty. Maybe a confidence level around 80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"job instability\", \"lack of education\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year.
