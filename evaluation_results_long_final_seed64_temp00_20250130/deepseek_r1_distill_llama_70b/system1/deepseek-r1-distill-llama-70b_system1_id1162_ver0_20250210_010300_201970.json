    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean she's had some issues, but it's not a strong indicator of high risk since it didn't lead to a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that's not a risk factor. She's never been married and doesn't live alone. Living situation might affect support systems, but not necessarily a direct risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can impact opportunities, but again, not a direct risk indicator. She's held one job in the past year, which could indicate some instability, but it's not a major red flag.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues, health problems, and impaired judgment.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Depression can be a risk factor, but its absence is a good sign.\n\nHer living situation as a child with non-biological adults in an urban area might suggest some instability or exposure to higher-risk environments. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. This could relate to her support systems or coping mechanisms. Lack of religious belief might not be a risk factor on its own, but it could indicate a different support system.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the drug use and possibly the unstable living situation as a child. However, she hasn't been convicted, isn't currently depressed, and has some level of employment. The drug use is concerning, but without more severe indicators like convictions or current mental health issues, the overall risk might not be extremely high.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so the prediction would be \"YES\" for high risk, but the confidence isn't extremely high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"arrest history\", \"unstable living situation as a child\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
