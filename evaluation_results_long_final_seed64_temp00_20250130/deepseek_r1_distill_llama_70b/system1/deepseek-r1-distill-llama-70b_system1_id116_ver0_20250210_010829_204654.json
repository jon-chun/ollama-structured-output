    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive indicator on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest that he was involved in some kind of incident, but since there was no conviction, it might not be as severe. However, it's still a point to consider.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs. His physical build doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor unless it's related to physical strength in a criminal context, but that's speculative.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of strong family support, which could be a risk factor if he doesn't have a support system.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a positive factor, as it can lead to better opportunities and stability. So this might lower his risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having some employment history is positive, showing responsibility, which could lower risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common and not as high risk as other substances, but it can still be a factor depending on frequency and context.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. This is a positive sign as mental health issues can sometimes increase risk factors.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in a household of five in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban area can have its challenges, but having a biological parent present is a stabilizing factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support, which might be a protective factor for some, but it's not directly a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrest is a concern, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. His education and employment are positives. Drug use is present but not extreme. His living situation and family background are neutral to positive. So overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't strongly indicate a high risk. Therefore, the prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"marijuana use\", \"lives alone\", \"young age\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
