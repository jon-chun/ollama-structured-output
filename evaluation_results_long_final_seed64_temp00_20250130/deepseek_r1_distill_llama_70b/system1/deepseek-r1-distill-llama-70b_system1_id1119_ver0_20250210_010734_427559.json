    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested six times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but no formal charges stuck. This might indicate either a pattern of behavior or perhaps issues with the legal system, but without convictions, it's a bit unclear.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'2\" and 140 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height. This could indicate possible health issues, maybe neglect or other underlying problems.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 22 isn't unusual, but combined with no marriage, it might suggest social isolation or limited support networks.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher risks of unemployment, poverty, and potentially criminal activity if other options are limited.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including mental health issues or substance abuse.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used them all the time in the past month. This indicates a possible substance abuse issue, which is a major risk factor for health problems, legal issues, and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe's felt down for the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health problems are risk factors for self-harm, substance abuse, and other negative outcomes.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size four. Larger household size can sometimes relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to assess. It might mean more siblings, which could be neutral or a stressor depending on the environment.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support or a sense of purpose, which might mitigate some risks.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of education, unemployment, recent drug use, and mental health issues are strong indicators of high risk. The arrests without convictions add some concern but aren't as definitive. His belief in God might help, but the other factors are more pressing. So, I think the prediction is YES, and confidence is around 85% because most factors point to high risk, but some elements like the lack of convictions and possible religious support might slightly lower confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 22\",\n    \"Gender: Male\",\n    \"Race: Black\",\n    \"Arrests: 6 (no convictions)\",\n    \"Height: 6'2\\\"\",\n    \"Weight: 140 lbs\",\n    \"Marital Status: Never married\",\n    \"Living Situation: Alone\",\n    \"Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\",\n    \"Employment: No jobs held in the past year\",\n    \"Drug Use: Marijuana and cocaine use in the past four years, frequent use in the past month\",\n    \"Mental Health: Felt down in the dumps for the past month\",\n    \"Family Background: Lived in a household of size 4 at a young age\",\n    \"Religious Beliefs: Believes God influences personal events\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
