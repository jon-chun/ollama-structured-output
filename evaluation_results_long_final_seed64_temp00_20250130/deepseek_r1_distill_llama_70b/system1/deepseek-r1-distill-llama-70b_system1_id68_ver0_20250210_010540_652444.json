    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal record can impact future behavior and opportunities.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 130 lbs. Physical characteristics don't typically correlate with risk behavior, so I can probably set that aside. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, but it might indicate some level of independence or possible isolation, which could be a factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor because it might limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. She's held three jobs in a year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another potential risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a clear risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more severe issues. She's also experienced feelings of being down, which could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase risk, especially if left untreated.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size three at a young age. A stable family environment can be protective, but without more details, it's hard to assess. She doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life, which might affect her support system or coping mechanisms, but this is more subjective.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, lack of education, job instability, drug use, and possible mental health issues all point towards higher risk factors. However, she's young, so there's potential for intervention and change. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors could be addressed with support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
