    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, especially if the convictions are recent or related to serious offenses. However, I don't know the nature of the crimes, which could affect the assessment.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 140 lbs. Physical characteristics don't usually correlate with risk factors unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of risky behavior. Marriage often indicates some level of stability and support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can impact opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit future prospects, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment stability is important. Having only one job could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might increase risk factors related to financial stress or recidivism.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be a risk factor. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, and if it's not current or problematic, the risk might be lower.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, but the absence of recent depression is a positive sign.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Growing up in an urban area might have its challenges, but with both parents, it's a positive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior and social connections.\n\nPutting it all together: The multiple arrests and convictions are concerning, but he has several protective factors like marriage, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs. Employment stability is a bit shaky, and past drug use is a minor concern. Without knowing the severity of his criminal history, I'm leaning towards moderate risk. So, prediction is YES, but confidence isn't extremely high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"past drug use\", \"limited job stability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
