    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but race isn't typically a direct indicator. So, I don't think race is a significant factor here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, especially if they're related to serious offenses. However, without knowing the nature of the arrests, it's a bit tricky, but it's still a red flag.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 4 inches and 190 lbs. That's on the taller and leaner side, but physical attributes alone don't usually indicate risk unless in specific contexts, like sports injuries or something else, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can sometimes relate to stability. Living alone might indicate independence, but it could also suggest isolation, which can be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Educational attainment can affect job prospects and stability. Not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities, which could contribute to risk factors like unemployment or financial instability.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability is a significant risk factor. Frequent job changes can indicate issues with employment, which might relate to reliability, behavior, or other underlying issues.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more severe issues. This definitely increases the risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign, but mental health can fluctuate, so it's something to monitor, but not an immediate risk.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a larger household in an urban setting might have its challenges, but without more details on the family environment, it's hard to assess. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might influence behavior, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing support and structure, which might lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors are the arrests, convictions, job instability, and drug use. These are strong indicators that could point to a higher risk. However, the absence of depression and having a religious belief might mitigate some of that risk. So, I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but not with complete certainty. Maybe around 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests\", \"convictions\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
