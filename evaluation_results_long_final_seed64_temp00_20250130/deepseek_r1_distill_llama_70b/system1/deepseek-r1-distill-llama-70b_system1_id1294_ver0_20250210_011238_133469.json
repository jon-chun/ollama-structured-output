    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. Age and race can sometimes be factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without other factors, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might not be a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. This could be a moderate risk factor because it shows some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 185 lbs. That's pretty average, so I don't see this as a significant risk factor either way.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, especially these days. Not being married at a young age doesn't necessarily point to high risk. It's more about personal circumstances than a risk indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Having an education is a positive, but not pursuing higher education could limit opportunities. However, it's not a direct risk factor unless combined with other issues.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor. It might indicate issues with employment, which could relate to reliability or other underlying problems. This is a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common. However, any drug use can be a risk factor depending on frequency and impact on life. Since it's marijuana and not harder drugs, it's a lower risk but still something to note.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. This is a positive indicator. Lack of recent depression suggests better mental health, which is a protective factor against high risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five when young. A stable family environment with biological parents is generally a positive. Household size might mean less individual attention, but it's not a strong risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior and social connections.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest without conviction and job instability are moderate risk factors. Drug use is a minor one. However, the presence of a high school diploma, stable family background, and religious beliefs are protective factors. Recent mental health is good. So overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't add up to a high risk. The confidence is around 65% because there are some concerns but not enough to push it into high risk territory.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"held 4 jobs in a year\", \"past drug use (marijuana)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
