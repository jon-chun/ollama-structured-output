    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male. Age can be a factor, but 22 isn't particularly high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 225-249 lbs. While being overweight can have health implications, I'm not sure how directly that ties to risk assessment in this context. Maybe it's more about health risks rather than behavioral.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 22 isn't unusual, but living situation might affect stability. Not living alone could mean he has family support, which might be a protective factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, as education often provides stability and opportunities.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher risk behaviors or financial instability.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential risk, especially if it's recent. Cocaine, in particular, can be associated with more serious issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can fluctuate. Living with both biological parents in an urban area as a child might have provided stability, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor as it might provide a sense of purpose or community support.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, drug use, and job instability are significant risk factors. However, having a supportive family and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a prediction of \"YES\" with around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"drug use\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
