    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race can sometimes be factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without other factors, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but since there were no convictions, it's not as severe. It's something to note but not a major red flag.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 170 lbs. That's on the taller side but underweight for his height. Maybe indicates he's not as physically strong, but not directly a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 21 isn't unusual, and not being married at this age is common. No clear risk here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college isn't a risk factor by itself.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job stability is important, but one job in a year could just mean he's starting his career or changing fields. Not necessarily a risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a positive sign. No substance abuse and good mental health are good indicators.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five. Larger families can sometimes have more stress, but it's not a direct risk factor. It depends on other dynamics, which we don't have info on.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and structure, which is generally a positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the factors here are neutral or positive. The arrests are a concern but without convictions, they don't pose a high risk. His mental health and lack of substance abuse are positives. So overall, the risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested 2 times\", \"living alone\", \"held 1 job\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
