    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested three times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. I don't see how her physical characteristics directly relate to risk factors unless it's about health, but that's not indicated here. Being married and living with her spouse could be a stabilizing factor, which might lower risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can impact opportunities, but not having more education doesn't necessarily mean high risk. She's held one job during the year, which might indicate some instability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues. She's felt down several times in the past month, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Mental health struggles can increase risk if not properly managed.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults in a large household as a child. Unstable living conditions can contribute to higher risk factors, as they might indicate a challenging upbringing. Finally, she believes God influences her life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: her criminal history, recent drug use, mental health issues, and unstable childhood are significant risk factors. However, being married and having a high school diploma might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but I'm not entirely certain because some factors are conflicting.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"unstable childhood\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
