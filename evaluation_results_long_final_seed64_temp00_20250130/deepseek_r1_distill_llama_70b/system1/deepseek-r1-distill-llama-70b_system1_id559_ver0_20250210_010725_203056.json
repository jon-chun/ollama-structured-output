    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk in certain contexts, like criminal behavior, because they might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure how much weight to give this alone.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 215 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, I'm not sure if physical size alone is a strong indicator of risk. It might depend on the context, like if he's involved in violent crimes, but that's not specified here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for various negative outcomes. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against certain risks. Not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially increasing the risk of unemployment or other issues.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher risk factors like financial instability or behavioral problems.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some recent use. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other substance use or dependency. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so the risk might be moderate.\n\nHe sometimes feels down and unmotivated. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can increase risk factors for self-harm, substance abuse, or other negative behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of seven. A crowded living environment might have contributed to stress or lack of attention, which could be a risk factor for behavioral issues.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which might lower certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. The mental health concerns and drug use add to that. However, his education level and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The job instability and living alone are neutral to slightly negative factors.\n\nI think the combination of criminal history, mental health issues, and drug use leans towards a high risk prediction. But considering his education and religious beliefs, the confidence isn't extremely high. Maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"mental health concerns\", \"drug use\", \"job instability\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
