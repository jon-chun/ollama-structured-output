    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male. Age can be a factor, but 22 isn't particularly high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested six times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because multiple arrests and a conviction can indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 170 lbs. Physical characteristics don't usually contribute much to risk assessment unless there's something specific, which there isn't here. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but it's not a direct indicator. He hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor as it might lead to financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues and other risky behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign because mental health issues can also contribute to risk.\n\nHis living situation as a child was with non-biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a rural area. Unstable or non-traditional living arrangements in childhood can be a risk factor for future issues. Lastly, he doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a factor, but it's not as significant as others.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests, convictions, unemployment, drug use, and unstable childhood are strong indicators. However, the absence of recent depression might slightly lower the risk. I'm leaning towards high risk but not with complete certainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"unstable childhood living situation\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
