    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs between 175-199 lbs. Physical characteristics alone don't usually indicate risk unless in specific contexts, which aren't mentioned here. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a protective factor, as it can lead to better opportunities and stability. He's held two jobs in the past year, which shows some employment stability, though frequent job changes can sometimes be a concern.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be a risk factor, but marijuana is less severe than other substances. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, so this is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor. Believing that God influences his life might provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and conviction, and the drug use. However, he has several protective factors like education, employment, stable upbringing, and mental well-being. The presence of protective factors might mitigate the risks associated with his criminal history and drug use. Therefore, while there are some risk factors, they might not be high enough to classify him as high risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested and convicted\", \"drug use (marijuana)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
