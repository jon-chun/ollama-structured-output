    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to societal factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This might not be a strong indicator of high risk since it didn't lead to a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 158 lbs. That's within a normal BMI range, so no health red flags there.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 22 isn't unusual, and not being married at this age is pretty common. These don't seem like significant risk factors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. While higher education can sometimes correlate with lower risk factors, having a diploma is still a positive. Holding three jobs in a year could indicate instability, but it could also mean she's exploring different opportunities.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Recent feelings of being down could indicate some mental health issues, but it's noted as \"some of the time,\" not persistent. She grew up in a small household, which might have provided more attention, but again, not a clear risk factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can be a coping mechanism and a positive factor in mental health.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors don't point to high risk. The job changes and occasional sadness are minor concerns, but overall, the risk seems low. So, I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"age\", \"arrest history\", \"employment history\", \"mental health\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 2. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
