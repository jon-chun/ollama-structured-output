    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black female. Age and race might not be direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to inexperience or impulsivity, but that's not necessarily a strong indicator here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean the charges were dropped or dismissed, which might lower the risk compared to a conviction. However, the fact that she was arrested could still be a concern depending on the circumstances.\n\nHer height and weight (5'6\", 110 lbs) don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment unless it's related to physical health, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, suggesting support and less likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can impact opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might not be a risk factor unless it's due to other issues.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment history can indicate stability. Two jobs might suggest she's working but perhaps not consistently, which could be a neutral factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive indicator. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, and her abstinence is a good sign.\n\nShe's felt down some of the time in the past month. This could indicate mild depression or stress, but it's not at a severity that suggests a high risk unless it's persistent or severe.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. A stable family structure with biological parents is a protective factor, though urban environments can have higher crime rates, which might pose some risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Spiritual beliefs can provide emotional support and reduce risk factors by promoting resilience and positive coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some positive factors like stable marriage, employment, no drug use, and a supportive upbringing. The arrest without conviction and occasional feelings of sadness are concerns but not severe enough to indicate high risk. Her overall profile leans towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"occasional feelings of sadness\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year.
