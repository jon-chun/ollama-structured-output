    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still a flag.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 165 lbs. His height and weight don't immediately stand out as risk factors unless we're considering something specific, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest independence, but it could also indicate a lack of strong family support, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not having higher education can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, especially in terms of socioeconomic status or future opportunities.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or interferes with daily life. However, since it's only mentioned as past use, it might not be a current issue.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. This is a positive sign, as it suggests he's not currently experiencing mental health issues that could contribute to risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but living with both parents might mitigate that.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behavior and social connections.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors here are the arrest, job instability, and past drug use. However, the lack of conviction, stable family background, and religious beliefs are protective factors. The absence of depression and having a GED are also positives. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't seem to add up to a high risk overall. Therefore, the prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"past drug use\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
