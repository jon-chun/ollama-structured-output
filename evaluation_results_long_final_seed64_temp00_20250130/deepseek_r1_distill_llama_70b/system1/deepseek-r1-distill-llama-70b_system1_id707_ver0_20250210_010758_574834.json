    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive factor on its own. Next, he's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, so that's a significant risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 145 lbs. His height and weight might not directly relate to risk, unless considering physical strength, but that's speculative. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk factors, but it's not a strong indicator.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor as education can reduce risk. However, he hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor as it might lead to financial instability or idleness, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe has used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues and health problems. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five, which is a larger family size. While larger families can sometimes have more stress, it's not a direct risk factor. He believes God has a role in his life, which might provide emotional support and reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors are his criminal history, unemployment, and drug use. These factors are strong indicators, but he's also in school, which is a protective factor. The absence of depression is also positive. Considering all these, I would predict a high risk but with moderate confidence because there are both risk and protective factors present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
