    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs 115 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically indicate risk unless there's something unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor for certain behaviors or mental health issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but again, not a direct risk factor. She's held three jobs in a year, which could suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor for financial instability or other issues.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. However, she's been feeling down most of the time in the past month, which indicates possible depression or mental health struggles. Mental health issues can be a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have different challenges, but without more context, it's hard to assess. She believes God has a role in her life, which can be a source of support, but if taken to an extreme, could potentially be a risk factor, though that's less common.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are her recent feelings of depression and job instability. These could indicate a higher risk for mental health issues or other related problems. However, the absence of drug use and a conviction, along with having a high school diploma, are positive factors that might lower the overall risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not extremely high. So, the prediction would be \"YES\" because there are some risk factors present, but the confidence isn't very high because there are also mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"job instability\", \"recent feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
