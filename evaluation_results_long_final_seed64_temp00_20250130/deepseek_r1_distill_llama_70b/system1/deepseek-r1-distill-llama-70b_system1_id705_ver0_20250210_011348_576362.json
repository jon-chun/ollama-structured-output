    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 165 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and isn't living alone. Not living alone could mean he has a support system, which is a positive factor. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is moderate, which is neutral.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job stability can be a factor; only having one job might indicate some instability, but it's not a major red flag. He hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive because substance abuse and mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four, which is a typical family size and doesn't indicate neglect or overcrowding. He believes God influences his personal events, which might provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are neutral or positive. The arrest is a concern but without a conviction, it's less severe. Overall, the risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": {\n    \"age\": 22,\n    \"gender\": \"male\",\n    \"race\": \"White\",\n    \"arrests\": 1,\n    \"convictions\": 0,\n    \"height\": \"5 feet 9 inches\",\n    \"weight\": 165,\n    \"marital_status\": \"never married\",\n    \"living_situation\": \"not living alone\",\n    \"education\": \"high school diploma\",\n    \"college_enrollment\": false,\n    \"jobs_held\": 1,\n    \"drug_use\": false,\n    \"depression\": false,\n    \"household_size\": 4,\n    \"religiosity\": \"believes God influences personal events\"\n  },\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
