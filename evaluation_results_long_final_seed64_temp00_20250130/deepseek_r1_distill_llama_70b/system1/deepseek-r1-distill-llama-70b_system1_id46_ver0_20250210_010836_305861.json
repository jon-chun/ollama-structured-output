    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still a flag.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs 287 lbs. That's a high BMI, which could indicate health issues, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk assessment unless it's related to other behaviors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate social isolation, which can sometimes be a risk factor, but not necessarily on its own. Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college could point to lower educational attainment, which might be linked to economic instability or other issues.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, possibly indicating difficulties in maintaining employment, which might relate to other areas of life.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. That's positive; substance use and mental health issues are often significant risk factors, so their absence is a good sign.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have different challenges, but without more context, it's hard to say. His belief that God isn't involved in his life might relate to coping mechanisms or support systems, but again, not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are the arrest, lack of education, job instability, and living alone. However, the absence of drug use and recent depression are positives. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not high. So, prediction is NO with maybe 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"no high school diploma\", \"job instability\", \"lives alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
