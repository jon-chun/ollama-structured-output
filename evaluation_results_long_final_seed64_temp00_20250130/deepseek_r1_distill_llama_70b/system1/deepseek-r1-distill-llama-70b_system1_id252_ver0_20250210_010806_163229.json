    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male of Asian/Pacific Islander descent. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but I don't think they're significant here on their own.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has been convicted. That's a red flag because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or other risky behaviors.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'7\" and 230 lbs. That gives him a high BMI, which might indicate obesity. Obesity can lead to health issues, which could be a risk factor for certain behaviors or outcomes, but I'm not sure how directly it ties to the kind of risk we're assessing here.\n\nHe's married but living alone. That's a bit unusual. Maybe indicating some relationship issues or instability, which could contribute to risk factors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lower educational attainment can be associated with higher risk of unemployment, lower income, and potentially other social issues that might increase risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other stressors that could increase risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive factor, as drug use is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes. So this might lower the overall risk.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps some of the time in the past month. That could indicate depression or low mental health, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of 11. A large family size might indicate a stressful or overcrowded living environment in childhood, which can be a risk factor for behavioral issues or other problems.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal happenings. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing support and reducing risk, but it can vary depending on how it's applied personally.\n\nPutting it all together: the criminal history is a strong indicator, as is the mental health issue. However, the absence of drug use and religious beliefs might mitigate some risk. The educational and employment factors are neutral to slightly negative. The living situation is a bit concerning but not a major factor.\n\nI think the criminal history and mental health issues are significant enough to lean towards a high risk prediction, but the confidence isn't extremely high because there are mitigating factors like no drug use and religious beliefs. So maybe a prediction of YES with around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"mental health issues\", \"educational attainment\", \"employment instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
