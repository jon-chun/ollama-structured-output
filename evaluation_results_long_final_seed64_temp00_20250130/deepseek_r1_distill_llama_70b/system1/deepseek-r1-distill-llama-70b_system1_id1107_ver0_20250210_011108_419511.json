    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher risk behaviors. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily guilty. That's a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs 280 lbs. His weight could indicate health issues, which might relate to other risks, but not directly a behavioral risk. Being married and living with his spouse could be a stabilizing factor, which might lower risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower socioeconomic status. He's held five jobs in a year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor.\n\nHe used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially for recidivism or other negative outcomes. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Growing up in a household of seven in an urban area with both biological parents might have provided some stability, but a large household could also mean limited resources or attention.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education, job instability, and drug use are concerning. However, being married, living with his spouse, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The arrests without convictions are a bit of a mixed signal. Overall, I think the risk is present but not extremely high. So, I'll predict \"YES\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 19 years old\",\n    \"Gender: Male\",\n    \"Ethnicity: Hispanic\",\n    \"Arrests: 2 times (no convictions)\",\n    \"Height: 5 feet 8 inches\",\n    \"Weight: 280 lbs\",\n    \"Marital Status: Married, living with spouse\",\n    \"Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\",\n    \"Employment: Held 5 jobs in the past year\",\n    \"Drug Use: Cocaine use in the past four years\",\n    \"Mental Health: No depression in the past month\",\n    \"Family Background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 7 in an urban area\",\n    \"Religious Beliefs: Believes God influences personal events\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
