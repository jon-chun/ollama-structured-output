    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 135 lbs. That's a healthy weight, so no issues there. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of support system, which could be a risk factor depending on other circumstances.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally a positive factor, so this might lower her risk. However, she hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can sometimes correlate with higher risk, especially if it's a long-term situation, but she's in college, so it might be expected.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more serious issues. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area in a small household. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so that's good. She believes God has something to do with her life, which can provide emotional support and reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and drug use. However, the lack of conviction, stable upbringing, education, and mental well-being are positive. So, while there are some risks, they aren't overwhelming. I'd say the overall prediction is low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"unemployed\", \"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
