    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk in certain contexts, like criminal behavior, because they might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure how significant age is here.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are definitely risk factors. They indicate past involvement in criminal activity, which could suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 165 lbs. I don't think height and weight are strong indicators of risk. Maybe in some contexts, but not generally.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower income, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate financial instability, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, impaired judgment, and involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase risk, but the absence here might lower it a bit.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Stable family environment is a protective factor, which might lower risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but living with both parents could mitigate that.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, as religion can provide a support system and moral framework.\n\nPutting it all together: arrests, convictions, drug use, job instability, and living alone are significant risk factors. However, stable upbringing and lack of current depression are protective. I'm leaning towards high risk because the negative factors are quite strong, but I'm not 100% confident. Maybe around 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests\", \"convictions\", \"drug_use\", \"job_instability\", \"living_alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
