    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being Black alone isn't a risk factor\u2014it's more about systemic issues. Next, he's been arrested five times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate some involvement with the law, but without convictions, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 165 lbs, which is average, so no risk there. He's never been married and not living alone. Living situation might affect support systems, but not directly a risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education level can impact opportunities and stability, which might be a risk factor for unemployment or other issues. He hasn't held any jobs in the past year, which could indicate instability or lack of employment history, which is a risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and not as high risk as other drugs, but any drug use can be a factor. He hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health might not be an immediate concern.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Larger households might have more stress, and urban areas can have higher crime rates, which could be a risk factor. He doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life, which might affect his support system or outlook, but not directly a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, and living in a high-risk area are significant. However, no convictions, no recent depression, and only marijuana use are mitigating factors. So, I'd say there's a moderate risk, maybe around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests\", \"lack of education\", \"unemployment\", \"urban residence\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
