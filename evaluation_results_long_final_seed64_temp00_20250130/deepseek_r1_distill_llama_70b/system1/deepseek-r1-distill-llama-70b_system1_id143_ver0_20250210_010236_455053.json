Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old White female. Age and gender aren't necessarily risk factors on their own, but being young might relate to other factors like impulsivity or life stage.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean she's had a run-in with the law, but it didn't lead to a guilty verdict. This might indicate some risk, but it's not as severe as a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'7\" and 155 lbs. These are within a normal range and don't pose a health risk on their own.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate independence, but it might also suggest a lack of social support, which can be a risk factor for mental health issues.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree but isn't enrolled in college now. Education is generally a protective factor, so having a degree is positive. Not being in college might mean she's working or taking a break, which isn't necessarily a risk.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more severe issues.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors for various negative outcomes.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, but urban environments can have higher crime rates and other stressors.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk if it means she lacks a support system, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nPutting it all together: the drug use and mental health issues are significant risks. The job instability and arrest are moderate risks. Her education and stable upbringing are protective. So, overall, there are notable risk factors, but they might not be at the highest level. I'd predict a moderate risk, so the prediction is YES, but confidence isn't extremely high, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"job instability\", \"arrest history\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has completed a Bachelor's degree and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
