    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each factor provided and assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) based on its potential impact on recidivism risk. Then, I'll use these factors collectively to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\nLet's break down the analysis step-by-step:\n\n1. Demographic factors:\n   - Age: 22\n   - Race: White\n   - Height and weight: 5'11\" (180 cm), 225-249 lbs (102-113 kg)\n\n2. Criminal history:\n   - Arrested once\n   - Convicted\n\n3. Education and employment:\n   - GED certificate\n   - Not enrolled in college\n   - Held one job during the year\n\n4. Family and living situation:\n   - Never married\n   - Currently not living alone\n   - Lived with both biological parents at a young age\n\n5. Substance use and mental health:\n   - Used marijuana and cocaine in past four years\n   - No depression reported over the past month\n\n6. Religious beliefs:\n   - Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nNow, let's assign weights and reasoning for each factor:\n\n1. Demographic factors: Medium risk\n   Reasoning: While age is relatively young (22), which could increase risk, race and physical characteristics are not typically strong predictors of recidivism.\n\n2. Criminal history: High risk\n   Reasoning: Previous arrest and conviction significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\n3. Education and employment:\n   a) GED certificate: Low risk\n      Reasoning: Having a GED suggests some level of educational achievement, which can be protective against recidivism.\n   \n   b) Not enrolled in college: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Lack of higher education may limit job opportunities and increase stress.\n\n   c) Held one job during the year: High risk\n      Reasoning: Unstable employment history is a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\n4. Family and living situation:\n   a) Never married: Medium risk\n      Reasoning: Lack of stable family structure can contribute to higher risk.\n   \n   b) Currently not living alone: Low risk\n      Reasoning: Living with others may provide some level of support and accountability.\n   \n   c) Lived with both biological parents at a young age: Low risk\n      Reasoning: Stable early childhood environment is generally protective against recidivism.\n\n5. Substance use and mental health:\n   a) Used marijuana and cocaine in past four years: High risk\n      Reasoning: Recent drug use is strongly associated with increased recidivism risk.\n   \n   b) No depression reported over the past month: Low risk\n      Reasoning: Absence of recent mental health issues may reduce immediate risk.\n\n6. Religious beliefs: Low risk\n   Reasoning: Belief in a higher power can provide moral guidance and support, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, this analysis seems comprehensive and considers all provided factors. However, it's important to note that the overall prediction should be based on the collective assessment of these factors rather than any single factor. The high-risk factors (criminal history, recent drug use, unstable employment) seem to outweigh the low-risk factors, suggesting a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n</reflection>\n\nNow, let's compile this information into the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age but not extremely young\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White race is not typically associated with increased risk\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are within normal ranges\"),\n    (\"Criminal history\", \"high\", \"Previous arrest and conviction significantly increase risk\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"GED certificate suggests some educational achievement\"),\n    (\"College enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of higher education may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"Employment stability\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, potentially lacking stable family structure\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Currently not living alone provides some support\"),\n    (\"Early childhood environment\", \"low\", \"Stable early childhood reduces risk\"),\n    (\"Recent drug use\", \"high\", \"Strongly associated with increased recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reported\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power may provide moral guidance\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n<reflection>\nAfter finalizing the JSON output, I've reflected on the prediction and confidence level. The high-risk factors (criminal history, recent drug use, unstable employment) outweigh the low-risk factors, leading to a positive recidivism prediction. Given the presence of multiple strong risk indicators, I've set the confidence level at 80%, indicating a relatively high likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age but not extremely young\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White race is not typically associated with increased risk\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are within normal ranges\"),\n    (\"Criminal history\", \"high\", \"Previous arrest and conviction significantly increase risk\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"GED certificate suggests some educational achievement\"),\n    (\"College enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of higher education may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"Employment stability\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, potentially lacking stable family structure\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Currently not living alone provides some support\"),\n    (\"Early childhood environment\", \"low\", \"Stable early childhood reduces risk\"),\n    (\"Recent drug use\", \"high\", \"Strongly associated with increased recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reported\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power may provide moral guidance\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",
