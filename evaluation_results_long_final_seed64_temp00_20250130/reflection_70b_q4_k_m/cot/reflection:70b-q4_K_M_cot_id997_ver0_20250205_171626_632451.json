    "raw_message_text": "<thinking>\nTo solve this problem, I'll need to analyze each piece of information provided about the individual and assess its potential impact on recidivism risk. Then, I'll use these assessments to make a prediction about 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Analyze demographic factors:\n   - Age: 19 (young adult)\n   - Gender: Female\n   - Race: White\n\n2. Examine criminal history:\n   - Arrested once\n   - Convicted once\n\n3. Assess physical characteristics:\n   - Height and weight (6'0\", 155 lbs)\n\n4. Evaluate family and living situation:\n   - Never married\n   - Not living alone\n   - Lived with both biological parents at a young age\n\n5. Consider education and employment:\n   - No high school diploma or GED\n   - Enrolled in 2-year college\n   - Held one job during the year\n\n6. Analyze substance use and mental health:\n   - Used marijuana in past four years\n   - Felt down/depressed some of the time in the past month\n\n7. Evaluate spiritual beliefs:\n   - Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\n8. Assess overall risk factors and make a prediction\n\nLet's go through each factor and assign a relative weight:\n\n1. Demographic factors: Medium (young adult, but female which generally has lower recidivism rates)\n2. Criminal history: High (already arrested and convicted once at a young age)\n3. Physical characteristics: Low (no clear link to recidivism)\n4. Family and living situation: Medium (stable childhood, but current living situation unclear)\n5. Education and employment: Medium (lack of high school diploma, but enrolled in college and has work experience)\n6. Substance use and mental health: High (marijuana use and depression symptoms)\n7. Spiritual beliefs: Low (no clear link to recidivism)\n\n<reflection>\nUpon reflection, the analysis seems comprehensive. However, I should consider that while some factors are individually low or medium risk, their cumulative effect could be significant. Additionally, the fact that she's already been arrested and convicted at a young age is a strong indicator of potential future criminal behavior.\n</reflection>\n\nBased on this analysis, here's the JSON object with the risk factors and prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adult, but still developing\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female, generally lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"No clear link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Criminal history\", \"high\", \"Already arrested and convicted once at a young age\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"No clear link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Stable childhood, but current living situation unclear\"),\n    (\"Education and employment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma, but enrolled in college and has work experience\"),\n    (\"Substance use and mental health\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use and depression symptoms\"),\n    (\"Spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"No clear link to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\n<reflection>\nAfter finalizing the JSON object, I should double-check if it meets all the requirements:\n1. It includes all risk factors mentioned in the problem.\n2. Each factor has a weight (low, medium, high) and a textual reasoning.\n3. The prediction is either YES or NO (in this case, YES).\n4. The confidence level is between 0 and 100 (80 in this case).\n\nThe output appears to be correct and complete, addressing all aspects of the problem.\n</reflection>\n</thinking>\n\n<output>\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young adult, but still developing\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Female, generally lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"No clear link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Criminal history\", \"high\", \"Already arrested and convicted once at a young age\"),\n    (\"Physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"No clear link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Stable childhood, but current living situation unclear\"),\n    (\"Education and employment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma, but enrolled in college and has work experience\"),\n    (\"Substance use and mental health\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use and depression symptoms\"),\n    (\"Spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"No clear link to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n</output>",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.
