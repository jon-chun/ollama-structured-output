Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
