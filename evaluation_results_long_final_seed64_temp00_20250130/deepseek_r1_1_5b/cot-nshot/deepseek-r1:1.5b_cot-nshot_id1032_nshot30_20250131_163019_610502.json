    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples provided.\n\nFirst, the case is a 22-year-old female who identifies as mixed race. She has been arrested once but hasn't convicted it. Her weight is married and living with her spouse. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, isn't enrolled in college, hasn't had any jobs, hasn't used drugs, and feels down when she's depressed. At age 22, she lived in a household of size 4.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, I notice that recidivism outcomes are often influenced by factors like substance abuse, lack of education, family issues, living with a spouse, and mental health. In these cases, if someone has substance abuse problems (like marijuana), they tend to have higher recidivism rates. Similarly, being married or living with a spouse can sometimes lead to lower recidivism because people might feel more secure.\n\nIn the given case, she's married and living with her spouse, which is a positive factor. She hasn't used drugs, so that's good. However, she has been arrested once but hasn't convicted it. This could indicate that she's facing some form of reoffending or being caught again. Her weight (married) might play into this by making her feel more secure.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college, which is another negative factor. But since she's married, maybe the positive aspects outweigh the negatives? Also, she has no jobs, which could mean she's struggling financially but not necessarily directly related to recidivism.\n\nHer depression when feeling down might be a symptom of underlying issues that could lead to reoffending. However, without substance use or education problems, it's harder to predict.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014being married (positive), no education and lack of jobs (negative), and depression (symptom but not directly causing recidivism)\u2014I think the overall risk is moderate. The positive aspects might mitigate some negative ones, leading to a prediction of NO recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"married\", \"medium\", \"living with spouse reduces stress which may help\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma\", \"low\", \"high school is often associated with better opportunities and less reoffending\"),\n    (\"depressed when feeling down\", \"low\", \"depression can be a symptom but not directly causing recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
