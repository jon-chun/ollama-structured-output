    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from other cases. \n\nFirst, I'll list out all the provided information about the case:\n\n- **Person**: 18-year-old female, White identity.\n- **Arrest history**: 1 time, no conviction.\n- **Marital status**: Currently living alone.\n- **Education**: GED certificate and enrolled in a 2-year college.\n- **Job history**: No job during the year; held 1 job previously.\n- **Drug use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. During the last month, she felt down and didn't feel well.\n- **Household**: Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area.\n- **Age at recidivism prediction**: Young age.\n\nNow, I'll analyze each risk factor based on the provided examples to assign weights (low, medium, high) and provide textual reasoning.\n\n1. **Arrest history**: She's been arrested once but not convicted. From example #28, a 21-year-old male with similar details had a recidivism outcome of YES because he was employed and didn't feel down. So, arrest history seems low risk.\n\n2. **Marital status**: Currently living alone. In examples like #30, someone who's single in urban areas with no family issues had a recidivism rate of NO. But since she's married and currently living with her spouse, maybe it's medium risk because being single might be more concerning if they're together.\n\n3. **Education**: GED and enrolled in college. From example #29, someone with similar details had a recidivism rate of NO because he was employed. So education seems low risk.\n\n4. **Job history**: No job during the year; held one before. In example #15, someone without a job but holding a job previously had a recidivism rate of YES. So, no job is high risk.\n\n5. **Drug use**: Used drugs in past four years and felt down. From examples like #27 and #30, drug use with feelings of depression was associated with higher recidivism rates. She's currently feeling down, so this seems high risk.\n\n6. **Household size**: 4 people. In example #15, a household of size 4 had a recidivism rate of NO because they were single and living alone. So, being in a small household might be low risk if others are involved.\n\n7. **Urban area**: Lives in an urban area. From examples like #28, someone from an urban area with no family issues had a recidivism rate of YES. But since she's currently feeling down, maybe it's medium risk.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\n- Arrest history: Low\n- Marital status: Medium\n- Education: Low\n- Job history: High\n- Drug use: High\n- Household size: Low\n- Urban area: Medium\n\nNow, considering the recidivism rate in examples where multiple high-risk factors were present was higher (like example #29 with drug use and feelings of depression). In this case, two high-risk factors (drug use and feeling down) are present. However, she's currently feeling down, which might make her more susceptible.\n\nBut looking at the other risk factors: arrest history is low, education is low, job history is high, household size is low, urban area is medium. The highest risks are drug use (high), feelings of depression (high), and possibly being single (medium). Since she's currently feeling down, that adds to the risk.\n\nGiven all these, I think the recidivism rate should be high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"She has a low probability of recidivism as she was arrested once without conviction.\",\n    \"Based on arrest history being low and no significant negative impact from previous convictions.\",\n    \"No additional factors are present that would significantly increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone may be more concerning than married individuals in urban areas.\",\n    \"Current marital status is medium, which could influence recidivism prediction.\",\n    \"Medium\")\n    ,(\"Education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and enrolled in college suggests a lower risk of recidivism.\",\n    \"Education level is low, which may correlate with lower recidivism rates.\",\n    \"Low\")\n    ,(\"Job history\", \"high\", \"No job during the year but holding one before indicates potential instability.\",\n    \"Job history is high, suggesting higher risk of instability affecting recidivism.\",\n    \"High\")\n    ,(\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Using drugs in past four years and feeling down in the last month suggests depression.\",\n    \"Drug use is high, which is a significant factor contributing to higher recidivism risks.\",\n    \"High\")\n    ,(\"Household size\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents in an urban area indicates a smaller household.\",\n    \"Household size is low, suggesting lower risk of family issues affecting recidivism.\",\n    \"Low\")\n    ,(\"Urban area\", \"medium\", \"Lives in an urban area but currently feels down, which may increase recidivism risks.\",\n    \"Urban area is medium, and current feelings of depression could be a significant factor.\",\n    \"Medium\")\n  ],\n  \"recidivism_rate\": \"high\"\n}",
