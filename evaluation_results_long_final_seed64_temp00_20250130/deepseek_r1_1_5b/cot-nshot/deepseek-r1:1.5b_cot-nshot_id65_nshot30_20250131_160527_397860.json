    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to predict the recidivism rate for a specific 19-year-old male based on his risk factors using the provided examples.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors present in the case and assign weights to each. From the examples, it seems that each factor has a medium weight because they are somewhat indicative of recidivism. For instance, being married (factor 3) is associated with higher recidivism rates, but since he's single here, it's low.\n\nNext, I'll evaluate each risk factor individually:\n\n1. **Arrest history**: He was arrested once and not convicted. This might indicate some recidivism potential.\n2. **Marital status**: Single, which could mean less support from family or friends, possibly lower recidivism.\n3. **Education**: No high school diploma or GED, which is a significant factor as education level affects reoffending rates.\n4. **Job history**: No jobs during the year, so no immediate issues with employment.\n5. **Drug use**: Cocaine, which is known to contribute to recidivism.\n6. **Depression**: Not feeling depressed over the past month, suggesting a positive mental state.\n7. **Family background**: Lived with biological mother in an urban area, which might have influenced his behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, especially the lack of education and drug use, it's likely that this individual is at higher risk for recidivism. Therefore, the prediction should be \"YES.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"The individual is single, which may indicate less support from family or friends.\",\n     \"This could lead to lower recidivism rates compared to those who are married and have a stable family background.\"), \n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate, which significantly impacts reoffending patterns.\",\n     \"A lack of education can contribute to higher recidivism rates as individuals may not seek help from authorities.\"),\n    (\"Job history\", \"low\", \"No jobs during the year suggests no immediate issues with employment.\",\n     \"This could indicate a more stable environment and potentially lower recidivism rates.\"), \n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Cocaine use is known to contribute to recidivism.\",\n     \"Individuals who engage in drug use may face increased risks of reoffending.\"), \n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests a positive mental state.\",\n     \"A lack of depression can mitigate some negative effects on recidivism rates.\"), \n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area, which may have influenced his behavior.\",\n     \"This family environment could have contributed to higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
