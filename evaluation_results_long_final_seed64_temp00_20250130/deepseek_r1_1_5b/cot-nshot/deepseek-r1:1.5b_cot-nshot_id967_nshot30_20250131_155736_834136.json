    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The task is to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors and examples from similar cases.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each part of the input means. The case provided has several risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 19 years old.\n2. Gender: White.\n3. Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n4. Employment history: No jobs during the year; held two jobs.\n5. Substance use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.\n6. Depression: Not felt depressed over the past month.\n7. Home environment: Lived with both biological parents in a rural area.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, each has a set of risk factors and an outcome (YES or NO) based on a weighted analysis. The goal is to apply similar reasoning to this case.\n\nI'll start by evaluating each risk factor individually:\n\n1. **Age**: 19 years old. In general, younger individuals might have different recidivism rates compared to older ones. However, without specific data, it's hard to assign a weight. Maybe medium since they're in their early twenties.\n   \n2. **Gender**: White. This could influence recidivism based on societal factors. Since the examples don't provide specifics, I'll assume it's medium.\n\n3. **Education**: High school diploma but not enrolled in college. This is a common risk factor; people without higher education might be more likely to reoffend. So, high weight.\n\n4. **Employment history**: No jobs during the year and held two jobs. This suggests some level of job stability or uncertainty. Maybe medium because it's about work experience but not extreme.\n\n5. **Substance use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. This is a serious issue, especially for non-citizens. High weight here.\n\n6. **Depression**: Not feeling depressed over the past month. This could be a positive factor as it might indicate better mental health, which can influence recidivism. Maybe medium since it's not extreme but present.\n\n7. **Home environment**: Lived with both parents in a rural area. This is a stable environment, which is generally good for recidivism prediction because it reduces stress and uncertainty. High weight here.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights based on the above reasoning:\n\n- Age: Medium\n- Gender: Medium\n- Education: High\n- Employment history: Medium\n- Substance use: High\n- Depression: Medium\n- Home environment: High\n\nNext, I need to assess how each factor contributes to rearrest recidivism. Higher weight factors are more likely to lead to recidivism.\n\nLooking at the examples, factors like substance use and high education were associated with higher outcomes (YES). So, combining these would increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: The case has a mix of moderate risk factors but includes some that significantly contribute. Given the weightings, rearrest is likely to occur.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Stable age may influence behavior but not extreme\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"medium\", \"White background could have varying effects on recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"No college degree might increase reoffspring chances\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Job history with two jobs suggests some work experience but not extremes\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana and cocaine are serious substances that can significantly impact recidivism\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues may mitigate or exacerbate recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"Home environment\", \"high\", \"Stable living with parents in rural area reduces uncertainty and stress\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
