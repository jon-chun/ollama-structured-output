    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed case study about a 22-year-old Black male who is facing rearrest recidivism. They've given examples of similar cases with their risk factors and outcomes, which I can use to analyze the current case.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors present in the case. The key points are:\n\n1. **Arrest history**: He's been arrested 5 times but hasn't been convicted.\n2. **Marital status**: Currently living alone.\n3. **Education**: No high school diploma or GED certificate.\n4. **Employment**: Has held 3 jobs during the year.\n5. **Drug use**: Not using any drugs in the past four years, except for marijuana in some months.\n6. **Age and household**: 22 years old, lived with biological mother in a 5-person household in an urban area.\n\nNow, I'll assign weights to each risk factor based on the provided examples. The user mentioned that lower recidivism rates are associated with higher risk factors. So, if a factor is more severe or has a stronger impact, it should be weighted accordingly.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n- **Arrest history**: In example #29, someone was arrested 1 time but not convicted and had a high weight for this factor because recidivism was low.\n- **Marital status**: Example #30 shows that living alone can lead to higher recidivism, so this should be weighted high.\n- **Education**: The absence of education is a significant risk factor. In example #27, someone without a high school diploma had lower recidivism, indicating this factor is crucial.\n- **Employment**: Example #31 isn't provided, but generally, employment history can influence recidivism; maybe moderate weight here.\n- **Drug use**: The user didn't mention drug use in the examples, so I'll assume it's low or medium. In example #29, marijuana was used, which might be a risk factor, but since it wasn't mentioned as a factor, perhaps it's low.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n\n- **Arrest history**: 5 times without conviction. This is severe and likely to increase recidivism.\n- **Marital status**: Living alone increases recidivism.\n- **Education**: No diploma or GED, which is a strong risk factor.\n- **Employment**: 3 jobs might indicate some stability but could also mean more opportunities, possibly lower recidivism. However, in example #27, someone without education had low recidivism, so maybe moderate weight here.\n- **Drug use**: Not mentioned, but if used occasionally, it's a risk factor. In example #29, marijuana was used, which might be a high risk.\n\nPutting this together, the arrest history and drug use are the most concerning factors. They should have higher weights. The other factors like marital status and education are less severe but still significant.\n\nBased on these considerations, I'll assign medium weights to arrest history and drug use, low to marital status and education. However, since arrest history is so severe (5 times without conviction), it's likely a high weight factor. Marital status being alone increases recidivism, so also high. Education being without diploma is crucial, so high as well.\n\nThe other factors like employment might be moderate because they don't seem to directly correlate with higher recidivism rates in the examples provided. So, I'll assign medium weights to them.\n\nNow, for the prediction: The arrest history and drug use are major risks. In example #29, someone without a high school diploma had low recidivism, so this factor is significant. Therefore, the overall risk should be high, leading to a \"YES\" outcome.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"high\", \" severe arrest history leads to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"high\", \" living alone increases recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \" no high school diploma or GED certificate is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \" 3 jobs may indicate some stability but could also mean more opportunities, possibly lower recidivism. However, in example #27, someone without education had low recidivism, so moderate weight here\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"low\", \" not mentioned, but if used occasionally, it's a risk factor. In example #29, marijuana was used, which might be a high risk factor\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
