    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed case study of an 18-year-old male who is facing rearrest recidivism, and they want to predict the likelihood of him re-arresting in three years using a weighted risk factor analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the relevant risk factors from the given examples. Looking at the examples, the key risk factors seem to include substance use history, family background, living situation, education level, mental health status, and economic stability. Each of these factors has been addressed in previous cases with varying degrees of recidivism outcomes.\n\nNow, applying this to the specific case:\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: The individual has been arrested 3 times and convicted. This is a significant risk factor because multiple convictions can lead to higher recidivism rates.\n2. **Family Background**: No information on family history is provided, so this might be considered low or medium based on other factors like parental substance use or support systems.\n3. **Living Situation**: Currently living alone in a rural area with a household size of 6. This could affect access to resources and mental health support.\n4. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED, which is a clear low risk factor as education plays a role in recidivism.\n5. **Mental Health**: The individual has been experiencing severe depression for the past month, which is a strong indicator of mental health issues that could lead to re-arrest.\n6. **Economic Status**: No information on income or employment status, so this might be considered low.\n\nNext, I assign weights to each factor based on their impact:\n\n- **Arrest Record (3 times)**: High weight because multiple convictions are a significant risk.\n- **Family Background**: Medium weight if family history isn't provided but may vary depending on other factors.\n- **Living Situation**: Low weight due to living alone and rural background, which can affect mental health and access to resources.\n- **Education Level**: Low weight as no high school diploma is mentioned.\n- **Mental Health**: High weight because severe depression is a serious issue that could lead to re-arrest.\n- **Economic Status**: Medium weight if income isn't provided but might be considered low without more info.\n\nConsidering the mental health and economic status, these factors are strong indicators of potential recidivism. The arrest record being high adds another layer of risk. However, since the individual is living alone in a rural area with no family support, some of these risks might be mitigated to a certain extent.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple convictions, severe mental health issues, and living conditions suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism. Therefore, the prediction should lean towards \"YES\" for rearrest recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate a significant risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"No information on family history but may vary based on other factors\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone in a rural area with a household size of 6, which can affect access to resources and mental health support.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate, which is a clear low risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Severe depression for the past month indicates a serious issue that could lead to re-arrest.\"),\n    (\"Economic Status\", \"medium\", \"No information on income or employment status but may be considered low without more info.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
