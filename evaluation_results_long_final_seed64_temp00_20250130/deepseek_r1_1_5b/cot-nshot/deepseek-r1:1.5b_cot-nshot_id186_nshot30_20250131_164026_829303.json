    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old Asian Pacific Islander male. Let me start by breaking down each risk factor provided in the examples.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old, which is younger than some of the older cases but not too young either. He identifies as Asian Pacific Islander, which might influence his behavior compared to other races. He was arrested once and convicted, so that's a clear positive factor. He's 5'9\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs, which is within the healthy weight range for his height.\n\nHe hasn't been married yet, so he's single or in a relationship with someone else. Being not living alone means he might have more social interactions, but since he's Asian, maybe that affects how he interacts with others. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which could mean he's less educated compared to those who are. He's had one job during the past year, so some work experience is present.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, but since it's been only once, maybe that's not a major factor here. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate better mental health compared to those who have. He lived with both biological parents in a 5-person household in an urban area, so social interactions are limited by his family.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, cases where recidivism was predicted were when factors like high school diploma (high), no substance use (medium?), and living alone (low) all contributed positively. But wait, he's not living alone, which might be a negative factor because it could mean less social interaction compared to someone who is single.\n\nHe has a conviction record, which is a strong positive factor. His weight is within the healthy range, so that's neutral. He's Asian, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism without more specific examples. The lack of substance use (marijuana) might be considered low, and living alone could be low as well.\n\nWait, in the examples where recidivism was predicted, factors like high school diploma (high), no substance use (medium?), living alone (low), and being Asian (maybe medium?) contributed to a positive outcome. But since he's not living alone, that might pull it down. Also, his conviction is a big factor.\n\nSo putting it all together: high for high school diploma, low for living alone, medium for no substance use, neutral for weight, and maybe low for Asian (since he's Asian Pacific Islander). The conviction record is definitely high because he was convicted once. So overall, the factors are leaning towards a higher risk of recidivism.\n\nWait, but in some examples, even with a high school diploma, if someone has substance use or living alone, it can affect recidivism. Since he's Asian and not living alone, maybe that's a positive factor? Or is it more about his background?\n\nI'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The factors are: high school diploma (high), no substance use (medium?), living alone (low), weight (neutral), conviction record (high). So the recidivism outcome would be medium because he has a high school diploma, but also is Asian and not living alone, which might mitigate some of that.\n\nWait, in the examples where recidivism was predicted, factors like high school diploma (high) and no substance use (medium?) contributed positively. But since he's Asian, maybe that's a positive factor too. So overall, it's medium risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high school diploma\", \"high\", \"Strong educational background contributes to recidivism\"),\n    (\"no substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate factor as it's not severe\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Reduced social interactions can increase recidivism\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"neutral\", \"Within healthy range, no significant impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"conviction record\", \"high\", \"Single conviction indicates a higher risk of reoffending\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"Medium\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
