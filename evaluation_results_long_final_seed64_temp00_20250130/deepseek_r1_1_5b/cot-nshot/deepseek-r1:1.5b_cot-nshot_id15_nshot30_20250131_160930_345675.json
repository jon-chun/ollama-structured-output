    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. The user has provided a detailed case study of a 19-year-old Black male who is currently living alone, married, with a high school diploma, holding two jobs, using drugs, not feeling depressed, and having lived with his biological mother in an urban household for five years. They want to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome based on given examples and risk factors.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each risk factor provided in the examples and assign a weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them. Then, combine these weights to assess the overall risk of recidivism for this case.\n\nLooking at the examples, most have low weights except one with a high weight. For instance, Example 28 has a high weight for \"high school diploma\" and others are lower. So, I'll apply similar logic here.\n\nNext, I need to evaluate each factor in the given case against these risk factors:\n\n1. **Arrest history**: The individual has been arrested twice but not convicted. This is a moderate risk because it's more than zero but less than once.\n2. **Marital status**: Currently living with his spouse\u2014this is a low risk since being married is generally considered a stable relationship.\n3. **Education level**: High school diploma, which is typically associated with lower recidivism rates compared to some other education levels.\n4. **Employment history**: Holding two jobs suggests a higher likelihood of finding employment in the future, which could reduce recidivism.\n5. **Drug use history**: No past drug use, which might indicate less risk from substance abuse.\n6. **Depression**: Not feeling depressed over the past month\u2014this is a positive sign and likely reduces recidivism.\n7. **Living with biological mother in urban area for five years**: This could mean more exposure to stress or family issues, but it's not extremely severe.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the individual has low risk of being rearrested due to stable marital status, lower education level, employment history, and a positive outlook from not feeling depressed. The high arrest history is offset by the lack of convictions and the marriage status.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Marital status\", \"low\", \"Stable marital status reduces recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma typically correlates with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"high\", \"Holding two jobs suggests a higher likelihood of finding employment in the future, reducing recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug use history\", \"low\", \"No past drug use indicates less risk from substance abuse\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests a positive outlook on mental health and reduced recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"Living with biological mother in urban area for five years\", \"medium\", \"Exposure to stress or family issues may slightly increase risk, but not excessively so\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
