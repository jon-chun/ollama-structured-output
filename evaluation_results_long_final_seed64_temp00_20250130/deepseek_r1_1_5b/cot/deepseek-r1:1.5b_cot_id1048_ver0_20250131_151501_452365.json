He's a young adult living alone, hasn't had any jobs, and has used drugs in the past four years. He's lived with his mom before, which might have affected him.\n\nFirst, I need to identify all the risk factors that could lead to rearrest. Let me list them out:\n\n1. **Age**: 18 is relatively young, but he's already been arrested six times. Young people often face higher recidivism rates because they're more vulnerable to reoffending.\n2. **Gender (Hispanic)**: Hispanic males are generally more likely to reoffend compared to non-Hispanics. This could be a significant factor.\n3. **Marital Status**: He's single, which might mean less support from family and friends for him to reintegrate into society.\n4. **Job History**: No jobs in the past year, so he hasn't had any income to rely on for reentry.\n5. **Drug Use**: He's used drugs in the past four years, especially during a time of low motivation. This could affect his ability to reintegrate.\n6. **Family Dynamics**: Lived with his mom before, which might have influenced his behavior and mental health.\n\nNow, I need to assign weights to each factor. Young people (18) are high risk because they're more likely to reoffend. Hispanic males are also high risk due to cultural factors. Single individuals are at a higher risk because they can't rely on family support for reintegrating. No job history means he's in a tough spot, so that's another high risk factor. Drug use is significant because it affects his ability to reintegrate and could lead to recidivism. Family dynamics from living with his mom might have influenced his behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, rearrest seems highly likely. The young age, Hispanic background, single status, lack of job history, drug use, and family dynamics all contribute to a high risk. I think the confidence should be very high because each factor points towards a higher chance of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young age\", \"high\", \"reaching maturity often increases recidivism\"),\n    (\"hispanic gender\", \"high\", \"cultural factors and societal expectations can influence reoffending rates\"),\n    (\"single status\", \"high\", \"lack of family support for reintegrating into society\"),\n    (\"no job history\", \"high\", \"unable to rely on income for reentry\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"significantly affects ability to reintegrate and may lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family dynamics from living with his mom\", \"high\", \"family support can influence behavior and mental health\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}",

He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
