    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this young Hispanic male who's been arrested four times. He's a 20-year-old living alone with his parents in an urban area, has a high school diploma, never college, used marijuana, hasn't felt depressed over the past month, and considers God involved.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old, which is young, so that might mean he's more likely to engage in criminal behavior. But since he's Hispanic, maybe there are some cultural factors at play too. He's been arrested four times, which is quite high for his age, especially if he's not college educated.\n\nHe's a 5'11\" man and weighs between 200-224 lbs. That doesn't seem like a huge weight, but maybe it affects how he interacts with others or his physical health. He's never married and living alone, which might mean he's more vulnerable to domestic abuse or other issues.\n\nHe has two jobs during the year, so that could lead to some financial instability if he can't manage both. He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That seems contradictory\u2014using drugs without feeling depressed? Maybe he's dealing with anxiety or something else related to his drug use.\n\nHe considers God involved, which is interesting because it suggests a spiritual component. But I'm not sure how that ties into recidivism risk factors. It might be more about personal beliefs rather than actual behavior.\n\nHis family is in an urban area, so maybe he's exposed to the same environments where crime happens. That could increase his risk of reoffending. He's never married and living alone, which might mean he's at higher risk for domestic violence or other issues that lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but hasn't gone to college, which might limit his opportunities in the job market. His lack of education could also contribute to recidivism because he might not have the skills needed to handle situations on his own.\n\nHe's used marijuana and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems like a concerning combination. Maybe he's dealing with both drug use and stress, which could be contributing factors for criminal behavior in the future.\n\nHis living situation alone is another risk factor. He might not have access to support systems or resources that others would rely on if they were in a better position financially or socially.\n\nPutting this all together, his age, arrest history, family background, lack of education, and personal beliefs about God could all increase his recidivism risk. The high number of arrests suggests he's at higher risk for reoffending, especially since he's Hispanic and living alone with his parents in an urban area where crime is common.\n\nI think the confidence level should be high because there are multiple factors contributing to his risk. But I'm not entirely sure if all these elements are equally impactful or if some might mitigate others.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"young age increases criminal behavior and recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"four arrests indicate significant criminal activity and risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"living alone in an urban area exposes him to crime and stress\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma but no college suggests limited opportunities for self-reliance\"),\n    (\"personal beliefs about God\", \"low\", \"interpretation of personal faith may not directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drugs and mental health\", \"medium\", \"marijuana and lack of depression suggest stress and anxiety contributing to criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
