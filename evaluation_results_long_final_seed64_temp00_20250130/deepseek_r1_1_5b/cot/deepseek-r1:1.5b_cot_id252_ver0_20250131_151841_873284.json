Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male from an Asian Pacific Islander background. He's been arrested three times and convicted, which already shows some serious issues. He's married and living alone, which might affect his social life and support system. His education is limited to high school or GED, so that could be a barrier for higher education later on.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which means he might struggle with college enrollment. That's a concern because if he can't attend college, it could delay his recidivism risk prediction and make him more likely to stay in jail or reenter the workforce.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year but hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. Some months ago, he felt down and didn't feel motivated, which might have affected his motivation for further actions. However, this could also be a temporary stressor that might not persist into the future.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 11. That's quite small, so there might be more family members around him who could provide support or influence his behavior. He considers God to have something to do with his personal life, which is interesting but might not directly impact his recidivism risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This means he might face barriers when trying to attend college later on, which could delay his recidivism prediction and make him more likely to stay in jail or reenter the workforce.\n\nHis family size is small, so there's more support available around him. However, this doesn't necessarily mean he won't have issues with recidivism. The other factors like past convictions, lack of education, and stress from feeling down could all contribute to a higher risk of rearrest.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact weight each factor has on recidivism risk. But considering his background, family size, lack of education, and stress, I think he's at a higher risk. So, predicting a YES seems reasonable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"low\", \"The person has been arrested three times and convicted, indicating serious past issues that could affect recidivism prediction.\",\n     \"Some months ago, the person felt down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
