    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old who identifies as White. That might be a positive sign because it's common in many communities. He's been arrested 10 times and has been convicted, which is a lot. But I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. Maybe it's just part of his history.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 160 lbs. That seems about right for an adult male. His height isn't too tall, so maybe he's in a more vulnerable area. But I'm not sure how that affects recidivism.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That might mean he has less support from family or friends, which could be a risk factor. But again, I'm not certain if living alone without support is bad for recidivism.\n\nHis education level isn't high\u2014no diploma or GED, and he's not enrolled in college. That might make him more vulnerable because of lower educational attainment. But maybe it's also due to other factors like substance abuse.\n\nHe has held 1 job during the year but hasn't mentioned his current job status. If he's employed, that could be a positive sign. But if he's not working, that might indicate instability or lack of support from his employer.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's concerning because substance abuse can lead to recidivism. I'm not sure how much impact that has had on his behavior over time.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems more like a positive trait, but it might indicate that he's been through some stress or challenges without feeling overwhelmed. But I'm not sure if that directly affects recidivism risk factors.\n\nThe household size is 3, and he considers God to have something to do with his personal life. This could be a positive sign because it suggests he has some level of control over his situation. However, I don't know how much influence God would have on recidivism risk factors.\n\nHe's young and lived in a household of size 3 when he was arrested. That might mean he had less support from family or friends at the time of arrest, which could be a risk factor. But again, I'm not certain if that's a significant concern.\n\nPutting it all together, his history of arrests is concerning, but maybe not as bad as someone with a longer criminal history. His education level and substance abuse history are both red flags. Living alone without support might also add to the risk. However, he has some positive traits like being White and living in a small household.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because of his substance use, lack of support at the time, and possibly living alone. But I'm not entirely sure if that's enough to categorize it as high or medium. Maybe I should consider other factors too, but based on what I have, recidivism seems likely.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"substance abuse has been a significant factor in his behavior and may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"lived_alone\", \"medium\", \"living alone without support at the time of arrest could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"low\", \"the household size is 3, suggesting limited family support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"lower educational attainment may contribute to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
