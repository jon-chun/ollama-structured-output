    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old Black male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a high risk because arrest without conviction is usually associated with higher recidivism rates. He's 5'9\" and weighs 185 lbs, which are pretty average stats for his age.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which might make him feel isolated. But he has a high school diploma and isn't in college, so maybe that's not too bad. His family is small with five members, living together with his biological mother. That could mean he's dealing with some stress or uncertainty about his future.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't been convicted of using it. I know that marijuana use can be a risk factor for recidivism because it might affect someone's mental health and behavior. He's also not feeling depressed over the past month, which is positive.\n\nAt 20, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. That could mean he has some support system but maybe isn't alone. However, he's still young, so there might be more uncertainty about his future.\n\nPutting this all together, I think he's at a high risk because he's been arrested without conviction, which is a strong indicator of recidivism. His lack of substance abuse history and positive mood are also factors. But since he's 20, there's still some uncertainty, so maybe the risk isn't extremely high but it's definitely concerning.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact weights for each factor, but I think arrest without conviction is a big one. Maybe marijuana use is a bit of a concern too. So overall, his recidivism risk might be on the higher side, but it's still manageable with some support.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_without_conviction\", \"high\", \"arrest without conviction is a strong indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"low\", \"no substance abuse history\", \"positive mood over past month\"),\n    (\"medium\", \"young age and family uncertainty\", \"small household with biological mother\"),\n    (\"medium\", \"lack of support system\", \"some stress but not alone\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
