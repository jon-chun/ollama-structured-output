    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested once and convicted, which is pretty serious. She's 6 feet tall and weighs 155 lbs, so that's not super short or too heavy for her age. She hasn't married yet and isn't living alone, which might mean she has some support system around her. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and is in college, which could be an issue if she drops out later.\n\nShe's 19, so that's pretty young. She's never been married but hasn't mentioned it yet, so maybe she's not as dependent on someone else. Her current living situation is in a household of size 7, which isn't too bad. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and is enrolled in a two-year college. That could be a problem if she drops out.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, mostly marijuana, but specifically during the past month, she felt down and didn't feel up at all. That's concerning because drug use can lead to recidivism. She also mentioned feeling so down that nothing could cheer her up, which might indicate a lack of motivation or support system.\n\nShe's from an urban area, which is good for some resources but not necessarily bad if she has other issues. She considers God to have something to do with her personal life, which is interesting. But I'm not sure how significant that is in predicting recidivism.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors:\n\n1. Age: 19 is young, and she's from an urban area. Maybe that's a low risk if other factors are good.\n2. Marital status: She hasn't mentioned being married yet, so maybe no immediate dependency on someone else.\n3. Living situation: In a household of size 7, which isn't too bad. Not living alone might help with support systems.\n4. Education: She's not high school or GED and is in college. That could be an issue if she drops out later.\n5. Drug use history: She used marijuana but hasn't been heavily involved. Maybe that's a low risk factor.\n6. Feelings of downness: Feeling so down might indicate lack of motivation, which could be a high risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, her age and education are both moderate risks. Her living situation is good, but she's from an urban area, which might have some support issues. The drug use history isn't too bad, but the feelings of downness could be significant. I'm leaning towards a medium risk overall because while there are some issues, they're not severe enough to make her very likely to rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19-year-old female from an urban area\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"not married yet and living with family in a household of size 7\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"medium\", \"not living alone but not in the highest risk groups\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"not high school or GED, enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"low\", \"used marijuana but hasn't been heavily involved\"),\n    (\"downness\u611f\", \"high\", \"feeling of low motivation and downness\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
