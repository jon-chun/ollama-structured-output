    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That might be a bit of a stereotype, but maybe it affects his behavior. He has been arrested once and convicted, so that's a clear risk factor. Being a minor could also pose a problem because they're more vulnerable to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHe's 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs between 225 and 249 pounds. That seems about right for his age. His weight is within the healthy range, so that doesn't seem like a big issue. He's never been married and isn't living alone, which might mean he has more time to engage in risky behaviors or face stress from being single.\n\nHe hasn't been married yet, so maybe he can handle the stress of not having someone around him as much. His weight is also within his ideal range, so that doesn't seem concerning. He's a high school graduate and isn't enrolled in college, which might give him some time to develop substance use or other issues.\n\nHe has a GED certificate but hasn't taken any classes this year. That could mean he's not actively engaging in education, which might lead to substance abuse or other behaviors. He's not currently enrolled in college, so maybe he can take some steps towards improving his skills before the rearrest.\n\nHe's lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4 for five years. That's a relatively small family, but it could mean more time spent on substance abuse or other issues. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Those are both serious concerns because drug use can lead to addiction and mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his parents in an urban area. Urban living might be associated with higher rates of substance abuse or other risky behaviors, but I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors like substance use.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life. That's interesting because it suggests a spiritual component to his behavior, which could be a risk factor if he's struggling with addiction or mental health issues.\n\nPutting this all together, the main risk factors seem to include substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine), feeling depressed, and living in an urban area where there might be higher rates of risky behaviors. These are significant concerns because they can lead to addiction, mental health issues, and ultimately rearrest.\n\nI think these factors have a high weight because they directly impact his ability to reintegrate into society or make changes needed for his future. The person's age, living situation, and substance use history suggest he might be at higher risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"he hasn't felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"urban_living\", \"medium\", \"he considers god to have something to do with his personal life\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
