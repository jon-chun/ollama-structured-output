    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this young man. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested five times and has convictions, which is pretty concerning. Being a minor with no high school diploma makes him at risk because he can't handle the consequences of his actions on his own. That seems like a strong factor pointing towards rearrest.\n\nNext, his age being under 21 adds to the risk. He's living alone, and while that might seem manageable, it doesn't change the fact that he's a minor who hasn't had much supervision or support in the past. Plus, he's never used drugs before, which could lead to problems later on.\n\nHis family background is also important. He lived with his biological mother in a small household of three in an urban area. That might have some social and legal implications, but it doesn't excuse him from facing potential re-arrest. His living situation alone isn't enough to prevent him from being rearrested.\n\nHe's never married or had children, which is another significant factor. Being single without a stable family can make someone more vulnerable to criminal behavior because they have fewer support networks and less time to learn from mistakes.\n\nHis lack of education up until now doesn't excuse him from facing the consequences of his actions. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years or felt depressed over the last month, which are positive signs that he's capable of handling his situation.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor points towards rearrest. The high risk factors include his age, lack of education, living alone, and family background. These make him a prime candidate for rearrest because they present significant challenges without any mitigating circumstances.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"He is a minor with no high school diploma and has never had much supervision or support in the past\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"high\", \"Lived with his biological mother in a small household of three in an urban area\"),\n    (\"single status\", \"high\", \"Never married and has not had children, making him more vulnerable to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"high\", \"Has never used drugs or felt depressed over the past month\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
