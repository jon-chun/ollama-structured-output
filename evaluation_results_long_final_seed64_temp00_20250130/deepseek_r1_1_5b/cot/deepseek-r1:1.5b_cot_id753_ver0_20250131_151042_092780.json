Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. He has been arrested twice and is convicted, which already shows some serious issues. His height and weight are normal, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything about his risk factors. He's never married or living alone, which might indicate some instability in relationships, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That could be a red flag because many people with lower education levels are more likely to engage in criminal behavior. However, it's also possible that he might have some skills or knowledge that could help him out, but I'm not sure.\n\nHe has held one job during the year and used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. That's concerning because drug use can lead to serious health issues and sometimes criminal behavior. He's also mentioned feeling down in the dumps at times, which might indicate low self-esteem or motivation. This could make him more prone to engaging in criminal activities.\n\nHis family is small with four members: he lived with both biological parents as a child. That might have some social support, but it's not extensive. His religious beliefs aren't mentioned, so I can't assume anything about his behavior based on that.\n\nPutting this all together, the main risks seem to be drug use and low self-esteem leading to criminal behavior. The lack of education or higher qualifications doesn't necessarily make him a danger, but he does have some negative traits that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nI think the prediction should be YES because these factors are significant enough to increase his risk of rearrest. The confidence level would be medium because while there's some concern about drug use and low self-esteem, other factors like education might play a role in reducing recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"drugs\", \"low\", \"He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and at times felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.\"), \n    (\"low self-esteem\", \"At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4.
