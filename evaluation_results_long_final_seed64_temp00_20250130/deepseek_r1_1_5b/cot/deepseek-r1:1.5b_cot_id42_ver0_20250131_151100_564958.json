    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this young Asian male who's lived with his biological father in a small urban household is likely to rearrest after three years. Let me break down the factors one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old Asian male, which might give him some psychological advantages because of his background. He's never been married and living alone, so that could mean less stress from social interactions or family issues. His high school diploma but not in college suggests he has some work experience, which is a plus for recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which might indicate he doesn't have substance abuse as a significant factor. However, he's still using marijuana, which could be concerning because drug use often correlates with higher recidivism rates. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, so his mental health isn't a big issue here.\n\nHis upbringing in a small household of two might mean less support for social issues and possibly more isolation. But since he's Asian, there might be some cultural influences that could affect his behavior or decision-making. His family ties to God aren't directly relevant unless it affects his sense of identity or purpose, which isn't mentioned.\n\nLooking at the factors: no substance abuse, low drug use, not feeling depressed, living alone in a small household, and being Asian might all contribute to lower recidivism rates compared to the general population. However, he's still an 18-year-old, so there could be some age-related changes that make him more prone to reoffending.\n\nI'm leaning towards yes because his background factors seem to mitigate some risks, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider other factors like family dynamics or cultural influences. Since he's Asian and living alone, maybe that has some positive aspects. But without specific information on substance use or family support, it's a bit hard to say for certain.\n\nI think the confidence level is medium because while there are some mitigating factors, there could still be some recidivism given his age and possibly other underlying issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"low\", \"No significant substance abuse in past four years.
