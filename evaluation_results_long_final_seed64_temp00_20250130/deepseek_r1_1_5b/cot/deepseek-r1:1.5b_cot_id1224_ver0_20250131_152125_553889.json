    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person has a high risk of rearrest in the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times. That seems like a lot for his age and race. He's never been married and living alone, which might make him feel isolated or vulnerable. But I'm not sure how that affects recidivism rates yet.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 155 lbs. That doesn't seem too heavy, but maybe it reflects his physical condition or past behavior. He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, so that's a plus. But he did use some drugs during the past month, which might have caused him some stress or anxiety.\n\nHe's from a rural household of seven and considers God to be involved with his life. That could mean he has a strong sense of purpose or faith, but I'm not sure how that translates into recidivism risk. Maybe it helps him stay motivated, but I don't know if that's enough to increase his chances.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now, which might indicate he's trying harder to get out of prison. But without any prior convictions, especially for serious crimes, that could be a challenge. His lack of jobs and drug use during the past month might have made him feel like he was going through tough times, but I'm not sure how that affects his recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together, he's from a vulnerable background, has some isolated experiences, and hasn't shown signs of substance abuse or criminal behavior. But with four prior arrests, especially for serious crimes, that might be a significant risk factor. His lack of education and job history could also make him more susceptible to recidivism.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because he's from a vulnerable area, has some isolated experiences, and hasn't shown signs of substance abuse or criminal behavior. But I'm not entirely sure if that's enough to make the prediction 100%. Maybe there are other factors at play here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"isolated_or_vulnerable\", \"medium\", \"He has a vulnerable background and has lived in a rural household, which might indicate some isolation or vulnerability.\",\n    (\"isolated_or_vulnerable\", \"medium\", \"His lack of education and job history could make him more susceptible to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in a rural area.
