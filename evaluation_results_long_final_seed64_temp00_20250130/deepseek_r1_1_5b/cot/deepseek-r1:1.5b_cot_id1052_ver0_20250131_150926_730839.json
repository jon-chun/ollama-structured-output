    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person has a high risk of rearrest in the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old Hispanic male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a significant risk because being arrested means he's facing some form of criminal liability. His age is young, which might mean there's more time to learn and adjust, but it also could be a factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 199 lbs. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own, but combined with his other factors, maybe it adds up. He's single, hasn't married yet, which might mean he's more vulnerable to being alone in the house or dealing with other issues.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. That could be a big risk because being single increases the likelihood of being isolated, which can lead to criminal behavior. Plus, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might mean he's not as educated or prepared for law school.\n\nHe's 3 jobs during the year but hasn't mentioned them yet. That could indicate that he's balancing work and family life, which is important because being in two jobs can lead to stress and potential criminal behavior if he neglects responsibilities.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Using drugs like marijuana can be a serious issue, especially if it affects mental health. His lack of depression might not directly contribute, but it could indicate that he's dealing with some stress or emotional challenges.\n\nAt his young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size five. That means there are other family members around him, which can lead to more vulnerable situations and increased risk of criminal behavior because he's surrounded by others who might be stressed or have their own issues.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life. While this is interesting, it doesn't directly address any specific risk factors related to criminal behavior. It could mean he's seeking guidance from a spiritual perspective but doesn't provide concrete evidence of criminal tendencies.\n\nPutting all these together: being arrested once, living alone, having no high school diploma, using marijuana, and not feeling depressed are all significant risks. The fact that he's single adds another layer of vulnerability because being alone can lead to criminal behavior if neglected. His age is young, which might give him more time to adjust but also increases the risk due to potential neglect.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, it seems like this person has a high risk of rearrest in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"being arrested once\", \"high\", \"arrested indicates criminal liability\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"high\", \"single status increases vulnerability to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma\", \"high\", \"lack of education affects legal education and career planning\"),\n    (\"using marijuana in the past four years\", \"high\", \"marijuana can lead to substance abuse issues affecting mental health and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"not feeling depressed over the last month\", \"low\", \"depression is a separate issue from criminal behavior but may contribute indirectly through stress\"),\n    (\"young age and single status\", \"high\", \"single status increases vulnerability to criminal behavior, especially neglect issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
