He's a 20-year-old living alone with no previous convictions, has a high school diploma, and is in college. He's never married and uses drugs, especially marijuana, which he feels is affecting his mood. He comes from a household of four parents in an urban area.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the risk factors. The main ones seem to be substance use, living alone, and possibly criminal behavior. Since he's been arrested once, that's a significant factor. His age being young might also play a role because younger people are more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's from an urban household with four parents, which is common for many, so that doesn't seem too high or low. He's never married and living alone could mean he's dealing with feelings of isolation, which might contribute to recidivism. His drug use, especially marijuana, has been a recent issue, which is concerning because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nI should consider each factor's likelihood. Age being young increases the risk of reoffending. Living alone in an urban area might make him feel isolated and more vulnerable. No prior convictions are a plus but not enough on their own. Substance use, especially if it's recent or severe, could be a significant risk factor.\n\nPutting this together, I think the recidivism is high because he's young, living alone, has no previous convictions, and substance abuse is affecting his mood. The confidence should reflect that these factors are strong indicators of future criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young age\", \"high\", \"affects recidivism\"),\n    (\"living alone in an urban area\", \"high\", \"increases vulnerability to reoffending\"),\n    (\"no prior convictions\", \"medium\", \"but not the highest risk factor\"),\n    (\"substance use, especially recent or severe\", \"high\", \"stronger risk factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
