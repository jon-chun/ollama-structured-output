Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as mixed race. That might be a bit confusing, but maybe it means she has some background from different cultures or something like that. She's been arrested five times and convicted, so that's pretty serious. Being mixed race could add another layer of complexity because people from different backgrounds sometimes have unique behaviors.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 pounds. That seems about right for an 18-year-old. She never married yet, which is interesting. Currently living alone in a rural area with her adoptive parents means she might be dealing with some isolation or stress from not having family around.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. That could mean she's working part-time or hasn't decided on a career yet. She's not involved in jobs during the past year, so maybe she's looking for something new or is self-employed? But wait, she used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That's concerning because drug use can lead to mental health issues.\n\nShe considers God has nothing to do with her personal life. That might mean she's not religiously oriented or doesn't believe in free will, which could affect how she handles her situation. She's raised by an adoptive parent and lives in a rural area, so maybe there are some social factors at play here.\n\nPutting this all together: being arrested five times is a clear risk. Mixed race might introduce some unique behaviors that could be problematic. Not having a stable family or living alone adds stress. Drug use and mental health issues from the past month suggest she's in a vulnerable state. The lack of religious belief might limit her options for support, which could make things harder.\n\nI think all these factors together increase the risk of rearrest within three years. So, I'd say the prediction is YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"mixed race\", \"medium\", \"Her background and potential unique behaviors from different cultures may add complexity to her situation\"),\n    (\"arrested five times\", \"high\", \"This significant number of arrests indicates a serious risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"She might be working part-time or pursuing a career that hasn't been decided yet, which could affect her ability to reintegrate into society\"),\n    (\"lived with adoptive parent(s) in rural area\", \"low\", \"This isolation and lack of family support may contribute to stress and potential reoffending\"),\n    (\"not married\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be stressful, especially without a stable family, which might affect her ability to seek help or reintegrate\"),\n    (\"used drugs (marijuana, cocaine)\", \"high\", \"This history suggests she may have mental health issues that could impact her ability to reenter the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"not felt depressed over last month\", \"low\", \"Her recent mood hasn't shown signs of improvement, which might make it harder for her to seek help or reintegrate\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
