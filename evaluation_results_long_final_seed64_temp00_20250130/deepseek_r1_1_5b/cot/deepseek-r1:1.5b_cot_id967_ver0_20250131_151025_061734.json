    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. He's a White person with a high school diploma, never enrolled in college, has two jobs, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine), and doesn't feel depressed over the past month. He lives alone, was raised by his parents in a small rural household, and considers God involved.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is 19, which might indicate some underlying issues like substance abuse or stress from living alone. High school diploma without college completion could mean he's not prepared for the job market. Two jobs suggest he has some stability but maybe isn't fully engaged in them.\n\nHe's a 5'8\" man and 140 lbs, which is on the lower side for his height. Living alone might lead to stress or feelings of isolation. Using drugs four years ago could be concerning if there were underlying issues like substance abuse. Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests he's managing emotions well.\n\nHis upbringing in a small rural household with two parents might have influenced his behavior, especially regarding substance use and family dynamics. Considering God involved could mean he's seeking spiritual support or has some faith background that might influence recidivism rates.\n\nNow, weighing these factors: substance abuse is a significant risk factor. High school without college might be a concern for job readiness. Living alone and feeling isolated could add to recidivism. Not feeling depressed suggests better emotional health. God involvement might indicate he's seeking support or has some faith background.\n\nPutting it all together, the person seems at high risk of rearrest due to substance abuse, lack of education, living alone, and feelings of isolation. The low depression level and stable upbringing suggest a higher chance of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance use\", \"high\", \"substance abuse history over the past four years\"),\n    (\"no college completion\", \"medium\", \"low education level without further education\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"high\", \"feeling of isolation and loneliness\"),\n    (\"feeling of isolation and loneliness\", \"high\", \"feeling of being left behind and not part of a family unit\"),\n    (\"low depression level\", \"low\", \"manageable emotional state over the past month\"),\n    (\"stable upbringing in rural household with two parents\", \"low\", \"no significant family dynamics issues affecting behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
