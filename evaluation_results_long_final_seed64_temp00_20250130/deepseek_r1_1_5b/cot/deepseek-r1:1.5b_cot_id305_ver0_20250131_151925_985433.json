He's an 5'8\" guy, not married, living alone, in school now, has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, never felt depressed over the last month, and lived with his parents back when he was young in a family of size 4 in an urban area. He's considering God for personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is an 18-year-old, which might indicate higher risk because they're more likely to engage in criminal behavior as they mature. But since he's been arrested twice without conviction, that's a significant negative factor. His age and lack of education could contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's never married, so no family support system for him to rely on. That might make him more prone to criminal activities because there's no one around to help or provide support. He's living alone, which is another risk factor\u2014people are more likely to commit crimes when they're isolated and have little support.\n\nHe's in school now, so he's probably not available for jobs or further education. That could lead to lower earnings and less opportunities, increasing the likelihood of recidivism. He has used drugs in the past four years, which is a clear criminal history. drug use can be a strong indicator of future criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the last month, but he's been using drugs, so maybe his mood could have changed or influenced his decision to commit crimes. But since he's not feeling depressed, that might mitigate some of the stress from his past actions.\n\nLived with both parents in a family of size 4 in an urban area when he was young. Urban areas can be risky because of higher crime rates and potential exposure to criminal activities. That could contribute to recidivism as well.\n\nHis behavior is driven by drug use, which is a clear risk factor. substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior over time. His lack of support from family and friends might make him more susceptible to criminal activities.\n\nHe's considering God for personal issues, but that seems like an unusual way to address his problems. It might not be the most effective or healthy approach in terms of recidivism risk assessment.\n\nPutting it all together, he has multiple risk factors: past criminal history, age and lack of support, current education level, living alone, drug use, and possibly family dynamics. These factors make him a high-risk individual for recidivism over the next three years.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_crime\", \"high\", \"he has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted\"),\n    (\"age_and_support\", \"high\", \"he's an 18-year-old and has never married, living alone, in school now, with a family of size 4 in an urban area\"),\n    (\"current_education_level\", \"medium\", \"he's enrolled in school at the present moment\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"he's currently living alone\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"he has used drugs in the past four years\"),\n    (\"family_dynamics\", \"medium\", \"lived with both parents in a family of size 4 in an urban area when he was young\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
