    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this young Hispanic female. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old, which is pretty young. That might mean there's less time to recover from past mistakes, but since she's never been convicted yet, maybe that's not too bad. She's Hispanic and living alone, which could be a risk because being alone in a family can lead to feelings of isolation and possibly substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nShe's 5 feet tall and weighs 145 lbs, which is on the lower side for her age. That might indicate she's not very active physically yet. She has no jobs and hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but most of that time she's been feeling down. The fact that she's lived with both parents in a small household in an urban area could mean she's dealing with some stress or uncertainty.\n\nShe's a high school graduate without college enrollment, which might suggest she's not fully prepared for the next steps in her education. She's never married and is living alone, so maybe she hasn't had time to build relationships that could help with recidivism. The lack of substance use throughout the past four years makes me think about possible drug-related issues or substance abuse problems.\n\nPutting it all together, even though she's been arrested three times without conviction, her current circumstances\u2014age, living alone, no jobs, and feelings of downness\u2014seem like potential risks to recidivism. The urban living might contribute to stress, but the lack of substance use suggests possible underlying issues that could lead to reoffending.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because she's in a vulnerable situation with limited resources, no prior substance abuse, and feelings of isolation. However, I should consider her age and the fact that recidivism rates can vary by age group. Maybe it's on the higher side but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"low\", \"She is a young person with limited resources and no prior substance abuse history, which may contribute to lower recidivism rates.\",\n     \"Young age, limited resources, no prior substance use\"),\n    (\"medium\", \"Living alone in an urban household can lead to stress and uncertainty, but the lack of substance use suggests potential underlying issues that could affect recidivism.\",\n     \"Living alone, urban living, low substance use\"),\n    (\"high\", \"She has lived with both parents in a small household, which may contribute to feelings of isolation and uncertainty. The combination of age, limited resources, and no prior substance abuse history makes her at higher risk for recidivism.\",\n     \"Age, limited resources, no prior substance use\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 0 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
