    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual based on the factors provided. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old Black male who has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a significant risk because recidivism rates are usually higher in certain groups. He's 5'5\" and 145 lbs, which is on the lower side for his age, so maybe that's not too bad.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which might make him feel isolated or lonely. That could affect his ability to form strong relationships and support networks, which are important for recidivism. But I'm not sure how much of a risk this is yet.\n\nHe's in school now, so he has some academic support. This could help with reintegrating into society after release. However, if he's struggling academically or has other issues, that might increase his risk.\n\nHe's 1 job during the year but hasn't used any drugs in the past four years. He's had a tough time feeling down lately and nothing feels right. This could indicate underlying issues like anxiety or depression, which are common in recidivism. But I'm not sure how much of a risk this is.\n\nHe's from a rural household with five parents, so he might have less support from family members compared to urban areas. That could make him feel isolated and more vulnerable to recidivism. However, if he has access to resources or support systems, that might mitigate some of the risks.\n\nOverall, I think this individual is at a moderate risk for rearrest. He's young, single, and from a rural background, which can affect his ability to reintegrate into society. But with some support systems in place, it seems manageable.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"single\", \"medium\", \"he may feel isolated and less likely to seek help\"),\n    (\"rural household\", \"low\", \"less family support and resources\"),\n    (\"no family support\", \"low\", \"he may lack access to community or professional help\"),\n    (\"no job history\", \"low\", \"his career stability could affect his reintegrative efforts\"),\n    (\"no substance use history\", \"medium\", \"his recent emotional struggles might indicate underlying issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
