    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. He's a White person, not married yet, living alone. He has a high school diploma, not in college, and he's used drugs (marjuana) in the past four years without feeling depressed over the last month. He comes from a household of five with rural roots and considers God involved.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is 19, which might be on the younger side, but not too old for criminal behavior. He's an adult, so that could increase recidivism rates compared to minors or teenagers. He's a White male, which might have some racial/ethnic factors affecting his behavior, though I'm not sure how significant that is.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone, which could mean he's more isolated. Isolation can lead to higher recidivism because there are fewer support systems around him. That seems like a risk factor.\n\nHe has two jobs during the year, so he might have some financial stability but not necessarily lower criminal behavior. However, if he's struggling with his job or living alone, that could be a concern. But I'm not sure how much that affects recidivism rates.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years without feeling depressed over the last month. This is concerning because substance use can lead to various issues like addiction, mental health problems, and criminal behavior. It might increase recidivism chances.\n\nHe comes from a household of five with rural roots. That could mean he has fewer support systems or resources available for him, which might contribute to higher recidivism rates. Rural areas might have different social dynamics compared to urban areas.\n\nHe considers God involved, which is interesting. While personal beliefs can influence behavior, especially in the context of criminal activities, I'm not sure how significant that factor is on its own. It's more about his spiritual beliefs rather than external risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be substance use (marijuana), living alone, and possibly isolation from support systems due to being rural. These could increase recidivism rates compared to other risk factors like substance abuse or financial instability.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact weight each factor has on recidivism. But I think substance use is a big one because it's a serious issue that can lead to addiction and criminal behavior. Living alone might also be significant due to isolation, especially if he's struggling financially or with his job. Rural living could add another layer of isolation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the recidivism risk seems high. I'll assign each factor a medium weight because they are serious issues that can significantly impact someone's ability to rejoin society without further consequences.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"marijuana use is a serious issue that can lead to addiction and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"living alone can increase recidivism rates due to isolation and lack of support systems\"),\n    (\"isolation\", \"medium\", \"rural living may contribute to higher recidivism by limiting social support and resources\"),\n    (\"financial_stability\", \"low\", \"two jobs might provide some financial stability but could also lead to other issues like job insecurity or substance abuse\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
