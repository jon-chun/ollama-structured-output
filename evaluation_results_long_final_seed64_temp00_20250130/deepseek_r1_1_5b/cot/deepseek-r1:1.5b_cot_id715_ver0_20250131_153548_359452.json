    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. She's an 18-year-old, White, living alone with no high school diploma or GED. She's never married and has a family history of living in rural areas with her parents. She used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) and doesn't feel depressed over the past month. She's lived with her parents since she was 13.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is an 18-year-old, which might indicate a higher risk of substance abuse because they're in their prime for starting or reliving drug use. They've been arrested twice but not convicted, so there's some uncertainty about the legal implications. Living alone with no family seems risky because it can lead to isolation and dependency.\n\nShe has never married, which is concerning as it might mean she's more likely to start substance use without support. The household size of 5 in a rural area could contribute to living conditions that are difficult for someone who hasn't had much exposure to stress or social interaction. She used drugs in the past four years and doesn't feel depressed over the last month, which is interesting because drug use can sometimes lead to feelings of helplessness or depression.\n\nShe's lived with her parents since she was 13, which might have set up some family dynamics that could be challenging for someone who hasn't had much exposure. She has held 5 jobs during the year, but without a high school diploma or GED, it might make obtaining a job easier in the future, though it's still risky.\n\nPutting this all together, I think she's at a higher risk because of her age, lack of support network, living alone, and substance use history. The arrest twice but not convicted adds uncertainty about the legal outcome. Living alone with no family might make it harder to cope with the stress of being isolated. Her drug use and lack of feelings of helplessness could indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\n\nI'm leaning towards yes because she's in a vulnerable situation with substance abuse, living alone, and possibly facing some isolation or uncertainty about her future. The arrest twice but not convicted adds another layer of risk. So the prediction is YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted, indicating a history of substance abuse that may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"lack_of_support_network\", \"Living alone with no family and possibly facing uncertainty about legal outcomes adds vulnerability to recidivism\"),\n    (\"isolation_and_stress\", \"Living in rural areas could exacerbate stress and isolation, increasing the risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"drugs_and_feeling_helplessness\", \"Her use of drugs and lack of feelings of helplessness over the past month may indicate a higher risk of relapse or re-arrest\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"Having held 5 jobs without a high school diploma or GED might make obtaining future employment easier, though it's still risky\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
