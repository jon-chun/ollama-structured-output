    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. He's an 18-year-old, White, living alone with his parents in a rural area. He used marijuana and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. He's lived with his parents other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents for two people in a household of size two.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is an 18-year-old, which might indicate higher risk because they're more likely to engage in criminal behavior as they get older. He's White, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's more likely to reciditate; it could be influenced by other factors like socioeconomic status or family background.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't convicted. This is a significant risk factor because being arrested means he's facing the consequences of his actions. The fact that he's never been convicted might suggest he's not motivated enough, but I'm not sure if that's a strong indicator.\n\nHis age and living alone in a small household could be another risk factor. Young people are more likely to engage in criminal behavior because they're developing their skills and have less supervision. Living alone might mean less support from family members, which could increase recidivism rates.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't indicated anything negative about his behavior. This is a bit concerning because marijuana use can sometimes be linked to other issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. However, since he's never felt depressed over the past month, that might mitigate some of those concerns.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college, which could mean he's more likely to work full-time and have stable employment, reducing his risk of recidition. His GED certificate shows he has some education, but without a degree, he might be at a lower risk compared to someone with a high school diploma or higher.\n\nThe person considered that God had something to do with his personal life is interesting. This could imply a spiritual component to his behavior, which might not necessarily increase recidivism rates but could influence how he interacts with others.\n\nPutting this all together, the main risk factors seem to be his age, living alone in a small household, and being arrested once without conviction. These factors are significant enough that they should be considered when predicting recidivism. The person's lack of substance abuse history and stable family life might help mitigate some risks, but the arrest and lack of conviction still present challenges.\n\nI think the prediction is YES because these risk factors significantly increase his likelihood of reciditing. However, I'm not entirely sure if all these factors are equally impactful or if there are other mitigating factors at play.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"The person is an 18-year-old, which may indicate higher risk as they develop criminal behavior over time\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone in a small household could increase recidivism rates due to less supervision and potential isolation\"),\n    (\"arrested_once\", \"high\", \"Being arrested once without conviction suggests significant risk factors that need to be addressed\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"low\", \"No history of substance abuse indicates fewer risks related to that issue\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"medium\", \"Stable family life may provide emotional and financial support, which could help mitigate risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
