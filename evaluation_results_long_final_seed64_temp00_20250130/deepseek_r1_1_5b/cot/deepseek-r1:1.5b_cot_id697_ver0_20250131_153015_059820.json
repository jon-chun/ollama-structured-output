    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest after three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That might be a bit of a stereotype, but maybe it affects his behavior. He's been arrested six times and has been convicted, so that's a clear risk factor. Being a minor with no college education makes him more vulnerable to criminal behavior because he can't learn from adults.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. That's not too tall or heavy for his age, which might indicate he's in a stable environment where he can handle the stress of being caught multiple times. But I'm not sure how that translates to recidivism risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That could mean he has less support system, but it also gives him more freedom. However, living alone might lead to issues like domestic abuse or neglect if someone isn't there for him. But since he's a minor, maybe that's not as much of an issue.\n\nHe's 22 and hasn't had any jobs yet. That could mean he's looking for work, which might make him more susceptible to recidivism because he can't afford to stay in jail or face the consequences of being caught again. But if he has some job experience, that could mitigate that risk.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine, so that's a clear drug use history. Drug use is often associated with higher recidivism rates because it can lead to addiction and mental health issues later on.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That might indicate he's more likely to stay in jail or face the consequences of being caught again because he's not feeling down, which could make him more vulnerable.\n\nHe lived with adults other than biological parents in a rural area for a household of size two. That means he has less support and might be exposed to different environments that could lead to recidivism. But since it's rural, maybe there are fewer opportunities for criminal activity because people are less likely to commit crimes in rural areas.\n\nHe considers God nothing to do with his personal life. That seems like a red flag because if someone is influenced by their faith, they might be more prone to certain behaviors or decisions that could lead to recidivism. But I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be being a minor with no college education (low risk), having been arrested six times and convicted (medium risk), living alone which might give him more freedom but also possible issues (medium risk), drug use history (high risk because drug use is linked to recidivism), and possibly living in a rural area which could limit opportunities (medium risk). \n\nSo, the overall prediction would be that he has a moderate risk of rearrest after three years. The confidence level would be medium because there are several factors contributing but not an overwhelming one.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"minor with no college education\", \"low\", \"age and lack of formal education make him more vulnerable to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"arrested six times and convicted\", \"medium\", \"consistent criminal history is a clear risk factor\"),\n    (\"living alone in a rural area\", \"medium\", \"less support system but also possible issues like domestic abuse\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana, cocaine)\", \"high\", \"drugs are often associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"no job experience\", \"medium\", \"might make him more susceptible to recidivism if he has work experience\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
