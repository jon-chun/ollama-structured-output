    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how recidivism works for this 19-year-old woman. She's a White female who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. She's 5 feet 6 inches, 165 pounds, never married, living alone, has a high school diploma in college, and she's lived with her parents in a small household for four years. She usedcocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. At a young age, she lived with both biological parents in an urban area, and God is involved.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor. The person has low criminal history because they've been arrested once but not convicted. That's a strong indicator of potential recidivism. They're 19, which might mean they have some life experience, but it's still relatively young. Low education level and being in college could affect their ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nShe's single, living alone, and raised by her parents who are both around her. That's a stable environment, which is good for recidivism risk assessment because it reduces stress and provides emotional support. The fact that she usedcocaine suggests she might have some substance use disorder, but this isn't directly related to criminal behavior.\n\nShe's lived with her parents in a small household for four years, which is manageable. She doesn't feel depressed over the past month, so there's no immediate mental health issue that could worsen recidivism risk. The urban living environment might offer some opportunities for integration but also possible challenges if she struggles to adapt.\n\nGod being involved isn't directly related to criminal behavior or recidivism. It's more about personal beliefs and life experiences. So, her religious background doesn't add much to the risk assessment.\n\nPutting it all together, her criminal history is a big factor\u2014only one arrest but not conviction. She has low education and experience, which might make her less likely to reintegrate into society. The stable environment from living alone and raising by parents could help her adjust. However, she's still in a vulnerable position because she's 19, which can sometimes lead to higher recidivism rates compared to younger individuals.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk of recidivism because of the low criminal history, moderate life experience, stable environment, and manageable substance use. But I should consider that her age might still pose some challenges. However, given all these factors, it's more likely than not that she will recidivate.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"low\", \"criminal history is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\", \"she has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted\"),\n    (\"medium\", \"low education and experience suggest manageable life experience\", \"she's in college and raised by her parents\"),\n    (\"moderate\", \"stable environment from living alone and raising by parents\", \"single, living alone, raised by parents\"),\n    (\"low\", \"manageable substance use disorder (cocaine) suggests lower recidivism risk\", \"used cocaine in the past four years\"),\n    (\"low\", \"age 19 may still pose some challenges but not as high as younger individuals\", \"she's 19\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
