    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old Black female who has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a high risk because being in jail multiple times without conviction can be serious. I think that's a high risk factor.\n\nNext, her age is young, and she's living alone with no family around her. That might make her more vulnerable to criminal behavior because there's less support from others. So, that's another high risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That could mean she lacks the skills needed for higher education or employment, which might contribute to recidivism. I'm leaning towards this being a medium risk factor because it's not impossible but also not very common.\n\nHer family size is six, so she's living with five others. That might give her more support systems and potentially make her less likely to commit crimes alone. So, maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years or felt depressed over the last month. Those are both negative indicators of substance abuse and mental health issues. Both being high risk factors because they can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal life, which is interesting but not directly a risk factor unless it affects her decision-making or behavior. I'm not sure about that one yet; maybe it's more of an influence on other factors rather than a direct risk.\n\nPutting this all together, the main high-risk factors are being in jail multiple times without conviction, living alone, and lacking education. The low-risk factors include family size and substance use/depression. So overall, she has significant risks but also some manageable ones too.\n\nI think her recidivism is likely to be a medium risk because while there are some serious issues, the person isn't in an extremely dangerous situation. But I'm not entirely sure if it's high or medium. Maybe I should consider that being in jail multiple times without conviction is more severe than just living alone or having low education.\n\nWait, maybe she's already in a situation where she's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. That could be a significant risk because each arrest might carry its own weight. So perhaps the recidivism rate is higher for someone who has been in jail multiple times without conviction compared to someone who's just lived in a single-parent home.\n\nI'm also thinking about how family size affects this person. With five others around her, she might have more support systems and potentially less criminal behavior. But if she's living alone, that could make it harder for her to commit crimes on her own.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the recidivism rate is likely medium because there are some serious issues like being in jail multiple times without conviction, living alone, and lacking education. However, the person isn't in an extremely dangerous situation, so maybe it's a bit higher than average but not excessively so.\n\nI'm still a bit unsure about whether it's high or medium. Maybe I should look up some statistics on recidivism rates for Black individuals who have been arrested multiple times without conviction and living alone. But since I don't have access to that right now, I'll go with the factors I've considered: significant risks but not impossible.\n\nSo, my final assessment is that this person has a medium risk of rearrest due to being in jail three times without conviction, living alone, lacking education, and having substance use/depression issues. The family size and mental health status are also contributing factors, but they aren't the main ones driving recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"being in jail multiple times without conviction\", \"high\", \"Significant risk of criminal behavior due to repeated arrests without conviction\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"high\", \"Potential vulnerability to criminal behavior from a lack of family support and social isolation\"),\n    (\"lack of education (no diploma or GED)\", \"medium\", \"Moderate risk of criminal behavior due to limited skills and potential for higher education\"),\n    (\"family size (six people living with five others)\", \"low\", \"Reduced vulnerability compared to smaller families as there are more support systems available\"),\n    (\"substance use/depression issues\", \"high\", \"Negative indicators of substance abuse and mental health, which can contribute to criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
