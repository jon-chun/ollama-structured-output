    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. Let me start by breaking down each factor they provided.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a significant risk because being arrested again could lead to serious consequences. His age is young, which might mean there's less time to adjust or change his behavior. He's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 170 lbs, which are pretty average measurements for his height.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone, which might indicate he's more independent. But being single could also be a risk if he feels lonely or lacks support from others. His education is limited to high school diploma and not in college, so he hasn't had much formal training. That could make him less capable of handling the consequences of rearrest.\n\nHe has one job during the year but hasn't used it yet. This might mean he's somewhat employed but not fully utilized. His past drug use isn't mentioned, which is a concern because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month either, so his mental health status is stable.\n\nAt a young age, living in a household of five means there are likely other family members around him who might influence his behavior or decisions. His consideration of God's role could be an interesting angle, but it's not explicitly stated how that would affect his risk factors.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors: arrest history is high (2 times), lack of conviction, age and status, job history, substance use, mental health, household size, and belief in God. Each of these contributes to a higher risk of rearrest.\n\nI think each factor adds up to make him more likely to rearrest. The arrest history being so high suggests he's at risk. His lack of conviction means he hasn't been cleared, which is another big red flag. His age and status as an underdog might also play a role in his behavior changes over time.\n\nPutting it all together, I'm leaning towards him having a high risk of rearrest within the next three years. The confidence level should be quite high because each factor points to potential criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"being arrested twice but not convicted indicates significant risk\"),\n    (\"lack of conviction\", \"high\", \"failure to clear previous arrests is a critical concern\"),\n    (\"age and status\", \"medium\", \"young age and living alone may influence behavior changes over time\"),\n    (\"job history\", \"low\", \"only one job during the year suggests partial employment potential\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"unknown\", \"no information on past drug use, which is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"stable\", \"no indication of depression in the past month, suggesting mental health stability\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"living in a household of five may influence family dynamics and behavior changes\"),\n    (\" belief in God\", \"unknown\", \"no explicit mention of how this belief would affect risk factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
