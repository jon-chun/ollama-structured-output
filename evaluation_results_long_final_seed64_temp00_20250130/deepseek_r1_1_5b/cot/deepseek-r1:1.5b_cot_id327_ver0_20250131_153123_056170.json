    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this young Black female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old who identifies as Black. That might be a sign that she could face more serious issues later on because of her background. But I'm not sure if that's a high or low risk yet.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting because it means she's facing some consequences, but the outcome isn't certain. Maybe this arrest adds to her risk factors.\n\nHer age is 18, which is relatively young for someone who's lived with both parents in a small household. Urban living might mean she has more responsibilities or could be exposed to different environments. But I'm not sure how that affects recidivism.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That's definitely a risk factor because without education, it's harder to get jobs or understand the law better. Maybe this is a low risk yet.\n\nShe hasn't married and is living alone. That could mean she has fewer family members around her, which might affect support systems. But I'm not sure how that ties into recidivism.\n\nHer past drug use in the last four years includes marijuana and some time feeling down. This seems like a significant issue because substance abuse can lead to mental health problems and criminal behavior. That's probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. Also, she felt down recently, which might have contributed to her substance use. So that adds another layer of risk.\n\nShe's from a household of size 10 and lives in an urban area. That could mean more stress or different living conditions compared to smaller households. But I'm not sure how that translates into recidivism risk.\n\nShe considers God to have something to do with her personal issues, which is interesting but maybe just another way of looking at the problem rather than a significant factor.\n\nPutting it all together: she's young, Black, has been arrested once, has substance abuse problems, and lives in an urban household. These factors seem like they could increase recidivism risk. However, without more information on her specific circumstances or how these issues have affected her, it's hard to assign a precise weight.\n\nI think the prediction should be YES because she's at higher risk due to her background, substance use, and living situation. The confidence level would be medium because while there are several factors, they aren't all extremely high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black background\", \"medium\", \"Her identity could influence her behavior and opportunities\"),\n    (\"Arrested once\", \"low\", \"The outcome isn't certain but may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma\", \"low\", \"Lack of education makes it harder to understand law and make informed decisions\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Limited support systems could affect her ability to handle challenges\"),\n    (\"Substance abuse in past four years (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Significant issue contributing to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Recent down feeling affecting substance use\", \"high\", \"Additional risk factor from mental health issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
