    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old who identifies as White. He's been arrested three times and has a history of convictions. That seems like a high risk because being caught multiple times is serious. But I'm not sure if it's medium or high yet.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 145 lbs. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own, but combined with other factors, maybe it adds up to something significant.\n\nHis age makes him a potential problem, especially since he's enrolled in school now. School-age children are often at higher risk for recidivism because they're more vulnerable to reoffending.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That's a big plus because being single reduces the chances of someone trying to break up with someone else. But I'm not sure how that plays into recidivism risk.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which means he might have some underlying issues or be more likely to face challenges at school. This could contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone, so his family situation isn't an issue here. That's a plus for recidivism risk because being single reduces the likelihood of someone trying to break up with someone else.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone, which I think lowers his recidivism risk compared to someone who might be in a different family situation. But I'm not sure how much that affects the overall risk.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using substances can lead to reoffending, so this is a significant factor. However, it's also important to consider other factors like substance abuse history versus drug use.\n\nHis family size was five when he was young, which might have influenced his behavior or decision-making in ways that could affect recidivism risk. But again, I'm not sure how much that plays into the overall risk.\n\nPutting this all together, he's been arrested multiple times and has a history of convictions, which is a strong indicator of high risk. His age, being single, enrolled in school\u2014these factors contribute to higher recidivism rates. However, his drug use and lack of depression are also significant risks. But I'm not sure if they outweigh the other factors.\n\nI think he's at a medium risk because while there are some high-risk factors like multiple arrests and substance abuse, the other factors like being single and enrolled in school make it more likely than average. However, I'm still not entirely certain about his overall recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests\", \"medium\", \"being caught multiple times is serious but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_history\", \"medium\", \"using substances can lead to reoffending, which is a significant factor\"),\n    (\"single_status\", \"low\", \"being single reduces the likelihood of someone trying to break up with someone else\"),\n    (\"enrolled_in_school\", \"low\", \"school-age children are more vulnerable to recidivism due to school environment and potential issues\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"a family size that doesn't significantly impact risk compared to others\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"Medium\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
