    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He's never been convicted of anything but has been arrested twice. That seems like a low risk because recidivism rates are usually lower in those age groups. But I should consider other factors too.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That doesn't seem too high, so maybe not a significant risk factor. His height is average, which might be associated with less criminal behavior, but I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marrying someone could increase criminal behavior because of social interactions, but since he's never married, it might be lower. Also, living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which could affect recidivism rates. But again, I'm not certain about this.\n\nHis education is a high school diploma in a 4-year college. That means he's at least somewhat educated, which might indicate better opportunities and less likely to drop out or engage in criminal behavior. However, higher education doesn't always correlate with lower recidivism rates because it can lead to more stable jobs and fewer opportunities for criminal activities.\n\nHe has held one job during the year but hasn't mentioned any specific role. That could be a risk factor if he's not actively engaging in criminal activities or if his job is related to criminal behavior. But without specifics, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. This is concerning because drug use can significantly increase recidivism rates. However, I should consider other factors like substance abuse patterns and how he managed his addiction. If he was on medication or had a stable system, that might mitigate some risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, but it's not directly linked in this case. It's important to note that depression is a separate issue from recidivism.\n\nHis upbringing: lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4. This suggests a stable environment, which might reduce recidivism because there are fewer opportunities for criminal activities and more time spent on education and family responsibilities. However, it doesn't necessarily mean lower recidivism rates; it's just one factor.\n\nHis age is young, so he may have less experience with criminal behavior. But that's not a risk factor per se, but rather an opportunity to learn. Still, it could contribute to lower recidivism rates in the past because there might be fewer opportunities for reoffending.\n\nPutting all these together: He's from a stable family, has some education, hasn't been convicted yet, and has low drug use history. These factors suggest a lower risk of rearrest compared to others with similar backgrounds but different patterns of substance use or family environment.\n\nI think the overall risk is moderate because he's young, has some education, and hasn't engaged in significant criminal activities. But I'm not entirely sure if it's high or medium. Maybe it's on the higher side because he's a 21-year-old with no prior convictions but could still face some recidivism.\n\nWait, but considering that he's from a stable family and has low drug use, maybe his risk is lower than someone from a more unstable environment. So perhaps it's medium or even slightly high.\n\nI'm not entirely confident about the exact weight on each factor, so I might lean towards a moderate risk. But without more specific data, it's hard to say for sure.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with a small household of four members contributes to lower recidivism rates as there are fewer opportunities for criminal behavior and more time spent on education and family responsibilities.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma in a 4-year college suggests some level of education, which may indicate better opportunities and less likely to drop out or engage in criminal activities.
