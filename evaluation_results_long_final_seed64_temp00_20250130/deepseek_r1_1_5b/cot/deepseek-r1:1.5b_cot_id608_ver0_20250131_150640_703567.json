    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old, which is young but not too old. She's white, which might be a positive sign in terms of cultural factors and possibly lower crime rates in her community. She's been arrested three times and convicted, so that's a clear history of criminal behavior. That alone should raise red flags because being caught again could indicate a pattern or lack of change.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 120 lbs. That seems about right for her age, but I'm not sure how weight affects recidivism. Maybe in certain communities, weight is a factor, but it doesn't immediately jump out as a risk factor.\n\nHer height isn't an issue here; she's tall enough to be arrested without any immediate concerns. She's never been married and lives alone, which might mean less social support or opportunities for reoffending. That could be a significant risk because being alone in a community with others who may have different recidivism rates can make it harder for someone to reintegrate.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This is concerning because lower education levels are often associated with higher crime rates, especially among certain groups like minority populations. But since she's white, maybe that mitigates some of the issues? I'm not sure about that yet.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs during the year, but it doesn't specify what those jobs were. If they're in high-crime areas or if there are specific industries where crime is higher, that could be a risk factor. But without knowing the specifics, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using drugs can lead to recidivism because it might affect mental health, which can influence behavior. Not feeling depressed could be a positive aspect, but using substances is still concerning. It might indicate underlying issues that aren't being addressed.\n\nShe's lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3. That's a small family, which might mean less support for reoffending and more opportunities for criminal activity. This seems like a significant risk because smaller communities often have different recidivism rates compared to larger ones.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother. That could be a vulnerable period where the individual is still developing emotionally and may face higher risks of reoffending due to lack of support or exposure to criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: She's been arrested three times, which is a clear pattern. She's single, which might make recidivism harder because there are fewer opportunities for reintegration. She's used drugs, which can contribute to recidivism despite not feeling depressed. The family size and living situation with her biological mother could also be significant risks. However, she has some positive aspects like a stable environment and drug use.\n\nI think the risk factors are present but maybe manageable. The single status and small family might make it harder, but the clear criminal history is still concerning. I'm leaning towards yes because there's a pattern of past crimes, living alone, using drugs, and possibly being in a vulnerable situation.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"single_status\", \"medium\", \"She has lived with her biological mother in a small family setting, which can make recidivism harder\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"A household of size 3 may offer fewer opportunities for reoffending compared to larger communities\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Using substances like marijuana and cocaine can contribute to recidivism despite not feeling depressed\"),\n    (\"lived_with_blood_parent\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother is a vulnerable period that may increase reoffending risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
