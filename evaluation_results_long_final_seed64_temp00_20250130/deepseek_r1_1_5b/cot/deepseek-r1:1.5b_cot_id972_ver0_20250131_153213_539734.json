    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. She's an 18-year-old from a white background, living alone with no kids, never married, and has a job history of two jobs. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, isn't in college, and hasn't used drugs or felt depressed recently. She comes from a household of four with her biological mother and is living in an urban area.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. The person is 18, which might indicate some underlying stress or anxiety, but since she's never married and lives alone, maybe that's mitigated. Being white could be a positive sign for certain groups, but overall, it's a diverse background. She's from an urban area, so maybe that affects her social environment.\n\nShe's been arrested once, which is concerning because recidivism rates can vary by jurisdiction. But since she hasn't been convicted, the risk isn't zero. The fact that she's never married might mean she's more independent, but without a high school diploma or GED, she might face some challenges in the workforce.\n\nLiving alone could be risky if there are issues with living situations affecting her mental health. Not using drugs and not feeling depressed over the past month suggests she's managing stress, which is positive. But since she's from an urban area, maybe that environment has its own risks.\n\nPutting it all together, while some factors like being from a diverse background or never married might be positive, the lack of education, living alone, and possibly living in an urban area could contribute to recidivism. The arrest history is significant, but since she's not convicted, the risk isn't entirely absent.\n\nI think the overall prediction should be YES because there are some underlying risks that could lead to recidivism, especially considering her education level and living situation.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"diverse background\", \"medium\", \"a diverse background may mitigate some risks\"),\n    (\"never married\", \"low\", \"independence from marriage may reduce stress\"),\n    (\"urban area\", \"medium\", \" urban environment could present challenges\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma or GED\", \"medium\", \"lack of education may affect career opportunities\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"single living might impact social support and mental health\"),\n    (\"not using drugs in past four years\", \"low\", \"manageable stress from substance use\"),\n    (\"not feeling depressed over last month\", \"low\", \"manageable stress from mood issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
