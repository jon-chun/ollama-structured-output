    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old who identifies as White. That might be a positive sign because it's common in many communities. He's been arrested three times and has convictions, which is concerning. I should note that he's had multiple arrests, so his recidivism risk is higher than someone with fewer convictions.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 135 lbs. That doesn't seem too bad for a 18-year-old, but it's not extremely tall or heavy either. His height isn't an issue here, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nHis weight is also within a reasonable range for his age, so no major concerns there.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. That could be a risk factor because living with someone who might be a family member or have different expectations can lead to issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. But since he's single, maybe that's less of an issue? I'm not sure yet; I'll need to think about this more.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That might indicate lower education levels, which could be associated with higher recidivism rates because people without proper education might face more challenges later on. But again, it's not clear-cut whether that directly affects his recidivism risk.\n\nHe hasn't had any jobs during the year but has used drugs in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and some time ago he felt down in the dumps, which could be a sign of substance abuse. That's a strong indicator of potential substance use issues, which can lead to criminal behavior. I should include that as a significant risk factor.\n\nHe's from a household of six in a rural area where God isn't involved with his personal life. That might mean he has more freedom and less societal pressure, but it could also be a positive environment for recidivism because people often face more challenges in urban areas. I'll need to weigh that in.\n\nPutting this all together: He's been arrested multiple times, which is a clear sign of recidivism risk. His substance use history shows he might engage in criminal activities again. The living situation and lack of education could present some challenges but aren't definitive risks. However, the drug use is a strong indicator that his recidivism risk is high.\n\nI think the overall prediction should be YES because all these factors point towards a higher likelihood of him rearresting.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which could indicate a higher risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drugs_used\", \"high\", \"he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, indicating potential for criminal activity\"),\n    (\"drugs_used_in_past_month\", \"high\", \"some time ago he felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
