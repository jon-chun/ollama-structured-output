    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this young woman. Let me go through her details step by step.\n\nShe's a 20-year-old female from a white background. She's been arrested three times and convicted, which is pretty concerning. She's married and living with her spouse, so that might give her some support or stability. She has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which could mean she's not fully prepared for the job market yet.\n\nShe's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. That seems about right for her age. She's married, so that might be an asset if she can get a stable job or family. But I'm not sure how that affects recidivism risk.\n\nShe has one job during the year but hasn't held it all of the past four years. That could mean she's underfunded or underpaid for her role. She's used drugs in the past four years, mostly marijuana, and some time back when she felt down and didn't feel up to help others. That seems like a significant issue because substance use can lead to recidivism.\n\nShe's from a household of six, living with adults other than biological parents. That might mean there are more people around her who could be supportive or provide emotional support. But I'm not sure how that affects her risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with non-biological parents in a household of six. That could give her some support but also make it harder to find a stable job or secure housing. She considers God to have something to do with her personal issues, which is interesting because it adds a spiritual component to her situation.\n\nPutting this all together, I think she's at high risk for rearrest. The number of arrests and convictions is significant. Her substance use history shows a clear pattern that could lead back to recidivism. The family dynamics might also play a role in how she handles her situation. Plus, the fact that she's from a household with other parents adds another layer of support or potential challenge.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about all these factors, but I think they point towards high risk. Maybe I should look into each factor more to see if there are any exceptions or additional considerations.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"Her history of substance use in the past four years indicates a clear pattern that could lead back to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_dynamics\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of six may provide some support but also make it harder to secure a stable job or housing\"),\n    (\"driving_status\", \"medium\", \"She has one job during the year but hasn't held it all of the past four years, suggesting potential underfunding and underpayment for her role\"),\n    (\"family_maintenance\", \"high\", \"Marriage is an asset that could provide stability if she can secure a stable job or family support\"),\n    (\"drinking_history\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested three times and convicted, indicating a significant pattern of substance use that could lead back to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
