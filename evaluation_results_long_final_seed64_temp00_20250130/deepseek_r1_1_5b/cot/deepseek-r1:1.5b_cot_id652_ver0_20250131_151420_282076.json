    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual based on the factors provided. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a significant risk because recidivism rates are usually higher in certain demographics and stages of life. Being Hispanic might also play a role since crime rates vary by race and community background.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch, which is average for his age, and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That doesn't seem too concerning on its own, but combined with other factors like living alone or having never been married, it might increase the risk.\n\nHis height and weight are within normal ranges, so that's not a major issue. He's never married and is living alone, which could mean he has less support network, increasing his chances of reoffending. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which might limit opportunities for higher education or better job prospects. If he doesn't have a degree, it could affect his career and future opportunities, making recidivism more likely. So that's another high risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married, living alone, and has a history of substance use issues (marijuana) and feeling down in the dumps. Substance abuse can lead to reoffending because it affects mental health and motivation. Feeling down in the dumps might also contribute to recidivism by reducing self-esteem and increasing feelings of helplessness.\n\nHe's from an urban household of size 5, which could mean a more stable environment but doesn't necessarily correlate with higher recidivism rates. However, living alone is a significant risk factor because it reduces support systems and increases the likelihood of feeling isolated or vulnerable.\n\nPutting this all together, several factors point to a high risk: his age, previous convictions (though not yet proven), substance use history, living situation, and past downfall. These combine to make rearrest prediction likely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"never married\", \"low\", \"no significant impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"high\", \"increases risk due to isolation and limited support\"),\n    (\"substance use (marijuana) history\", \"medium\", \"history of substance use may affect mental health and motivation, increasing recidivism\"),\n    (\"feeling so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up\", \"low\", \"negative emotional state may reduce self-esteem and increase feelings of helplessness\"),\n    (\"high school diploma but not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"limited career opportunities without higher education can affect job prospects and future opportunities, increasing recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
