    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest. Let me start by breaking down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That seems like a significant risk because being arrested means they're facing legal consequences. I think that's a high risk factor.\n\nNext, his height is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. That doesn't seem too tall or heavy for someone of his age. Maybe he's in a healthy weight range, which could be good. But I'm not sure how this affects recidivism.\n\nHis weight isn't the main issue here; it's more about height. So maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 6 inches tall and 180 lbs, so he's shorter than his previous estimate but still within a healthy range. That might be better for recidivism compared to being taller.\n\nHis weight is 130 lbs, which seems about right for someone of his age. Maybe that's not a major risk factor either.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which could mean he has less support system around him. That might make him more likely to reoffend because there's no one to help him after the arrest. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That means he might not have the skills needed for higher education, which could slow down his recidivism. Maybe that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has held one job during the past year but hasn't mentioned it yet. If they know about his job history, that could be a low risk factor because it shows some stability in his work environment.\n\nHe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. Using drugs can lead to recidivism because it affects mental health, which is a high risk factor. But maybe if he's on a drug-induced trip or has been using them for longer, that could be more concerning.\n\nHe's lived with both biological parents in a household of size 7 and considers God nothing to do with his life personally. That seems like a low risk factor because it shows he's independent and doesn't have family issues affecting him.\n\nPutting this all together, the main high-risk factors are being arrested once, living alone, not having a high school diploma, using drugs, and possibly feeling depressed. The medium risks include height, weight, job history, and possibly drug use. The low risks are his age, weight, living situation, and not having family issues.\n\nSo overall, I think this person has a good chance of rearresting because he's in a stable environment, hasn't used drugs for long, and doesn't have significant issues that would make him more likely to reoffend. But the arrest history and living alone do add some risk factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"being arrested once\", \"medium\", \"arresting someone who has been in custody for a short time is a medium risk factor\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"not having family support can increase recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma or GED\", \"medium\", \"lack of formal education may slow down recidivism\"),\n    (\"using marijuana and cocaine\", \"high\", \"drugs can significantly impact mental health, which is a high risk factor\"),\n    (\"feeling depressed over the past month\", \"medium\", \"depression can affect mood and behavior, increasing recidivism risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
