    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That's not immediately alarming because most people of that age identify with their parents or community, but it could be a sign of underlying issues like poverty or discrimination.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's serious. Two convictions are a lot for someone this young; usually, you need to be at least 18 when you commit a crime. But if he's already in jail, that's a red flag. Also, being convicted means he might have had prior delinquency or substance abuse issues.\n\nHe is 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 190 lbs. That's average for his age, so not particularly concerning. His height isn't an issue here.\n\nHe never married and lives alone. That could indicate financial instability because single people often face higher debt. But it's not a clear sign of criminal behavior unless there are other issues like substance abuse or delinquency.\n\nHis weight is 190 lbs, which is within the healthy range for his age. So that doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. That means he might have had some substance use problems because higher education often correlates with substance abuse issues. But it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs during the year, which is typical for someone of his age without significant issues. His job history doesn't suggest criminal behavior unless there are underlying problems like substance abuse or delinquency.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. That's concerning because substance use can lead to criminal behavior if not managed properly. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign but still needs to be cautious about substance use.\n\nAt 21, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area. Urban living can sometimes indicate higher risks because it might mean more stress or financial strain, especially if someone has substance abuse issues.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life. That's interesting but not necessarily a risk factor unless there are other signs like substance use or delinquency.\n\nPutting all this together: He's young, arrested twice, convicted, high weight, no marriage history, stable job history, substance use, and living in an urban area. These factors suggest he might be at higher risk for criminal behavior, especially if his substance use is severe or there are underlying issues like delinquency.\n\nSo the prediction should be YES with a confidence of 85%.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
