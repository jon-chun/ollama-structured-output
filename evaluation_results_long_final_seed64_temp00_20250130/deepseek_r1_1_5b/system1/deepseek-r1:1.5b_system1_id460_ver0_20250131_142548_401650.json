    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That's interesting because it means he might face some legal consequences, which could be risky if he's caught again.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 204 pounds. That seems about right for a young adult, so not too concerning on that front. His family history is zero marriages, but he's currently living alone. That's a big risk because being single can lead to serious issues like domestic violence, relationship problems, and financial instability.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college, which is good because it shows he's educated enough to handle the law. He's lived with his biological mother in a household of size six for 6 years. That's quite large, so living alone might be risky, especially if he's not used to that situation.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is currently single. That's a significant risk because being single can lead to domestic abuse, relationship issues, and financial problems. He has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's concerning because drug use can have serious health implications, but it doesn't necessarily mean he'll commit a crime.\n\nHe's lived with his biological mother for six years, which is quite large. That could put him at risk of living in unsafe housing or facing domestic abuse if he gets involved. He considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which might be interpreted as seeking redemption or finding peace through religion, but it doesn't address the immediate risks.\n\nPutting this all together, while he's young and hasn't been married, being single can lead to serious issues like domestic abuse and financial problems. His drug use is concerning, though not directly linked to crime. The family history of living alone adds another layer of risk. So overall, I think this person has a high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
