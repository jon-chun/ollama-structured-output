    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's interesting because Hispanic males are often considered a risk group due to their higher rates of crime and substance abuse. But I should check the other factors too.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's a significant number of convictions, which is concerning. Convictions can lead to serious consequences, so that's a red flag.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 185 lbs. While weight isn't directly related to crime risk, it might indicate health issues or stress levels that could affect behavior. However, the other factors seem more critical.\n\nHis age is young, which can lead to substance abuse and criminal behavior. He has never had a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That's a clear sign of potential criminal behavior because higher education often correlates with better opportunities and less risk-taking.\n\nHe has held 5 jobs during the year and used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious health problems and criminal behavior. The fact that he's lived with both parents in a household of size six in an urban area might also indicate stress or strain on his family, which could contribute to substance abuse.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal issues, but I don't know if that translates into actionable risk factors. It's more about spiritual beliefs and doesn't directly impact criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the combination of multiple convictions, young age leading to substance use, lack of education, living in a stressful household, and past drug use seems like a high-risk indicator. The other factors are less concerning compared to these aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
