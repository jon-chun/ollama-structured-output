    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's interesting because being Hispanic can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or mental health issues, but it doesn't inherently make someone a danger figure. I should consider if there are any specific risk factors linked to Hispanic identity that might indicate higher risk.\n\nNext, he has been arrested three times and has been convicted. This is a clear sign of criminal behavior. Convictions can lead to serious consequences, so this definitely adds to the risk assessment.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 pounds. His height and weight are within normal ranges for his age, so there's no immediate physical health concern here.\n\nHis marital status is never married, and he's living alone. This could be a factor if living alone has been linked to mental health issues or criminal behavior in the past, but since he hasn't mentioned anything like that yet, it might not be a high risk indicator.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. While education can sometimes correlate with certain risks, especially in areas where higher education is more common, this doesn't necessarily indicate danger on its own.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches tall, which is within the average height for his age, so no physical health issues here.\n\nHis weight range is also normal, so no concerning signs related to body composition or health.\n\nHe has held one job during the past year and hasn't mentioned any recent changes in employment. This could be a factor if there's been a change in work habits that might affect mental health, but without specific incidents, it's hard to assess risk.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using substances can lead to serious mental health issues, so this is a significant factor pointing towards higher risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size two, which might have been a stable environment without immediate stressors that could contribute to criminal behavior. However, it's worth noting that living with a parent can sometimes be protective if the relationship is healthy and there are no significant issues arising from it.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life. This is interesting because it suggests a spiritual aspect to his behavior or mental state. While this doesn't directly indicate criminal risk, it's worth considering if there could be underlying factors related to faith or spirituality that might contribute to criminal activity in the future.\n\nPutting all these together: He has multiple convictions, which are serious. His weight and height are within normal ranges. However, he hasn't mentioned any recent substance use or depression, but his past drug use is concerning. The mention of living with a biological parent could be protective if the relationship is stable. The spiritual aspect might indicate underlying factors that could contribute to future criminal behavior.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think there's a reasonable chance he could be at high risk due to his recent substance use and potential underlying issues from his spiritual background.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
