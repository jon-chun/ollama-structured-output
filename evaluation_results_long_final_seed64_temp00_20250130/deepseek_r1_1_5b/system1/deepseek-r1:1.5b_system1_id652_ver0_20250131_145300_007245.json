    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's interesting because being Hispanic can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or mental health issues, but it doesn't inherently make someone a riskier individual. I should consider other factors more than just this.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. This is concerning because an arrest without conviction carries significant weight in criminal justice. It's not just about the person being caught; it's also about their intent and how they handle the situation afterward.\n\nHis height of 6 feet 1 inch and weight between 150 and 174 pounds are within normal ranges for his age, so this doesn't raise any red flags related to physical health or body composition.\n\nHe hasn't been married yet and is living alone. This could be a factor if he's dealing with issues like loneliness or isolation, which might affect his mental health. However, it's not clear how this directly impacts his risk level without more context.\n\nHis education: He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This shows that he's at least somewhat educated and may have some work experience. It doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk unless there are other factors like substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, except for marijuana in the past month. That's a significant issue because marijuana use can lead to serious mental health problems, including addiction, which can be life-threatening if not treated properly. The fact that he has been using it specifically in the past month adds another layer of concern.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some time during the past month he's felt down, which makes him feel so low that nothing could cheer him up. This emotional distress is a clear indicator of mental health issues. It's not just about substance use but also about his ability to cope with negative emotions.\n\nHis background: He lived with both parents in a household of size five in an urban area and considers God has nothing to do with it personally. This could be interpreted as being raised in a certain environment, which might influence mental health if there's neglect or trauma experienced from that upbringing.\n\nPutting this all together, the key risk factors are his recent drug use (marijuana) leading to emotional distress and substance dependence, along with potential issues related to his upbringing. These factors significantly increase the risk of serious consequences, including addiction, mental health problems, and possibly criminal behavior if not addressed properly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
