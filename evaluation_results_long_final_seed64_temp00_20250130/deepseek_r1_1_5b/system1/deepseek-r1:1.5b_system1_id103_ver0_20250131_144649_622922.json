    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. She has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. That's concerning because being in jail for two separate crimes is serious and could lead to legal issues.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 110 lbs. That seems about right for an adult, so no immediate physical risk there. Her height and weight are typical for her age, so that doesn't look high.\n\nShe's never been married and is currently living alone. While being single can be a significant social issue, especially in places where people often marry, it might not inherently pose a legal risk unless she has specific issues like domestic violence or mental health problems.\n\nShe's enrolled in school at the present moment. This could mean she's starting college or taking some classes, which is normal and doesn't indicate high risk on its own. However, if she's struggling academically, that might be a red flag.\n\nHer past behavior includes using drugs\u2014marjuana and cocaine\u2014and has been down in the dumps for four years. That's concerning because drug use can lead to serious health problems, addiction, and legal consequences. The fact that this happened most of the time in the past month adds to the severity.\n\nShe's currently a young adult who lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area. This could be a significant social issue if she has mental health issues or other personal problems. Urban living can sometimes lead to stress, but it doesn't automatically mean high risk unless there are specific concerns about mental health or addiction.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personal issues. While this is interesting and shows a spiritual perspective, it doesn't directly indicate a legal or physical risk. It might be more of an observation than a cause for concern.\n\nPutting all these factors together, the main risks seem to be drug use and possibly mental health issues due to the frequent down time. The person's age, past behavior, and current living situation make her a potential high-risk individual despite some positive aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
