    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might indicate some underlying issues or experiences that could affect his behavior in the future. Being Black can sometimes lead to discrimination, but I'm not sure how that directly affects criminal justice risk assessment.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. Three arrests is a significant number, especially if he's been convicted multiple times. Convictions usually carry serious consequences, so this could be a red flag for someone who might have underlying issues or a history of criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and weight 235 lbs. That seems normal for his age, but I'm not sure how that factors into risk assessment. Maybe it's just a general characteristic, not directly related to criminal behavior.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This is concerning because many people who commit crimes lack education. Lack of education can lead to criminal behavior, so this could be a red flag.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year but hasn't mentioned any changes in his career. This might indicate that he's been in the same role for some time or that he's not seeking advancement. However, without more information on his job performance or any past issues, it's hard to assess risk here.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive factors, but they don't directly indicate criminal behavior. However, they might suggest a person who is stable emotionally, which could be protective of others.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 10, in an urban area. This places him in a potentially vulnerable environment because living with his biological parent can lead to issues like domestic violence or neglect. That's a significant risk factor because it affects the immediate circumstances surrounding his arrest.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is interesting but not directly related to criminal behavior. It might suggest a person who believes in a higher purpose, which could be protective of others' well-being rather than their safety.\n\nPutting all these together: He's young, living in an urban area with his biological mother, has a history of arrest and conviction, lacks education, has lived in the same job for some time, hasn't used drugs or felt depressed. All these factors point towards a high risk because they indicate potential vulnerabilities or underlying issues that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nSo, I think this person is at high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
