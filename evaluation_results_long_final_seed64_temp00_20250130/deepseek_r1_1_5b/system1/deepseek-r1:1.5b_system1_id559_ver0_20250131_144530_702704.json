    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors presented and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a positive sign because it shows he's not from a racial background that might be problematic. He has been arrested three times and convicted, which is concerning. Convictions can indicate past issues or crimes that could affect his current behavior.\n\nHe is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 215 lbs. While weight isn't directly related to criminal risk, it's worth noting. His height might suggest he's active, but again, not a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Single individuals are generally considered less risky in some ways because they don't have the same social support as those who are married or living with partners. However, living alone can still pose risks if there are issues like domestic violence or neglect.\n\nHis weight isn't a significant factor in criminal risk, but it's worth mentioning for context. He has never been married and is single, which might reduce some aspects of his risk profile. He is 6 feet 1 inch, which could suggest he's active physically, but again, not directly related to criminal behavior.\n\nHe weighs 215 lbs, which isn't a major factor in criminal risk. His education level is a high school diploma and hasn't enrolled in college. This shows he has some academic background, which might be seen as less risky than someone without formal education. However, it's not the most significant factor on its own.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year and used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This is a strong indicator of substance abuse. Substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior, especially if it's related to mental health issues or trauma.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal life. While this shows a spiritual aspect, it doesn't directly indicate criminal risk. However, it might suggest he's seeking redemption or meaning in his life, which could be positive.\n\nHe is an 18-year-old, which is generally considered less risky than older individuals because they have more time to develop skills and make decisions without the pressure of age-related issues like accidents or accidents that lead to legal trouble. However, it's not a guarantee of safety.\n\nHe has lived in a household of size seven before. This could indicate he was raised in a family with multiple children, which might provide some social support. But again, this isn't a direct indicator of criminal risk.\n\nHis weight is 215 lbs, which doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior. His height and education level are more about his background than his actions or decisions.\n\nHe has never been married and is single, living alone, with no children, and has a high school diploma. These factors show he's relatively independent but might face challenges from living alone, domestic violence, neglect, etc.\n\nHis substance abuse history (marijuana for four years) and the emotional down period during the past month are strong indicators of potential criminal behavior. Substance abuse can lead to delinquency or criminal activities if not managed properly.\n\nHis spiritual aspect is interesting but doesn't directly indicate criminal risk. It might suggest he's seeking meaning, which could be positive or negative depending on context.\n\nOverall, while there are several factors that could contribute to criminal risk, the person has a history of substance abuse and has experienced emotional down periods, which are strong indicators of potential criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
