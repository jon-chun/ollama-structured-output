    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. So, there's some uncertainty about the outcome of his arrest. However, if he's ever convicted in the future, that could be a risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. That seems reasonable for an 18-year-old, but I'm not sure how this affects his risk. Maybe height isn't a big issue here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That might indicate some stress or strain on his family life, which could be a concern if he's dealing with issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nHe has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. This shows that he's educated but hasn't pursued higher education. If he's not attending school, it might affect his ability to handle the stress of being an adult without further education, especially if he's dealing with substance use and mental health issues.\n\nHe's 21 years old now? Wait, no, he's 18. So, he hasn't had a chance to start college yet. That could be a significant risk because he might not have the necessary skills or knowledge to handle the responsibilities of higher education, especially if he's dealing with substance use and mental health issues.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year but isn't currently employed. This shows that he's actively looking for work, which is good. However, if he's struggling financially or in his job, it could be a risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That seems concerning because substance abuse can lead to serious mental health issues, including depression. If he's still feeling depressed despite using drugs, that might indicate underlying stress or anxiety from substance use.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in an urban household of size six. This is unusual for an 18-year-old because typically, a parent would be the primary caregiver. Living with two parents could lead to issues like domestic abuse or neglect, which might affect his mental health and well-being.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This seems more philosophical and less concrete. While it's interesting, I'm not sure how directly it affects his risk factors for substance use or mental health.\n\nPutting this all together, the main concerns are substance abuse (marijuana) and depression. The person is 18, hasn't had a chance to start college yet, which could be significant if he struggles financially or in his job. His living situation with two parents might also pose risks related to domestic issues. However, these factors seem more about the circumstances of his life rather than his behavior.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if all these factors are directly linked to substance use and mental health, but they do present some concerns that could indicate a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
