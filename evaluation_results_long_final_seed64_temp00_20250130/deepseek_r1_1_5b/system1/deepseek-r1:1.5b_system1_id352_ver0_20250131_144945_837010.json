That doesn't immediately strike me as a high risk factor, but it's something to consider. He's been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning because criminal activity can be serious. His height of 6 feet 3 inches and weight of 190 lbs are within normal ranges for his age.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone, which might indicate some stress or uncertainty about family life. The household size being four means he has a small group, but that doesn't seem too problematic. He has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college, so education-wise, he's on track for graduation.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the last month. That's good because substance abuse can lead to serious issues like addiction or mental health problems. His living situation with adults other than biological parents in an urban area is a bit unusual but not something I associate with high risk factors.\n\nThe fact that he considers God has nothing to do with his personal life might be seen as a lack of self-awareness, which could lead to more serious issues later on. However, it's still within normal boundaries for someone at this age.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some red flags like past convictions and living alone, the person seems to have made some progress with his education and has a stable routine. The lack of substance abuse and depression is positive. So overall, I think he's in a safer position than high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
