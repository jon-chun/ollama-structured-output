    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's interesting because being Hispanic can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or mental health issues, but I'm not sure how significant that is at his age. He has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That's concerning because it means he might have some underlying issues that aren't resolved yet.\n\nHe's 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 280 lbs. That seems about right for a 19-year-old, so not an issue there. His height is average, which usually correlates with better physical health, but I'm not sure how that plays into mental health risk factors.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marital issues can sometimes lead to stress or emotional problems, especially if one partner has a history of mental illness or substance abuse. But again, it's not clear if this is a high-risk factor here.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That's a significant lack of education, which can lead to various health issues, including mental health problems. However, at his age, especially being 19, the impact might be less severe compared to someone with a higher level of education.\n\nHe has held 5 jobs during the year and hasn't used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) or felt depressed over the past month. That's concerning because substance abuse can lead to serious mental health issues like depression or anxiety, which are high-risk factors. Also, feeling depressed is a clear indicator of potential mental health problems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. This could mean that he has some family history of mental health issues, but I'm not sure how significant that is at this stage. Living in an urban area might also affect his environment and access to resources for mental health.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. That's a strong statement because it suggests that he believes in a personal connection to God, which could be a positive trait. However, if he doesn't have any underlying issues or is struggling with them, this might not directly indicate high risk factors.\n\nPutting all these together: He has some underlying issues like substance abuse and depression, which are high-risk factors. His lack of education and living in an urban area might contribute to his mental health challenges but aren't necessarily the most severe ones. The fact that he's married and living with a spouse could also introduce stress or emotional strain, though it's not clear if that's a high risk factor.\n\nI think the overall assessment leans towards high risk because of substance abuse and depression, which are serious mental health issues. However, I'm still uncertain about the other factors like education level and living situation as they might have some impact but aren't the most severe.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
