    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. So, there's some uncertainty about the outcome of his arrest. I should note that.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 170 lbs. That seems normal for an 18-year-old, so no immediate risk factors here. His family situation: he's lived with his biological dad in a household of size five in an urban area. That might be concerning because living with a parent can lead to issues like domestic violence or neglect. I should flag that as a potential risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently single, which doesn't directly indicate a risk but could affect relationships if he gets involved later on. His education: he has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. That shows some academic capability, but it might not be enough to bypass criminal charges. I should mention that.\n\nHe's had one job during the year, which is typical for an 18-year-old. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are more about substance use and mental health, respectively. While he hasn't engaged in drug abuse or shown signs of depression, it's something to consider.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in an urban area. That's concerning because living with a parent can lead to issues like domestic violence, neglect, or abuse. I should note that as a potential risk factor.\n\nHis beliefs: he considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This is unusual and could indicate a lack of self-awareness or a belief in an overly simplistic worldview. It might raise concerns about his mental health or behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risks seem to be living with his biological father in an urban area, possibly engaging in domestic violence, and having a family situation that's concerning. The arrest history is somewhat low, but the other factors add up to potential high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
