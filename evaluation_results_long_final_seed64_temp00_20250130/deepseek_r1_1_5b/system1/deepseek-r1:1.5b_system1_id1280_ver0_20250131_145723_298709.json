    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might indicate some underlying issues or cultural background that could affect judgment. But at 22, he's still developing his skills and experiences, so maybe this isn't a major risk yet.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's concerning because criminal charges can lead to serious consequences. However, if the arrest was minor or related to something manageable, it might not be a high-risk indicator.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and weight 218 lbs. These are average measurements for his age, so there's no immediate red flag here. It's more about overall health than physical condition.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 218 lbs\u2014again, these are typical adult heights and weights. There's no indication of malnutrition or other health issues that would make him a high-risk individual.\n\nHis age is 22, which isn't too old for criminal charges, but it does mean he might be developing some skills or experiences over time. However, at this stage, it's still unclear if this will lead to serious consequences.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. This could affect his relationships and social interactions, but without more specific issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, it doesn't seem high risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. While education can be a factor, especially if he hasn't completed higher levels, this alone isn't enough to determine a high-risk status unless there are other underlying factors.\n\nHe's 21 years old, which is still within the age range for criminal charges, but it doesn't necessarily mean he will commit a serious crime. The risk level depends more on specific circumstances than age alone.\n\nHe has held two jobs and used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and during the past month, he felt down and didn't feel motivated to cheer up. This is concerning because substance use can lead to severe health issues or addiction problems. However, it's not a high-risk indicator unless combined with other serious factors like mental health issues.\n\nThe person lived with his biological mother in an 8-person household when he was 22. While this might have been a manageable situation, living alone is still concerning and could affect his ability to make decisions or interact socially.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are signs of substance use and possibly some stress from living alone, the overall risk isn't high enough to categorize him as a \"YES\" risk. The factors are more about potential issues than outright high-risk indicators.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
