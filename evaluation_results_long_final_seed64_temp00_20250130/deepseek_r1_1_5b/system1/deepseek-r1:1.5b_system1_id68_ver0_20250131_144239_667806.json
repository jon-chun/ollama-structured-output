Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to note. She has been arrested once and convicted, which is concerning because that could lead to serious legal issues. The fact that she's never been married and living alone might indicate financial instability or other personal challenges.\n\nHer height of 5 feet 5 inches and weight of 130 lbs are within normal ranges for her age, so that doesn't raise any red flags. She has a high school diploma but lacks a GED certificate, which is unusual. She's not enrolled in college either, which could mean she's working or hasn't pursued further education beyond the high school level.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs during the year and has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some time in the past month felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This drug use is concerning, especially if it's recent or related to her current situation of living alone. The down feeling might indicate stress or anxiety, which can be dangerous.\n\nShe also considers God has nothing to do with her personal life, which is unusual and raises questions about her beliefs. However, that doesn't necessarily mean she's a danger; it could just mean she's not open to discussing her faith.\n\nPutting this all together, the arrest history, drug use, and feelings of downness are significant risk factors. The lack of education and job stability might contribute to legal issues, but without more context on how these factors have led to the current situation, I can't be certain. However, given the immediate concerns about her past actions and the potential for legal consequences, it seems high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
