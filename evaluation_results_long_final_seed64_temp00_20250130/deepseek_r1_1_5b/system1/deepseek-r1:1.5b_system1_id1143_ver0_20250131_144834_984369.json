    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. That's interesting because being Hispanic can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors or mental health issues, but I'm not sure how significant that is on its own. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's a bit concerning because it means he might have some underlying issues that could lead to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. That seems about right for his age, so no immediate health concerns there. His height is typical for a 21-year-old, so I don't think this is an issue. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might indicate some level of education, but it's not the highest. He's not enrolled in college either, so he might be at risk if he has certain issues.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. That could mean he's dealing with feelings of loneliness or maybe facing a lot of stress from his current situation. Living alone can sometimes lead to mental health problems because there are fewer people around him to share experiences with, which might contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could indicate that he's at risk if he has certain learning disabilities or other issues that make it harder for him to succeed academically. If he can't keep up with his studies, it might lead to problems both in school and later in life.\n\nHe has held 1 job during the year but hasn't mentioned what it was. That's a bit vague, so I don't know if this affects his risk factors. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious mental health issues like addiction or anxiety. Feeling depressed might also contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, which is typical for a 21-year-old. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This seems more about personal beliefs and doesn't directly indicate any risk factors related to criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the person has some underlying issues like being Hispanic, possibly drug use, living alone, not having a high school diploma, living in an urban area, and feeling depressed. These factors could contribute to criminal behavior or increase the likelihood of being arrested. However, since he hasn't been convicted yet, there's still some uncertainty about whether these issues will lead to criminal activity.\n\nI think it's a high risk because while he has some negative aspects, especially with his drug use and living alone, which are serious concerns, he hasn't shown signs that would indicate criminal behavior. But the combination of these factors makes him at higher risk than someone without any significant issues.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
