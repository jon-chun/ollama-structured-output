    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning because it shows he's facing serious legal issues. His age being young might also raise some concerns about mental health or substance abuse.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 190 lbs. That's a reasonable weight for his height, so not an issue here. He's never been married and is living alone, which could be a sign of stress or financial strain if he's dealing with substance use. His lack of a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests potential academic challenges, especially since he's young.\n\nHe has held one job during the year but hasn't mentioned it yet. This might indicate that his career is uncertain or that he's balancing work with personal issues like substance abuse. He's used marijuana in the past four years, which is a clear sign of substance use disorder. Additionally, he's had some emotional distress, feeling down and unable to recover, especially during the past month.\n\nHe's from an urban household of size six, which might mean he has access to resources or social support that could be beneficial if he were to change his circumstances. However, living alone in a small community can be challenging without any support systems. His identification as White doesn't directly relate to substance use but is part of his background.\n\nPutting this all together, the individual has significant substance abuse history, past convictions, and emotional distress. These factors are strong indicators of high risk because they show he's facing serious legal consequences and personal challenges that could affect his ability to live independently or pursue further education.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
