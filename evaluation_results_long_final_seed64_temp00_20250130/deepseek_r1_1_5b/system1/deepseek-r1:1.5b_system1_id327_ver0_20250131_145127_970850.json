    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's 18 years old, which is a significant age in many jurisdictions. However, since it's her first arrest, that might be a red flag. She identifies as Black, which could raise concerns about race, especially if there are systemic issues related to that identity. But I'm not sure how impactful that is yet.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's concerning because it means she's facing legal consequences without any positive outcomes. The lack of conviction might indicate a history of similar issues or past crimes that could be linked to her current behavior.\n\nHer height and weight are within the normal range for an 18-year-old, so that doesn't seem high risk. She hasn't been married yet, which is fine, but if she's single in the future, that might affect her relationships and potential legal issues related to that.\n\nShe's not a high school graduate or GED, which could mean she lacks some foundational skills needed for certain jobs or legal work. However, without specific evidence of those skills being lacking, it's hard to say. But it does add another layer of risk because many law enforcement agencies require basic education.\n\nShe hasn't enrolled in college, which might indicate a lack of motivation or interest in pursuing higher education. This could lead to issues down the line if she doesn't get the necessary qualifications for her career or legal work.\n\nHer job history shows she's had 4 jobs during the year and has never been married. That suggests she's employed consistently without any significant changes, which is a positive sign. However, if she's had past issues with her job that led to arrests, that could be a red flag.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years and has dealt with some emotional distress, particularly feeling down in the dumps during the past month. This emotional state might indicate underlying mental health issues or stress-related problems. It's important to consider if this is related to her current arrest history or if it's isolated.\n\nLiving in an urban household of size 10 and considering that God has something to do with her personal life could raise concerns about cultural or religious influences affecting her behavior. This might be a red flag, especially if she's dealing with issues like substance abuse or emotional distress.\n\nShe considers living with both biological parents in a young age, which is unusual but not necessarily a high risk unless it indicates a history of similar issues. However, since she's only 18, that's more recent than her past behavior.\n\nOverall, the factors include potential racial identity concerns, legal consequences without positive outcomes, lack of education and college completion, job history with possible negative impacts, emotional distress related to substance abuse and living alone, and cultural or religious influences. These all add up to a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
