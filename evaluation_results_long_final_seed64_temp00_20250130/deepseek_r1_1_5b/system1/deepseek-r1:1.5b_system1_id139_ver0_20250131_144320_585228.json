    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might raise some concerns about race and identity issues. But I'm not sure how significant that is on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's concerning because it means she could face legal consequences, which can be risky in itself. However, if the arrest was due to a serious crime like murder or rape, maybe it's less severe. But since it's just an arrest without conviction, I think that's a red flag.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 134 lbs. That seems normal for her age, so no immediate risk there.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. That could be risky because living with someone who might be a family member or in a relationship can lead to issues like domestic violence or emotional problems. But since she's single, maybe that's less of an issue unless it's related to her past behavior.\n\nHer height and weight are within normal ranges, so no major health risks here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. That might indicate she hasn't attended school recently, which could be risky if she's not prepared for the workforce or if there's a gap in education. But it's possible that she's working part-time or has some experience.\n\nShe's not currently enrolled in college and has held two jobs during the year. This shows she's actively looking for work but hasn't yet, which could be risky because it might lead to unemployment or low income if she doesn't find a stable job.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has been feeling down recently\u2014so much so that nothing could cheer her up. This is concerning because drug use can have serious health implications, including addiction, which can be dangerous. The recent downpour adds to the stress and potential for harm.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. That's a bit unusual but not necessarily high risk unless it leads to family issues or neglect. However, living alone is still risky because it can lead to emotional problems, isolation, and potential domestic violence if someone is involved.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personally. This could be interpreted as seeking divine guidance or purpose, which might be seen as positive but not necessarily high risk unless there's a lack of spiritual growth or faith issues.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risks seem to be the recent downpour related to drug use and living alone, along with possibly some concerns about her past behavior. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe that's less severe than if she had. But overall, these factors do indicate a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
