    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 21 years old, which is a significant age in criminal justice. That might raise concerns about his ability to handle the risks involved. But I'm not sure yet; maybe he can manage it.\n\nHe identifies as Black and has been arrested multiple times. This could indicate some underlying issues related to race or identity, but again, I'm not certain if that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs over 195 lbs. That's quite a build for his age, which might be concerning in terms of physical health. However, he hasn't been diagnosed with any serious health issues yet, so maybe it's manageable.\n\nHis weight is about 74 kg, which seems normal. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. That could put him at risk because many people with this background face criminal charges. I think that's a red flag for high risk.\n\nHe's lived alone in a rural area with seven family members. This might be risky if he has substance abuse issues, especially since he used marijuana in the past four years and is feeling down recently. He hasn't been diagnosed with any serious conditions yet, but it could lead to complications.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal struggles. That's interesting because it suggests a spiritual component to his behavior. However, I'm not sure how significant that is in terms of risk assessment without more information.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors about age, weight, lack of education, living alone, substance abuse history, and spiritual beliefs are all concerning. The lack of medical diagnosis, especially regarding mental health or physical conditions, adds to the risk. However, I'm not entirely sure if these factors collectively indicate a high risk without more context.\n\nI think it's worth considering this as a high risk because there are multiple concerns: age-related issues, substance abuse history, living alone in risky situations, lack of education, and spiritual beliefs that could lead to criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 7, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
