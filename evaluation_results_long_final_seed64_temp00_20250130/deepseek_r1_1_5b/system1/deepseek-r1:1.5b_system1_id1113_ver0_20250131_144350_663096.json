    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because it might suggest some underlying issues or cultural background that could be problematic. But I'm not sure how significant this is yet.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. That's a lot of criminal history. It's a red flag for high risk, but I should consider the context. If he's been in a system where he's had similar issues before, maybe it's more concerning than just three convictions.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and weight 195 lbs. That seems normal for his age, so no immediate health risks here.\n\nHe weighs 195 lbs, which is within the average range for a 22-year-old male. So that doesn't indicate high risk.\n\nHis weight isn't an issue, but it's good to know he's not underweight or overweight.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and 20 inches wide, so his height is quite normal. His weight is also within the average range for his age.\n\nHe's 195 lbs, which is a bit on the lower side for his height but still within the healthy weight range. So no high risk from that aspect.\n\nHis weight isn't an issue, and he's not underweight or overweight, so that doesn't contribute to high risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That could be concerning because being single might lead to issues like domestic violence, which can affect mental health. But I'm not sure how significant this is yet.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall with a household of five people. That seems normal, but maybe in an urban area, it could have some implications for his environment or relationships.\n\nHe's a high school graduate and enrolled in a four-year college. That suggests he might be pursuing further education, which could lead to higher risks if he's not managing his studies well.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. This shows he's employed but may have inconsistent work hours or a gap between jobs. It's something to watch for potential burnout or stress from multiple jobs.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, and some of the time during the past month he felt down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious mental health issues like anxiety, depression, and addiction. The emotional impact from feeling down is a significant risk factor.\n\nHis age being 22 might also indicate potential stress or burnout if he's not managing his responsibilities well. However, it's more about the overall lifestyle than specific risks unless there are other factors.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal issues. This could be a positive sign if he's seeking spiritual guidance and is taking steps to address his problems. But it doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless combined with other negative factors.\n\nPutting all this together, the main concerns seem to be his drug use history, emotional downtimes, and possibly his weight or height being outside of normal ranges. However, his weight isn't an issue, so that's not a concern. His height is also within normal range. The drug use is a clear high risk factor because it leads to serious mental health problems.\n\nSo, based on the factors provided, I would predict a high risk for this individual.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
