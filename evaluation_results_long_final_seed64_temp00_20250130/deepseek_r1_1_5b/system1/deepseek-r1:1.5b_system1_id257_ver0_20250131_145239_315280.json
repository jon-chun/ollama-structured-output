    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as mixed race. Mixed-race individuals can face challenges in social interactions, which might affect their ability to form relationships or contribute to society. That could be a red flag for potential risks like domestic violence or mental health issues.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. While arrest is concerning, it's not enough on its own unless there are additional factors that indicate a higher risk of re-arrest or conviction. For example, if she's facing serious charges or if the circumstances of her arrest (like lack of legal representation) could lead to more severe consequences.\n\nShe's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. That seems normal for an 18-year-old, so physical health isn't a major concern here. However, body type might indicate potential issues with weight management or body image problems, which could be related to mental health or social challenges.\n\nHer height is within the average range, but combined with her weight and mixed race background, it might suggest she's in a vulnerable area. Mixed-race individuals often face discrimination, which could lead to negative outcomes like discrimination in employment, housing, or higher rates of substance abuse.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. This is concerning because being single can lead to issues related to family dynamics, financial stability, and social support. Single individuals might be more prone to domestic violence, substance abuse, or mental health struggles.\n\nShe's enrolled in school at the present moment. This suggests she has some level of independence and possibly a good sense of responsibility. However, if she's not attending school properly, it could lead to academic issues, which might affect her ability to contribute to society.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year but hasn't been consistent with them. This inconsistency can be concerning because it might indicate poor time management or lack of stability in her career. If one job is significantly more demanding than the other, it could lead to burnout or stress, which are serious risks.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and has experienced significant emotional downfalls (down in the dumps) at least once in the past month. This is a strong indicator of substance abuse. Even though she hasn't been convicted yet, the history of drug use could lead to criminal charges or long-term health issues related to addiction.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personal life. While this might suggest a spiritual aspect, it doesn't directly indicate a risk level unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or mental health issues. However, the mention of God's influence could be a red flag for potential stress or emotional challenges.\n\nPutting all these together, several factors point towards high risk:\n- Mixed-race background and potential social issues\n- Single status and family dynamics\n- Lack of consistent job performance\n- History of substance abuse\n- Possible spiritual or emotional challenges\n\nTherefore, the prediction is YES with a confidence level of 85%.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
