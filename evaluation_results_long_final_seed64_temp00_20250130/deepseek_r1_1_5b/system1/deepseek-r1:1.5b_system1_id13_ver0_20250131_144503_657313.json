    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male from Asia-Pacific, arrested once, convicted. That's not too bad; criminal records are common for young people. He's 5'10\" and 145 lbs, which seems about right for his age. No previous marriages, living alone now\u2014so no family issues to worry about.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college, so he's educated but hasn't started working yet. That could be an issue if he starts looking for work soon. He's enrolled in a 4-year college, which might take time, but it's not immediately concerning.\n\nHe's never been married, living alone now\u2014so no family problems. The household size is 4, which isn't too big. He has a high school diploma and is in college, so he's on track for graduation soon. No prior jobs during the year, so his career path is clear.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't been caught yet. That's concerning because marijuana use can lead to addiction or other health issues. The person has also felt down a lot recently\u2014so maybe stress from recent events? But he's still living alone and doesn't mention any family problems, so that might be manageable.\n\nHe considers God nothing to do with his life personally. This could indicate a lack of personal accountability or a belief in external factors over his actions. It might lead to self-doubt or fear of judgment from others.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, has criminal history, is single, no family issues, but he's using marijuana and feels down. His religious beliefs might add another layer of concern if they're seen as unfounded. However, his lack of previous jobs could be a positive sign. It seems like the person isn't in immediate danger, but there are some red flags about his personal beliefs and possibly his drug use.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
