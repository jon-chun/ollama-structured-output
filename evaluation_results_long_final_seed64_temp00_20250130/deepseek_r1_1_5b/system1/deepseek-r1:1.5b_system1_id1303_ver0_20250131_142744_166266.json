    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's a significant racial background, which might raise concerns about identity theft or other forms of identity fraud. I should note that.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's serious, but it doesn't necessarily mean high risk unless there are additional factors like intent to commit crimes or intent to harm others. Since the user didn't mention anything about intent, maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis height of 5 feet 8 inches and weight between 200 and 224 pounds are within normal ranges for his age, so that doesn't indicate high risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. While living alone can be risky, especially if he has substance abuse history or other issues, this is a low risk factor because it's not mentioned in detail.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could indicate potential for higher education risks, but again, without specific details on his academic background or any related risks, it's probably low.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs during the year. Job history can be an indicator of stability and reliability, which are positive factors. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This seems like a mix of substance abuse and mental health issues. Both can indicate potential for higher risks, but without more context on how these combine or if there's any intent to commit crimes, it might be low risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. This places him in a potentially vulnerable community, especially if the community has higher rates of crime or substance abuse issues. That could indicate high risk factors.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is interesting because it suggests a spiritual connection, which might be seen as positive but doesn't inherently raise high risk concerns unless combined with other factors like substance use or mental health.\n\nPutting this all together, the main high-risk indicators seem to be living in an urban area with potentially higher crime rates and possibly higher rates of substance abuse. The racial background is a concern, but without more specific details on intent or intent to harm others, it's low risk. The job history and substance use are mixed factors that could contribute but aren't strong enough alone.\n\nSo, overall, the person has some high-risk elements due to living in an urban area and possibly substance abuse, while other factors like race and mental health may be low risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
