    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's a significant racial background, which might raise concerns about potential biases or issues related to race in law enforcement or criminal justice. I should note that this could be a red flag for potential bias or systemic issues.\n\nNext, he has been arrested four times and is convicted. Four arrests are quite high; it's unusual for someone of his age to go through multiple arrests without some underlying issue. This might indicate past problems that need attention.\n\nHe is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 155 lbs. That's a healthy weight, which is positive but not necessarily indicative of risk factors related to height or weight in this context.\n\nHis current status as an adult means he hasn't been married yet, which could be concerning if it affects his relationships with law enforcement or other professionals. However, since he's 18, that might be a minor concern compared to older individuals who often face more stress from marriage and parenthood.\n\nHe is currently enrolled in school at the present moment. This shows he's actively seeking education, which is good for learning skills related to criminal justice. But if he's not attending school or has significant gaps, it could indicate potential issues with his ability to learn or handle the demands of law enforcement.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone can be a challenge in many settings, especially when dealing with criminal justice work where social interactions are important. This might lead to stress or isolation, which could be a risk factor if it affects his mental health or ability to perform tasks effectively.\n\nHe is enrolled in school but has not used any drugs in the past four years and some time during the past month he felt down. Using drugs is a serious issue that can affect both mental health and criminal behavior. The recent down feeling could indicate underlying stress or anxiety, which might contribute to his risk of using substances.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of size seven in a rural area. This background could have implications for family dynamics, especially if it affects how he interacts with law enforcement and other professionals. It's important to consider the potential impact on relationships and mental health.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life. This is concerning because it suggests a belief in divine intervention or guidance, which might indicate issues related to faith-based beliefs affecting criminal behavior. It could also imply a lack of self-awareness regarding how his faith influences his actions.\n\nPutting all these factors together, the person's racial background, past arrests, living alone, and recent down feelings are significant red flags. They raise concerns about potential biases, underlying issues that may need attention, and stress-related behaviors. These factors collectively indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
