Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a high-risk indicator, but it's important to consider her background and how that might affect her behavior or decisions.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. This is concerning because being in jail can lead to serious mental health issues. The fact that she's never been married suggests she may have had some single experiences, which could be a risk factor for substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHer height and weight are within normal ranges, so physical health isn't an issue here. She has a high school diploma but hasn't attended college, which might indicate she hasn't developed any academic skills yet. This could lead to problems in higher education or career planning.\n\nShe's lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 for five years and is currently living alone. This significant change from family living may have strained relationships and could affect mental health. The fact that she considers God has something to do with her personal life adds another layer, possibly indicating a lack of control or understanding.\n\nShe's never used drugs in the past four years but hasn't been using them recently either. This suggests she might be struggling with substance use, which is a serious concern. Most of the time during the past month, she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This emotional distress is a clear red flag for mental health risks.\n\nShe's currently living alone and has a high school diploma but hasn't attended college. This lack of formal education might lead to issues in higher education or career planning, which could be risky if she doesn't address them early on.\n\nOverall, the combination of past experiences with substance use, emotional distress, and possibly lack of academic progress makes her at risk for mental health complications.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
