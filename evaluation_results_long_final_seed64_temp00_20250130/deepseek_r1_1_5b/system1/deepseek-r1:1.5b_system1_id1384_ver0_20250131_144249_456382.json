    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female from American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut descent. That's significant because it can affect her legal status in some areas. She has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. This is concerning because it shows potential criminal behavior without immediate conviction. I'll mark this as YES with a confidence of 85%.\n\nNext, she's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That's within the healthy weight range for her age, so no immediate risk from physical health issues. Still, it's worth noting that her background might influence legal outcomes.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marital status can affect criminal behavior because sometimes couples have a history of criminal activities. However, without specific information on their past actions or relationships, this is moderate. I'll assign YES with 75%.\n\nHer education level: She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could indicate potential criminal behavior if she's not studying to avoid issues. So, another YES with 60%.\n\nShe has held one job during the year but hasn't mentioned it. Job history can sometimes be misleading, especially if they're not in a high-paying field or if they've been inactive for some time. This is moderate risk, so YES with 55%.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has had significant emotional down moments. This shows a clear pattern of substance abuse, which can indicate criminal behavior. I'll mark this as YES with 80%.\n\nShe's from a rural area where she lived with her biological mother in a household of size three. This could mean she might have less support or resources at home, potentially affecting her legal status. However, it's not an absolute risk factor. So, YES with 70%.\n\nGod's influence: She considers God to have something to do with her personal life. While this is interesting, it doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior. It might be a red herring or unrelated. I'll mark this as NO.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors are mostly positive but include some that could indicate risk. The arrest history and drug use are strong indicators of potential criminal behavior. The rural background and lack of education might also play into her legal status. However, without more context on her criminal history or specific actions, it's a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70%\n}",
