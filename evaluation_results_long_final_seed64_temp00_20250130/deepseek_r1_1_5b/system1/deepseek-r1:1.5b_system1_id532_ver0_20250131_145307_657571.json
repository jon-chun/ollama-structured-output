Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 18 and male, which is a clear indicator of potential criminal behavior. They've been arrested six times, which is quite high. That's a strong sign of a serious issue that could lead to legal consequences.\n\nNext, they're white, but I don't have any specific information about racial risk factors here. So maybe that doesn't add much unless there are known statistics on race in criminal justice systems.\n\nThey're 5 feet 9 inches and weigh between 175 and 199 pounds. That's a healthy weight range for their height, so no immediate health issues related to weight or body composition.\n\nTheir lifestyle is quite active\u2014they've held one job during the year and are currently enrolled in school. This suggests they're managing their time effectively, which could be beneficial but doesn't necessarily indicate criminal behavior unless there are other factors at play.\n\nThey've never been married and live alone now. Single individuals might have different behaviors compared to those who are married or living with a partner. But without specific data on single individuals in this context, it's hard to assess risk here.\n\nThey've used drugs\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and haven't felt depressed over the past month. Using substances can lead to criminal behavior, especially if there's a history of substance abuse. The lack of depression doesn't directly indicate criminal activity but could be a factor in their decision-making or behavior patterns.\n\nLiving in an urban area with a household of six\u2014this might mean they have access to certain resources or opportunities that could contribute to criminal activities. However, it's not a definitive indicator without more context on their environment and circumstances.\n\nOverall, the high number of arrests, recent drug use, and lack of depression are significant factors pointing towards potential criminal behavior. The other details don't add enough weight to suggest a high risk unless there are specific known statistics or patterns that I'm missing.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
