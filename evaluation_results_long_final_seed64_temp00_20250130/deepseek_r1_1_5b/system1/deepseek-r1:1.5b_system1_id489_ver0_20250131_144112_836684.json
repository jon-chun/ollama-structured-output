    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. She has been arrested three times without conviction, which is concerning because that means she might be facing multiple convictions in the future. However, I don't have specific details about each arrest, so I can't say for sure if they're related or not.\n\nShe's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 110 lbs. That seems normal for a 22-year-old, but again, without more context, it's hard to tell if this is an indicator of higher risk.\n\nShe's separated and currently not living alone. Separation can be a red flag because it might indicate financial instability or other issues that could lead to legal problems. However, the fact that she hasn't been convicted yet doesn't necessarily mean she'll face legal issues in the future.\n\nHer height is 5'5\", which is within typical ranges for her age and gender. Her weight of 110 lbs also seems reasonable. She has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college, which might indicate that she's not pursuing higher education, possibly due to financial constraints or other reasons. However, this doesn't directly relate to legal risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, except during the last month when she felt so down in the dumps. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious health issues and legal consequences. The fact that most of her time has been during this period adds to the concern about potential legal issues.\n\nShe's considered that God has something to do with her personal struggles, which might indicate a lack of faith or a belief in an external force affecting her life. However, this doesn't necessarily translate into higher risk factors for criminal justice assessment unless it suggests a deeper psychological or spiritual issue that could lead to legal problems.\n\nOverall, while there are some red flags like past drug use and the separation from her household, without more specific information about each factor, it's challenging to determine if these indicate high risk. However, given the context of being arrested three times without conviction and having used drugs in the past four years, I would lean towards a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
