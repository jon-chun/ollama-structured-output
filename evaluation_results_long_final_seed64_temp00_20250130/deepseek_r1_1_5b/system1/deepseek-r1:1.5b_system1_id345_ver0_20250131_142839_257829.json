    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a high risk factor, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested once and convicted, which is concerning because criminal activity can have serious consequences.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 128 lbs. That seems about right for his age, so not an issue here. His family situation: he's lived with both biological parents in a rural household of size four. I know that living with parents can be stressful, especially if they're involved in criminal activities or have other issues. But since it's rural and he's 20, maybe it's manageable.\n\nHe's never married and is currently single. That might affect his relationships, but again, not a high risk factor unless there are specific circumstances that could lead to serious consequences.\n\nHis education: he has a high school diploma and isn't in college. That's below the minimum for many jobs, especially in criminal justice or law enforcement. It might limit his career opportunities if he wants to work in those fields.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs during the year. If he's not in a stable job, that could lead to issues with his schedule and relationships. But without knowing his specific circumstances, it's hard to say if this is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years. That's concerning because drug use can have serious health implications, including addiction. It might affect his mental health as well.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mood changes are normal, feeling completely unwell or depressed could be a red flag for something more serious, like abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHis background: He considers God to have something to do with his personal life. This is interesting because it suggests he's seeking meaning and purpose in his life. However, if this relates to criminal behavior, it might indicate a deeper issue that needs addressing.\n\nPutting all these together, while some factors like drug use and mental health issues are concerning, the overall picture isn't extremely high risk unless there are specific circumstances that could lead to serious consequences. Without more context on how his life is affecting him or any other significant issues, I think it's a reasonable assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
