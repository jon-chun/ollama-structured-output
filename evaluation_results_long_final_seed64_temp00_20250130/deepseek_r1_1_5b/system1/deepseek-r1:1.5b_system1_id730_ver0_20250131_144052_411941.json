    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. So, there's some uncertainty about the outcome of his arrest. I should note that this is possible.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 160 lbs. That seems reasonable for a 21-year-old. His height is typical for males in his age group, so no immediate concern here.\n\nHis marital status is never married, and he's currently living alone. This could be concerning if it affects his relationships or mental health. But since he hasn't been married, that might not directly impact his risk factors as much unless there are underlying issues related to living alone.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. That means he may have some work experience or skills outside of education. This could be relevant if it affects his ability to handle the arrest or if it's linked to other issues like substance abuse or depression.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive signs, but I should consider if they're enough on their own. If he's been feeling depressed for a while, that could indicate underlying stress or anxiety related to his arrest.\n\nAt 21, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size five in a rural area. This is unusual because typically, a 21-year-old would have lived with their parents as children. Living alone in a small community might be challenging and could affect mental health if there are issues like substance abuse or depression.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal life. This seems more abstract but could indicate a spiritual or religious background, which is positive unless it's linked to other negative factors.\n\nPutting this all together, the main concerns seem to be his arrest history, living alone in a small community, and any potential underlying issues related to substance abuse or depression. However, since he hasn't used drugs or felt depressed recently, these might not be severe enough on their own. But combined with living alone and possibly other negative factors, it could add up.\n\nI think the overall risk is high because there are multiple areas that could contribute to his potential issues. The arrest history, living situation, and possible underlying health problems all point towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
