    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual based on the provided JSON structure and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag, but it's something to note. She has been arrested three times and convicted, which is concerning because that could lead to serious legal issues. The fact that she's married and living with her spouse adds another layer of complexity; being in a relationship might affect her mental health.\n\nHer height (5'5\") and weight (150-174 lbs) are within normal ranges for her age, so that doesn't raise any red flags. She has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, which could mean she's working or hasn't attended school beyond high school. However, this alone might not be a risk factor unless it affects her ability to work or access education.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse, so being in a relationship could lead to issues like domestic abuse or substance abuse problems. The mention of using marijuana in the past four years is concerning because marijuana use can have serious health implications, especially if done at such a young age. She also used some of that drug during the past month, which adds another layer of concern.\n\nShe's been married for how long? The JSON doesn't specify, but being in a relationship could mean she's dealing with issues like substance abuse or domestic violence. Additionally, she has held one job during the year and hasn't been out of work for more than a few months, which might indicate she's not looking for another job quickly.\n\nShe's considered living with adults other than biological parents in a household of six. This could mean she's dealing with issues related to her upbringing or being raised by others, which might affect her mental health and ability to handle legal situations. She also mentions that God has something to do with her personal life, which is interesting but not necessarily a risk factor unless it implies a lack of faith in her behavior.\n\nPutting this all together, the significant concerns are her past drug use history, particularly marijuana, which could be dangerous. Her being married and living with others might lead to issues like domestic abuse or substance abuse problems. The mention of substance abuse during the past month adds another concern. Additionally, she's been married for a certain period, which could indicate she's dealing with family dynamics that might affect her ability to handle legal situations.\n\nTherefore, I would classify this as high risk because there are multiple significant concerns related to her drug use history, her marital status, and potential issues in her relationship.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
