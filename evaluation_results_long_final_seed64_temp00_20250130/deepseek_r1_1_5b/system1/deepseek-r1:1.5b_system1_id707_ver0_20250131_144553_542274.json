    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested three times and convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a high risk factor because it's just his age and race. But I should consider other aspects too.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and is currently convicted. Three arrests in four years seem like a lot. It might indicate some underlying issues, but it could also be due to luck or misunderstanding. I'm not sure yet if that's high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches and weight 145 lbs. That seems normal for an 18-year-old. Maybe he's in the average range, so this doesn't look like a high risk factor.\n\nHe weighs 145 lbs, which is within the typical range for his age. So I don't think this is a high risk indicator.\n\nHis weight isn't a major concern here. It's more about overall health and body composition than anything else.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. That might be concerning because being single can lead to issues like substance abuse, financial instability, or emotional problems. But I'm not sure how much that contributes to his risk level.\n\nHe's enrolled in school at the present moment. This could mean he's trying to build a future, but it doesn't directly indicate a high risk factor unless there are underlying issues related to education or personal circumstances.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. That might lead to substance abuse problems because single individuals often have more drug use problems. But again, this isn't a high risk indicator on its own.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This shows he has substance abuse issues but doesn't indicate a high risk level unless combined with other factors like living alone or substance use patterns.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 5. That's more than his current household size, which might suggest some stress or strain on his family life. But again, this isn't a high risk factor by itself.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is interesting because it suggests he's seeking an explanation for his actions and well-being. However, without more context about how this affects his behavior or health, I can't assess the risk level based on this.\n\nPutting all these factors together, while there are signs of substance abuse and living alone, they don't seem to be high-risk indicators by themselves. The arrest history is concerning but not necessarily indicative of a severe risk unless other factors like substance use patterns or family stress contribute significantly.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
