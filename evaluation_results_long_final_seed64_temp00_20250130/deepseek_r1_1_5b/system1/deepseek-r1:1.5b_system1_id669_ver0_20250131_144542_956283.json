    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this person and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as mixed race. That could be a red flag because it might imply some form of racial discrimination or potential biases in her life. Mixed-race individuals can face challenges related to identity, which might affect their decision-making and behavior.\n\nShe has been arrested five times and convicted. This is concerning because multiple convictions can indicate serious criminal activity. However, I should consider if the person is under a protective order or if there's some leniency involved. If she's on protective orders, that could be mitigated, but it still raises red flags about her character.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 pounds. That seems normal for an 18-year-old, so no immediate risk there. Her height is within the average range, and weight is also in a typical range for this age group.\n\nShe's never been married and is currently living alone. This could indicate issues with her relationships or financial stability if she's living alone. However, living alone isn't inherently a high-risk factor unless it affects her ability to support herself financially or emotionally.\n\nHer weight of 150-174 lbs is within the healthy range for an 18-year-old, so no immediate risk there. Her height and weight are also in line with typical ranges for this age group.\n\nShe's a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. This could mean she hasn't attended college or has some work experience. However, without further information on her education background, it's hard to assess the potential risks here.\n\nShe's not currently enrolled in college and hasn't used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is concerning because drug use can lead to serious mental health issues, including depression. However, without knowing if she has a history of substance abuse or if her behavior changes with substance use, it's hard to assess the risk.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This could imply some form of religious bias or lack of understanding about how personal circumstances are influenced by external factors like God. It might raise red flags about her character and decision-making abilities.\n\nShe lived with her adoptive parent(s) in a household of size 5, in a rural area. Living in a small family can sometimes lead to stress or challenges related to community issues, but it's not inherently high-risk unless there are specific concerns about the environment or relationships within the family.\n\nShe doesn't consider God to have anything to do with her personal life. This could mean she lacks understanding of how external factors like God influence her behavior and decisions. It might raise red flags about her character and potential biases in her interactions with others.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some concerns about her past criminal history, weight, substance use, and religious beliefs, these don't necessarily indicate a high risk unless they have specific implications or if there's some mitigating factor like protective orders. However, the lack of any mitigating factors makes me lean towards NO for high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
