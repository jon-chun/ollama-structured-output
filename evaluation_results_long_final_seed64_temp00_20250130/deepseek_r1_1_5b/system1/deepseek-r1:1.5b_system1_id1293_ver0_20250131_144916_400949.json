    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors presented and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's interesting because race can sometimes be a sign of underlying issues or potential problems in a relationship. But I'm not sure how significant that is on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. Four arrests seem like a lot for someone his age, especially if they're not involved in any criminal activities. Conviction could indicate serious past behavior, but it's hard to tell without more context.\n\nHe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 152 lbs. That's average for his height, so weight might be normal or slightly above average. Not sure how that affects risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently not living alone. Being single can sometimes lead to issues with relationships, but again, it's unclear if this is a high-risk factor on its own.\n\nHis height (5'4\") and weight (152 lbs) are both within normal ranges for his age, so I don't think these factors significantly increase the risk assessment.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. That means he's not pursuing higher education, which could be a sign of potential academic issues or lack of interest. But without more context, it's hard to say if this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and doesn't currently use drugs. This seems concerning because drug use can lead to serious health problems and legal consequences. However, I'm not sure how often he has been using drugs or if there are any patterns that could indicate a higher risk.\n\nAll of his time during the past month has felt so down in the dumps\u2014nothing could cheer him up. That's a strong indicator of emotional distress. It suggests he might be feeling unstable or overwhelmed, which can lead to criminal behavior or addiction.\n\nHe was raised by his biological mother in an urban household of size two and considers God involved with his personal issues. This is concerning because it raises questions about his family dynamics and potential influence on his behavior. Urban living can sometimes lead to stress or isolation, but without more information, it's hard to assess the risk level.\n\nPutting all these factors together, especially the emotional downpour, lack of substance use history, and family dynamics, I think this person is at a higher risk for criminal behavior or addiction.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
