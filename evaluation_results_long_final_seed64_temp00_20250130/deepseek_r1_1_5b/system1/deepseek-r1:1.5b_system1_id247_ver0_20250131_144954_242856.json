    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately strike me as a high risk factor, but it's something to consider. He has been arrested twice and convicted, which is concerning because criminal activity can be serious. His weight is 275 lbs, which seems normal for his age, so that might not be an issue.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. That could indicate a family history of criminal behavior, but I'm not sure how significant that is without more context. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which means he hasn't completed formal education. That might raise some red flags because higher education can be associated with better opportunities and less risk.\n\nHe's married and living in an urban area where there are a lot of criminal activities. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, so that could contribute to his risk. He has two jobs during the year, which suggests he's employed or at least not entirely dependent on a single source of income. That might be less concerning than someone who works part-time.\n\nHe's been using drugs in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't reported feeling depressed over the past month. Using substances can lead to serious health issues, so that's something to watch out for. His family background is also important because living with both biological parents in a small household might have contributed to his criminal history.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal life, which could be interpreted as seeking redemption or understanding his past. That's interesting but not necessarily a high risk factor unless it leads to deeper issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nPutting all this together, while he has some concerning aspects like being arrested and using drugs, the context of his family background in an urban area with higher crime rates might make him more at risk. However, without knowing his criminal history beyond two arrests, it's hard to say definitively. But given that he's married and living in a high-crime area, I think there's a reasonable chance he could be at a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
