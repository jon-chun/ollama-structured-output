Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male from Asian/Pacific Islander background. I don't know how common recidivism is among this demographic, but generally, it can vary based on various societal factors.\n\nHe has been arrested five times but not convicted. That might be a red flag because multiple arrests could indicate underlying issues that haven't been resolved yet. However, since he hasn't been convicted, maybe the charges were dismissed or he's in a situation where he's avoiding incarceration.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 145 lbs. Not sure how relevant this is unless there's something about his physical condition affecting his ability to work or contribute, but it doesn't immediately point to high risk.\n\nHe's single and living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because he might have fewer social support networks which could increase the risk of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Not finishing education might leave him with less skills or opportunities, potentially increasing his risk of involvement in the criminal system again.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substance abuse, lack of purpose, which are all risk factors for further criminal behavior.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a known precursor to more serious drug use and could contribute to other risky behaviors. Not feeling depressed might suggest he's not motivated towards positive activities or seeking help.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of two in an urban area. Growing up in an environment without a mother might affect his emotional stability and ability to form healthy relationships, which can increase risk.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or guidance, which some studies suggest might be associated with higher recidivism rates as there's no one to guide him towards positive choices.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests without convictions, living alone, no job, drug use, and a belief in no divine involvement. These factors seem to point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
