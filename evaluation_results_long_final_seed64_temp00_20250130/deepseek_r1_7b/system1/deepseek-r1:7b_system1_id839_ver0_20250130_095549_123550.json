    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might have different propensities compared to older ones. Being White doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are systemic issues at play, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior, so that's a red flag pointing towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch, and his weight is between 150-174 lbs. This places him in an underweight category for his height, which might indicate health issues or substance abuse. Underweight individuals are sometimes at higher risk for certain health problems that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others can provide emotional support, so this factor might actually lower the risk. However, it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; not completing higher education might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking employment opportunities that could lead to further issues.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can contribute to stress and substance abuse, both of which are known risk factors for recidivism.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years and felt down for much of the past month. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential future criminal behavior, especially if it's been ongoing or increasing.\n\nHis background: at a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. This could suggest family dysfunction or exposure to adverse childhood experiences, which are associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This lack of religious support might lead him towards self-identified spirituality or other non-traditional beliefs, which can sometimes be linked to risky behaviors.\n\nPutting all these factors together: prior arrest and conviction, underweight status, drug use, family background, and personal beliefs all point towards a high risk profile. The combination suggests that this individual is likely to pose significant risks if not properly managed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
