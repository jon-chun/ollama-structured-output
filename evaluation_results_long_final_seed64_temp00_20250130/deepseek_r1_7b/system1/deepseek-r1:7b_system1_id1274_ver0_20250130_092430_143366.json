    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male Hispanic. Age is usually low risk unless there are other factors, but being young might reduce risk. Hispanic background isn't inherently high or low risk without more info.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Twice arrests could indicate some issues, but since he hasn't been convicted, maybe the charges were expunged? That would lower the risk compared to a conviction.\n\nHis height is 5'10\" and weight 202 lbs. No immediate red flags here; it's about body type rather than health indicators.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Not sure how that ties into risk, but maybe living with others could mean more support or less isolation.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in a 4-year college suggests he has some education, which might correlate with better job opportunities and lower risk compared to those without education.\n\nHe's held four jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs can indicate stability, so that's a positive sign for low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone doesn't necessarily mean high risk if he's not experiencing severe issues.\n\nReligious involvement: He believes God has something to do with his personal events. Religious factors can sometimes correlate with lower risk as people might be more committed and less likely to engage in risky behavior.\n\nLooking at the factors, most of them lean towards low risk. The two arrests without a conviction are a point against him, but considering he's young, educated, and has multiple jobs, these factors balance out. I don't see any strong indicators pointing towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
