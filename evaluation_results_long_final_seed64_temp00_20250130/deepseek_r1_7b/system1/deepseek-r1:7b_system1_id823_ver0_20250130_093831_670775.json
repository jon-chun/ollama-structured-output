    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 20-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which usually indicates higher risk as recidivism is common among repeat offenders.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I don't see how that affects the risk here unless there are specific racial biases in the system, which isn't provided. So maybe not much impact on this assessment.\n\nHer height and weight aren't directly relevant to her risk unless they relate to physical danger, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse. Marital stability is generally positive for recidivism rates because it often provides support structures.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college suggests she has some education but may lack higher education or skills that could contribute to better job opportunities or self-sufficiency, which might be a risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Single job experience isn't inherently bad, but if she's been unemployed for long periods, it could indicate other issues like substance use or personal problems.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is concerning because even if it's non-addictive, frequent drug use can lead to health issues and behavioral problems. Also, recent feelings of low mood might be a sign of underlying mental health issues.\n\nLiving at age 20 with six adults other than her parents could indicate family instability or neglect, which are risk factors for substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has some level of religious support, which can sometimes provide coping mechanisms but doesn't directly correlate to high risk unless there's evidence of spiritual issues affecting her behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (3), drug use (past 4 years), living with multiple adults, and recent low mood are strong indicators. The other factors like education level and marital status don't necessarily add much positive weight but also aren't mitigating factors. Considering the high number of prior convictions and possible substance abuse, I'd lean towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 6. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
