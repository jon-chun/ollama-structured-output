    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female Hispanic. Age is often a marker of vulnerability, especially in certain populations. Her Hispanic background might be associated with specific risk factors or experiences that could contribute to her behavior.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can still indicate some level of criminal history and potential for future issues, even if it's not on a formal record yet.\n\nHer height is 5'3\" and she weighs 110 lbs. While weight isn't directly a risk factor, her BMI might be low given her age and height, but without more info on body mass or health indicators, I can't assess that here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living independently could mean less support network, which sometimes correlates with higher risk of substance use or antisocial behavior.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school or college might leave her with limited opportunities and could contribute to risky behaviors like drug use.\n\nShe's held 5 jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can indicate adaptability, but it also shows she's been employed enough times that she might have some stability, which could be a protective factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential for addiction, which can lead to further legal issues or family problems.\n\nMost of the time during the past month, she feels down and can't find cheer. Persistent feelings of low mood might suggest depression or anxiety, both of which are linked to higher risk of substance use and criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of three in an urban area. Early exposure to a chaotic home environment is often associated with higher risk of criminal behavior, substance abuse, and other negative outcomes.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal issues. While religious belief can be protective against some forms of delinquency, it's not always the case, especially if there are personal struggles that could stem from deeper issues like trauma or neglect.\n\nPutting all these together: a single arrest, drug use, living in a potentially unstable household, and negative emotional state. These factors collectively suggest a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
