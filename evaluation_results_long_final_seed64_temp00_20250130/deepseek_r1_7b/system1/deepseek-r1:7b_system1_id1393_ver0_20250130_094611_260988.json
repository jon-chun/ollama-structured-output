    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female of African American descent. Minorities often have different risk profiles compared to non-minorities, so that might be a red flag.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest can sometimes indicate prior issues or maybe she's actively trying to avoid trouble. However, since it's not a conviction, the impact might be less severe than someone with a full record.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant unless there's an issue with her health related to these factors, which isn't indicated here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors or substance abuse, but it depends on other factors like support networks.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Not completing college might be linked to lower educational support systems, which could increase risk of not seeking help when needed.\n\nShe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can sometimes indicate stability, but if she's frequently changing jobs due to instability or lack of career focus, that could be a concern.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood for part of the month. Drug use, especially marijuana, is associated with potential substance abuse issues, which can affect mental health and risk behaviors. The recent mood issue might suggest underlying mental health concerns or stressors.\n\nShe lived at a young age in a household of three with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting could have emotional or psychological impacts, possibly leading to higher risk of mental health issues or substance abuse later on.\n\nConsidering God's influence on her life adds a personal aspect that might relate to her spirituality and mental health, but it doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are underlying religious issues affecting her behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: The factors don't immediately jump out as high-risk. She has some negative points like drug use and past arrest, but the lack of conviction and multiple jobs might mitigate some risks. However, considering the potential for underlying mental health issues from living in a household with her mother at a young age could be significant. Her minority status also adds to the consideration.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some risk factors, they don't all point strongly to high risk without more information on each individual aspect.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
