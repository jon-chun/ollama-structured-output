    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age-wise, she's quite young, but being White might not directly correlate with higher risk unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting White individuals more often than others. I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest can increase the risk of reoffending, so this is definitely a red flag.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches and she weighs 120 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like weight or height typically indicate risk unless there are health issues involved, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to higher risk of substance abuse or other risky behaviors. But without more info on her mental health or living situation specifics, it's hard to quantify the risk.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree could mean she might be struggling with basic needs or facing barriers to better opportunities, increasing her risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nShe has held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability and reduce stress, so this isn't a strong risk factor on its own.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a direct indicator of risky behavior, especially if it's recent or if she's using substances that could impair judgment or increase criminal tendencies. However, since she hasn't felt depressed lately, maybe her drug use isn't severe enough to directly correlate with high risk.\n\nShe lived at a young age with her biological mother in a household of three. Early exposure might have some impact on behavior, but without knowing if there were any issues or neglect, it's hard to assess the risk here.\n\nLastly, she believes in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior; however, this alone doesn't indicate high risk unless there are other factors suggesting she might be influenced by religion in a problematic way.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior convictions (3) is a strong indicator of high risk. Her lack of education and employment history also contribute. The drug use isn't severe but adds to the mix. The rest don't seem to add significant risk unless there's more on that front. So, I'd lean towards high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
