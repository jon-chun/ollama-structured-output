    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being 19 might be considered at-risk age in some contexts, but it also depends on his criminal history and other factors. He has been arrested five times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of risk because they show a history of violating the law.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 230 lbs. That makes him quite heavy; obesity is often associated with higher risk in various areas like substance use, health issues, and maybe even criminal behavior if it's related to health problems or substance abuse.\n\nHe's living alone, which can be a red flag for several reasons: potential isolation leading to substance abuse, lack of support network which might contribute to risky behaviors, or possible neglect. He hasn't been married and is currently living alone, so that adds another layer of risk factors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can lead to unstable situations, increased reliance on substance abuse, and lower chances of finding positive opportunities which might contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Having a steady job is important for financial stability and providing a sense of purpose. If someone is unemployed or underemployed, it can lead to economic stress and potentially more risky behavior.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for various issues including criminal behavior, health problems, and family dysfunction. It's concerning that he's using these substances regularly.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While not experiencing depression might seem positive, it could also be a sign of avoidance or suppression of underlying mental health issues which might contribute to other risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. This suggests he was raised in a multi-parent household in a city, which can have its own set of challenges but doesn't immediately indicate high risk unless there are specific issues like abuse or neglect.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal life. While religious beliefs can be protective against certain types of behavior, it's not directly linked to high risk unless there are underlying issues related to spirituality and support systems.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests (5), conviction, heavy weight, living alone, no education or college, only one job, drug use, lack of recent depression. These factors strongly indicate a high risk. The individual has a history of criminal behavior, health issues due to obesity and substance abuse, and lacks support from education and employment which can contribute to further risky behaviors.\n\nI think the confidence level should be quite high here\u2014maybe around 90%. He's got several solid indicators pointing towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
