    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male Hispanic. Age is usually not a strong indicator on its own, but being young might mean he's still developing his skills and could be more prone to making mistakes. Being Hispanic doesn't directly correlate with higher risk unless there are systemic issues, which I don't have information on.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest can increase the risk of reoffending. Convictions, especially for serious crimes, definitely raise the bar.\n\nHis height is 5'11\" and weight between 200-224 lbs. This might indicate he's sedentary or has health issues, but without knowing his BMI or medical history, it's hard to say. However, being overweight can be a risk factor for certain crimes if he's associated with high-risk groups.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. But since he has no family nearby, maybe he's isolated, which could contribute to risky behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not completing higher education might leave him without support and more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive as it can provide stability, but if he's not employed properly or is underemployed, that could be a risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, isn't necessarily linked to depression unless there are underlying issues. However, drug use itself can lead to risky behaviors like substance abuse.\n\nHe's never felt depressed over the past month. If he hasn't experienced depression recently, it might indicate better mental health, which could reduce risk. But prior experiences don't always correlate with current state.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting can have mixed effects; while it provides support, it might also lead to dependency if there's neglect or abuse.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior positively but could also lead to risky decisions influenced by religion if there are underlying issues like alcoholism or drug use.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions, age, living situation, lack of education, substance use (marijuana), and maybe some risk factors from the other points. The high number of prior arrests and lack of education would likely point towards a high risk. However, since he's 20, maybe his risk is moderate to low? But considering the other factors like drug use and living alone, it might still be high.\n\nI think overall, despite some mitigating factors like being young and having no family nearby, the prior convictions, lack of education, and substance use push him towards a high risk. So I'll go with \"YES\" with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
