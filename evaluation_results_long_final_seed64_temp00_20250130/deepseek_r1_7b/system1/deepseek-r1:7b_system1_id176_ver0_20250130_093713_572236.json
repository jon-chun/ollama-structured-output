    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being Black can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates in certain areas, but that depends on the context and systemic issues. However, without specific data linking his race to risk, I shouldn't assume it's high risk just based on that.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest can increase the risk of reoffending, especially with multiple convictions. This is a strong indicator towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 11 inches and he weighs 165 lbs. While weight and height aren't directly predictive of criminal behavior, combined with other factors like being a first-time offender or not having a support system, they might influence the risk assessment. But alone, it's not enough to conclude high risk.\n\nHe is living alone, never married, and currently single. Living alone can be isolating, which might lead him to engage in risky behaviors out of loneliness or a lack of support network. This could increase his risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not completing higher education might leave him with fewer opportunities and more time to engage in risky activities. This is another point towards high risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which means he's unemployed or underemployed. Without income, individuals are more likely to turn to illegal activities as a means of survival. This definitely points towards high risk.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Drug use can lead to impulsive behaviors and increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. However, the lack of recent depression might suggest he's not struggling mentally, but drug use is still a risk factor.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at age 5 in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting can have both protective and negative effects. Urban environments sometimes have higher crime rates, which could contribute to increased risk.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief might provide some level of moral guidance or support, potentially reducing the likelihood of risky behavior compared to someone without such a belief.\n\nPutting all these factors together: multiple prior convictions, living alone, no job, drug use, and a lack of support network (since he's never married and single) all point towards high risk. The presence of prior convictions is particularly strong, as each one can increase the likelihood of reoffending. While some factors like his race or religious belief might have varying impacts, the overall profile leans towards high risk.\n\nI should assign a confidence level based on how many factors are pointing towards high risk. With 10 prior arrests and other negative factors, I'm fairly confident (maybe around 85%) that this individual is at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
