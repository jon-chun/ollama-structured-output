    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female from American Indian background. Her age is quite young, which might be a mitigating factor since she's still developing her skills and life experiences. However, her past behavior could be significant.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can indicate potential issues with law enforcement or previous encounters that may have led to negative outcomes. But since there are no convictions, it might not show a long-term criminal history.\n\nHer height is 5'5\" and weight 140 lbs. This doesn't immediately raise red flags regarding her physical health unless there's an underlying condition, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stability in a relationship can be protective as it suggests she has support system in place.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. This could mean she's facing educational barriers, possibly leading to substance abuse issues as indicated by her drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for various behaviors that can impact her ability to function responsibly.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness often correlates with higher rates of substance abuse, lack of income support, and potential issues with mental health, which she's mentioned feeling down in the dumps at times.\n\nIn the past month, she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates possible depression or a mood disorder, both of which are significant risk factors for various behaviors, including substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area at a young age. Growing up in such an environment can have emotional and psychological impacts, potentially leading to issues like substance abuse, anxiety, or depression as she ages.\n\nLastly, she believes that God has something to do with her personal events. This could relate to her spiritual beliefs influencing her behavior, but it's not clear if this is a protective factor or if it might indicate other underlying issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: two arrests (no convictions), young age, living in a rural household, substance abuse, lack of education and employment, and emotional distress. These points collectively suggest she may be at a higher risk for further issues such as substance abuse, mental health problems, or criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
