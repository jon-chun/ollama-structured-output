    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being in his early twenties might be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals, but it's not always the case. However, race can play a significant role in recidivism statistics, so that should be considered.\n\nHe has been arrested 6 times but hasn't been convicted yet. Multiple arrests are a red flag because each arrest increases the chances of future involvement in the criminal system. Not being convicted might mean he's not taking his responsibilities seriously or is avoiding legal consequences, which could indicate a lack of commitment to change.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to risk assessment unless there's an underlying health issue, but since no such information is provided, I'll ignore this for now.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to feelings of depression or anxiety. These mental health issues could increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates because individuals with higher education are more likely to seek employment opportunities and improve their lives. Not having this qualification might suggest he's not prioritizing his future, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on social services, substance abuse, or other risky behaviors. It also indicates that he may not have the skills necessary for productive life choices.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years and all month long feels down. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential negative outcomes, including further criminal involvement if he decides to use substances to cope with stress or emotions. Feeling down every month could suggest underlying mental health issues that might be contributing to his drug use.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of four. Larger households can sometimes lead to more supervision and less stability, especially at younger ages. This environment might have contributed to his current behavior patterns without proper support.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his personal life. While religious beliefs can provide guidance, they don't necessarily protect against criminal behavior if other factors are present. However, this factor alone doesn't strongly indicate high risk unless combined with other negative traits.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and living in a potentially unstable household. These factors collectively suggest a high risk of engaging in risky behaviors or reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
