    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. I know there can be some disparities in how risk assessments are done based on race and ethnicity, but that might not directly translate to criminal behavior unless there's evidence of systemic issues or bias. So maybe this is a minor factor.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests without convictions don't always indicate high risk because they could be expunged if he paid fines or Probation/Parole. So that might not be a strong indicator either.\n\nHis height and weight are listed, 6 feet 2 inches and 230 lbs. I'm not sure how relevant this is unless there's a history of substance abuse related to his weight, but it doesn't seem directly connected here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of higher risk because it might mean he has fewer social support systems or could be more vulnerable to isolation leading to self-harm or other issues. But again, this depends on the context.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now, which suggests he's actively trying to change his situation and isn't likely to engage in criminal behavior. Education is usually a protective factor against recidivism.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Having multiple job opportunities can indicate stability and self-sufficiency, reducing the risk of engaging in illegal activities or further trouble.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct indicator unless it's linked to other negative behaviors like substance abuse disorders which could increase risk.\n\nHe doesn't feel depressed over the past month, so that's positive. No recent emotional distress might suggest he's mentally stable and less likely to engage in harmful behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a larger household can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to potential exposure to negative influences or stressors from the environment. Urban areas might have different social dynamics that could affect his behavior.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life, which is a strong indicator of moral stability and likely positive outcomes. Religious affiliation often correlates with higher self-discipline and lower risk behaviors compared to those without such support.\n\nPutting it all together: He's got multiple protective factors like being in school, having jobs, living alone, and religious involvement. The only negative points are past drug use and two arrests without convictions. However, the lack of conviction is a mitigating factor because expungements can clear records if paid properly. The presence of living with his mother might be a minor concern but not enough to outweigh other protective factors.\n\nConsidering all these, I think he's on the lower risk side. So my prediction would be \"NO\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
