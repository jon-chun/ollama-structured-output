    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 18 might be considered at risk because it's early in life, but without more context, I can't say much yet.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions; each arrest increases the risk of recidivism.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 215 lbs. While weight and height aren't directly predictive of risk, combined with other factors like living alone or drug use, they might contribute to health issues that could affect his ability to commit further crimes.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness, which he admitted to feeling down in the dumps for some time. Loneliness is a known risk factor for substance abuse and mental health issues, both of which can increase recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not completing higher education might leave him with fewer opportunities or skills that could help him avoid further trouble.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive as it shows he can support himself, but if he's not stable economically, that could be a risk.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, particularly marijuana recently. Drug use is strongly linked to criminal behavior and health issues, which can impede his ability to reintegrate into society positively.\n\nHe felt so down for some of the past month; nothing could cheer him up. Persistent feelings of low mood are indicative of depression or anxiety, both mental health conditions that can contribute to substance abuse and risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of seven. High family size is often associated with higher risk of criminal behavior due to factors like lack of supervision or environment conducive to delinquency.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with his personal events. While religious beliefs can vary, some may associate spirituality with better decision-making, but others might struggle with it, potentially leading to risky choices.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, living in a large family, and signs of mental health issues like depression or loneliness all point towards high risk. The individual's history suggests he has a higher likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
