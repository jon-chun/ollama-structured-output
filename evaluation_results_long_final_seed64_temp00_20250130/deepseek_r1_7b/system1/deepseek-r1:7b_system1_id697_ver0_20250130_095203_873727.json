    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male of White ethnicity. That doesn't immediately raise red flags, but it's worth noting as part of his background.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest can increase the risk of reoffending, so this is a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 170 lbs. I don't see an immediate issue with his weight or height unless it relates to substance use, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor in some cases, but without more context on his living situation stability, it might not directly contribute to risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing high school or college can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, so this could indicate a high risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness is often linked to poverty and substance abuse, both of which are associated with higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's leading to other negative behaviors or if he has a history of drug-related offenses.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite using drugs. This might suggest he's managing his substance use without severe mental health issues, which could be a protective factor against more severe recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults who aren't his biological parents in a household of two in a rural area. This could indicate family instability or exposure to adverse environments, which can increase risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and considers it unrelated to his personal events. This lack of religious support might affect his coping mechanisms or belief systems that could influence behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, living alone without a job, and not completing education are all strong indicators of high risk. The factors don't seem to balance out into low risk at all.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
