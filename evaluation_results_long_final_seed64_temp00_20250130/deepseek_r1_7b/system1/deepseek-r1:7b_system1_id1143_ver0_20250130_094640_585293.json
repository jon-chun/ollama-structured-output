    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their impact.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male Hispanic. Age 21 is relatively young, but being Hispanic doesn't inherently make him more or less risky. I don't have specific data on crime rates among different ethnic groups, so maybe this isn't the most significant factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest can sometimes indicate prior issues, but since it's not a conviction, maybe he hasn't faced the consequences yet. However, being arrested even once can be a red flag for potential future issues.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 5 inches and weight 130 lbs. That makes him underweight for his height. Underweight individuals might have weaker muscles, which could affect their ability to commit serious crimes if they decide to do so. But this alone isn't a strong indicator of high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Lack of education can sometimes be linked to higher crime rates because individuals might turn to criminal activities as a means of survival or to avoid the system. Living alone could also mean he has fewer support networks, which might increase his risk.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on social services and potentially more involvement with the criminal justice system if he faces issues again. Having no steady income might make him more susceptible to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a concern. Drug use, especially with substances like cocaine, can impair judgment and lead to impulsive decisions that might contribute to criminal behavior. It's also possible that drug use could be linked to other negative outcomes, such as family issues or mental health concerns.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While not experiencing depression isn't necessarily a positive indicator, it's important to consider if there are underlying mental health issues that aren't being addressed. Sometimes substance abuse can coexist with mental health problems, which might increase risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of seven in an urban area. Siblinghood living at such a young age and in a large family could have various implications. It might indicate a lack of supervision or emotional support from parents, which can contribute to behavioral issues later on. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, so this could be another risk factor.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could relate to religious fundamentalism or lack of faith, which sometimes correlates with criminal behavior, especially if it leads to a lack of moral compass or increased impulsive actions.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest, no education, living alone, unemployment, drug use, and family living conditions that might be unstable. These factors collectively suggest a moderate to high risk. The presence of prior substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) is particularly concerning as it can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior or other negative outcomes.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards a \"YES\" with a confidence level around 75%. There are clear indicators that could lead to higher risk behaviors, but without more information on his current situation or any recent changes, this is an informed guess.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
