    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a consideration in risk assessment because younger individuals might be more prone to making impulsive decisions or facing challenges that could lead to further issues. However, without knowing his criminal history beyond two arrests and no convictions, it's hard to say how much weight to give that.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That's a bit concerning because even if he's not convicted of the charges, prior arrests can still impact his risk profile. It might indicate some level of trouble with the law in the past, which could be a red flag.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches and weight between 150-174 lbs. That seems within a normal range for an 18-year-old male, so I don't think that's particularly high risk on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher levels of stress or loneliness, which might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors. However, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Having a steady job is generally positive as it provides stability and economic independence. If he lost his job recently, that could be concerning, but since it's just once, maybe it's not too bad.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can have significant negative consequences on an individual's life, including academic performance, social interactions, and mental health. It might also increase the likelihood of engaging in other risky behaviors or seeking more substances.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While not feeling depressed could be a positive sign, it's important to consider if there are underlying issues that aren't being addressed. Depression can affect drug use patterns as well.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a multi-parent household in an urban setting might have its own set of challenges and could influence his behavior or decision-making processes.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief can sometimes provide a sense of direction but might also be a coping mechanism for stress or anxiety if he's struggling with other areas of his life.\n\nPutting all these together, the key factors are the prior arrests and drug use. The two arrests could indicate some underlying issues that haven't been resolved, which might lead to more impulsive decisions. The drug use is concerning as it can have long-term effects on his ability to function in school or society. While other factors like living alone aren't necessarily high risk, they do contribute to potential stressors.\n\nConsidering the context and the presence of prior criminal behavior and substance abuse, I would lean towards a high risk but not certain. The confidence level is moderate because while there are red flags, it's not an absolute guarantee without more information on his current situation or any other risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
