    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a consideration in risk assessment; younger individuals might be at lower risk compared to adults, but it can vary based on other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests are significant because they indicate past behavior that may pose a risk of reoffending or causing harm to others. Each prior conviction increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. While weight can be an indicator, it's not always directly correlated with risk unless combined with other factors like BMI or body fat percentage. His weight here doesn't immediately raise a red flag.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk of substance abuse or isolation, but again, this depends on other factors like his support network.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now, which suggests he has some level of education and might be motivated to change his behavior. Education often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Joblessness can lead to dependency issues, such as substance abuse or lack of life skills, which could increase risk.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning because it can impair judgment and decision-making. However, the fact that he hasn't felt depressed might suggest he's managing his use, but it's still a red flag.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in a multi-parent household in an urban setting can sometimes be protective or not depending on other factors like family dynamics and environment.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This could indicate a strong moral compass or belief system, which might reduce risk if he's using it constructively, but it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues.\n\nPutting this all together: He has prior convictions, drug use, and is currently jobless while enrolled in school. These factors suggest he may have a higher risk of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior. The presence of prior convictions alone can significantly increase the risk assessment score. Additionally, living without a support system (living alone) combined with substance abuse could amplify his risk.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards a high risk but not necessarily 100% confidence because some factors might mitigate it, like his education and belief in God. However, given the number of significant risk indicators, my confidence level is around 75%. It's on the higher side but acknowledges that other mitigating factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
