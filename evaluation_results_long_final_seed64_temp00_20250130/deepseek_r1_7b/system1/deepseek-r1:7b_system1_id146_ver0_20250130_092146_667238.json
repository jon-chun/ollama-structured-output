    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female from White background. Age is usually not a strong indicator on its own, but being young might mean she's still developing her life skills and hasn't faced significant challenges yet.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted. That's two convictions, which could be a red flag because criminal history can predict future behavior. But since she's only 22, maybe it's early in her life.\n\nHer height is 5'7\" and weight 135 lbs. No immediate risk factors from this; it's more about physical characteristics than behavior.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors like isolation leading to substance use or other issues, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Not enrolled in college might mean she's focused on work or other areas, which could be positive, but it also shows she may have struggled with academics before.\n\nShe's held five jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can indicate stability and ability to manage finances, so that's a good sign against high risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use without significant mental health issues might not be a strong indicator unless there are other signs of substance abuse like addiction or neglect.\n\nShe lived in a household of three at a young age, which could indicate family support, so that's less concerning.\n\nHer religious belief is mentioned as something she considers important but doesn't directly relate to risk factors. It's more about personal values than behavior indicators.\n\nPutting it all together: Two arrests and convictions are present, but the individual is relatively young and has a stable background. The lack of significant substance abuse issues (except in the past) and living with family might mitigate some risks. However, two prior convictions could still be a moderate risk factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
