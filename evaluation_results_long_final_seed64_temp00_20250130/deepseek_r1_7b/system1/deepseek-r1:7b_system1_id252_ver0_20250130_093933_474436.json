    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male from an Asian/Pacific Islander background. I don't know how common that is in criminal justice contexts, but it's not immediately red flaggy.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which usually indicates higher risk because recidivism rates are typically high for repeat offenders.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 230 lbs. I don't see an immediate issue with his weight unless it's associated with health problems, but there's no information on that here.\n\nHe's married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because of potential isolation or lack of support networks, which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational barriers often correlate with higher recidivism rates as individuals may turn to other avenues for survival or opportunities.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive, but if he's not employed full-time, it might indicate instability, which can be a risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, but he felt down for much of the past month. Persistent feelings of low mood could suggest underlying mental health issues or substance abuse problems that aren't being acknowledged.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with 10 other people. That's a large household size, which can be dangerous and may contribute to higher risk behaviors like drug use or domestic violence.\n\nHe believes in God as a factor in his personal outcomes. While religious beliefs can influence behavior, it doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are issues related to that belief.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions, lack of education, living alone, possible isolation leading to substance abuse, and a history of negative emotional states. These factors collectively point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
