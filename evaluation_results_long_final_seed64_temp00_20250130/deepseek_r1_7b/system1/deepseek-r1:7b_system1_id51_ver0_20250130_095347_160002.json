    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female Hispanic with three arrests but no convictions. That might suggest some underlying issues or maybe she's been in trouble before without getting serious consequences. Next, her height and weight don't immediately raise red flags, so I'll note that as neutral factors.\n\nShe's living alone, never married, and hasn't held a job this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might indicate instability or lack of support network. She has a high school diploma but isn't pursuing college, which could mean she's not seeking better opportunities or maybe facing challenges in her current situation.\n\nHer drug use history is clean for the past four years, so that's positive. Her recent feelings of low mood most of the time might indicate some underlying mental health issues. She experienced trauma at a young age with five siblings in an urban area, which could contribute to behavioral problems or emotional instability later on.\n\nShe mentions considering God as part of her life, which is a strong indicator of religious involvement and support system. That's usually protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nPutting it all together: three arrests without convictions might suggest past issues but not necessarily current high risk. Her living situation and recent mood could be concerning, but her lack of job experience and education might also contribute to instability. However, the lack of drug use and religious involvement are positive signs that mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some red flags, they don't all point in the same direction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
