    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male Hispanic. Age 18 is still considered a minor, which might be a protective factor, but his other issues could outweigh that.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, especially at such a young age. Each arrest can increase the risk of recidivism.\n\nHis height is 5'5\" and weight 145 lbs. No direct info on BMI or health issues here, but combined with other factors, it might be relevant later.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation, which is a risk factor for various issues including substance abuse and mental health problems.\n\nEnrolled in school now. While education can help reduce recidivism, being out of school for extended periods can increase risk if he's not engaged or seeking help.\n\nNo job during the year. Unemployment or lack of employment can lead to dependency on substances, lack of support system, and increased stress.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some use in the last month is concerning, especially with feelings of low mood affecting his mental state. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential for substance abuse issues, which can contribute to high risk.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in such conditions might have contributed to behavioral or emotional issues, possibly leading to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support system, which is often associated with higher rates of substance abuse and delinquency.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, living in an environment that might not provide the necessary support or guidance, isolation, lack of employment, and personal beliefs affecting his spirituality. These factors collectively point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
