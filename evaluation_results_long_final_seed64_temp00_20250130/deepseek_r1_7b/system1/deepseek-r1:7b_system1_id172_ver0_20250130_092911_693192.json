    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female Hispanic. Age is often a consideration in risk assessments; younger individuals might be more prone to change or have fewer life experiences. Her ethnicity doesn't directly indicate risk but could influence social support factors.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest can sometimes signal potential for substance abuse issues, which I see she does use marijuana. Substance abuse is a known risk factor, especially when combined with feelings of low mood affecting her motivation to work or engage socially.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 174 lbs. While this doesn't directly indicate risk, her current living situation alone (living alone) can be a red flag for isolation, which might lead to emotional distress or substance use as coping mechanisms.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone without support can contribute to feelings of loneliness and depression, both of which are linked to higher risk behaviors like drug use.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. This indicates she may have limited opportunities for positive engagement or education, potentially leading to substance abuse as a way to cope with stress or lack of purpose.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to financial instability and increased reliance on substances to manage stress or mood swings.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) in the past four years, especially recent use, is concerning. Substance use disorders are strong predictors of recidivism and high risk behavior.\n\nShe felt so down in the past month that nothing could cheer her up. Persistent feelings of low mood can indicate depression, which is a significant risk factor for further substance abuse and criminal behavior.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in a household of four in an urban area at a young age suggests exposure to a chaotic environment, which can contribute to emotional instability and substance use as coping mechanisms.\n\nLastly, her lack of religious affiliation might lead to coping strategies outside of spirituality, potentially contributing to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors together\u2014arrest history, substance use, isolation, limited education, joblessness, mood issues\u2014it's clear that this individual is at a high risk. The combination of multiple risk factors points towards significant potential for further negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
