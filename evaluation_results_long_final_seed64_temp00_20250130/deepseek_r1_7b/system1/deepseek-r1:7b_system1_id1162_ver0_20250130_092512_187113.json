    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female Hispanic. Age is typically not a strong indicator of risk unless there are other factors like criminal history or substance use. She has been arrested once but not convicted. That might suggest some underlying issues that led to the arrest, but since it's not a conviction, maybe the impact isn't as significant.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs between 125-149 lbs. This is within a healthy BMI range for her age, so she doesn't appear to be at risk due to weight or physical health issues.\n\nShe's never married and currently not living alone. Living with others can sometimes indicate social support, which might mitigate risk factors like substance use or lack of supervision.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is generally protective unless there are other negative factors like substance abuse or unstable family environment.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment usually provides stability and income, so this alone doesn't indicate high risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a red flag, especially if it's frequent or leads to negative outcomes like depression. However, since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe the impact is lessened.\n\nShe lived with non-biological parents in an urban area at a young age. This could suggest exposure to a chaotic home environment, which might increase risk factors like substance use or behavioral issues.\n\nLastly, she doesn't believe in God and sees no divine intervention in her life. This lack of religious support can sometimes be associated with higher rates of substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest isn't a conviction, so maybe not as significant. Her living situation at a young age could increase risk factors like drug use or instability. She's using drugs but hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean the behavior is less severe than if she were experiencing ongoing issues. Her lack of religious belief and personal philosophy could contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think there's some indication of moderate risk due to her living situation and potential exposure to a chaotic family environment. However, without more specific factors like recent substance use incidents or behavioral changes, the confidence isn't extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
