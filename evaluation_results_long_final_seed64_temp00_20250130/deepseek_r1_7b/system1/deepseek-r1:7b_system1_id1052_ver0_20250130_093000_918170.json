    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male Hispanic. Age-wise, being 20 isn't necessarily a strong indicator of high risk unless there's something else. Being Hispanic might be a minoritized group with different risk profiles, but without more info, I can't assume that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's one misdemeanor. Generally, a single arrest doesn't usually indicate high risk unless it's a serious offense or if there are other factors like substance use or prior convictions.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and he weighs 199 lbs. That makes him quite heavy for his height, which could be an indicator of being underweight or having health issues. Being overweight can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but I don't know if that's the case here.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. He's not enrolled in college. Unemployment or lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because he might be struggling to find stable employment or support systems.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can sometimes indicate good financial stability, but it could also mean he's been moving around a lot, which isn't great for risk assessment.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only) and no recent depression. Drug use is concerning because even if it's marijuana, it can lead to other issues like substance abuse problems, which are known risk factors. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, that might mitigate some of the risks associated with drug use.\n\nHe lived at a young age in a household of five with his biological mother. That suggests he was raised in a multi-parent household, which is generally protective but could also indicate family dysfunction if there are issues within the household.\n\nConsidering his religion, he believes God has something to do with his personal events. This might relate to his motivation or belief system, which isn't directly tied to risk unless it's affecting his behavior in ways I'm not aware of.\n\nPutting this all together: one misdemeanor arrest, no prior conviction, living alone, no high school diploma, three jobs, some drug use (marijuana), recent no depression. The factors that could increase risk are the lack of education and previous drug use. However, since he's never been convicted, it might not be a high risk overall.\n\nI think the confidence level should be moderate because there are some risk factors present but also mitigating factors like living situation and lack of convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
