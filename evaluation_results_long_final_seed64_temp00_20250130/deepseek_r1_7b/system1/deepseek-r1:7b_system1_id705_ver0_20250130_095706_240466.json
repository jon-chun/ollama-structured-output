    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being 22 isn't necessarily a red flag unless there's something else indicating immaturity, but I don't see that here. Being White doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are systemic issues, which aren't mentioned.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's one arrest, which is low on the scale of recidivism. Not being convicted might mean he's taking it seriously or maybe it was a minor offense. So that's a negative factor pointing towards lower risk.\n\nHis height and weight: 5 feet 9 inches and 165 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like this are typically considered in risk assessments unless there's something about his behavior related to his size, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and currently not living alone. Not being married could mean he's in a relationship or maybe single but with someone else at home. Living with others doesn't necessarily indicate risk unless there are issues like domestic violence or substance abuse, which aren't mentioned.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; sometimes higher education is associated with better job opportunities and lower recidivism rates. Not going to college might suggest he's looking for more stable employment, but it's not inherently high risk.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. One job isn't a lot, but again, it depends on the industry. Some jobs are more stable than others, but without knowing his occupation or if he has skills in demand, it's hard to say. However, having only one job might indicate some instability if he's been unemployed for a while.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive factors; substance abuse and mental health issues can be significant predictors of recidivism when present, but their absence is good news.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. Sibling count doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there's something about family dynamics or support systems that might affect behavior. Since no other factors are mentioned related to family issues, it's hard to draw conclusions here.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This is a strong indicator of religious involvement and moral alignment. Religious individuals often have different life choices and may be more likely to follow guidelines, which can reduce risk.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest, no convictions, not married or living alone (but maybe with someone), educated but not in college, one job, clean drug history, and a belief in God's role. These factors lean towards lower risk because he has fewer negative traits related to criminal behavior. The lack of significant past issues like substance abuse or mental health problems also supports this.\n\nI think the confidence level should be relatively high since most indicators point towards low risk. Maybe around 60-70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
