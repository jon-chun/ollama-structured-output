    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is often a minor factor in risk assessment, but being young can sometimes mean she's more impressionable or has fewer life experiences that might affect her judgment.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly correlated with recidivism. So this already points towards high risk.\n\nHer race is White. While race isn't the most predictive factor, it can influence risk assessment due to systemic issues or societal biases, though in this case, she has a prior conviction which might overshadow that.\n\nShe's 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. Her height and weight don't immediately indicate much unless there are other factors related to health, but nothing here suggests she's underweight or overweight, so probably not a high risk factor on its own.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher risk of substance abuse and isolation, which might contribute to her current feelings of low mood.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates; not having one could increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability, so this might actually be protective rather than a risk factor.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, with some recent use. Drug abuse is a major red flag as it increases the likelihood of engaging in dangerous behaviors or seeking more illegal substances.\n\nShe felt down for much of the past month. Persistent low mood can indicate underlying mental health issues, which are strong predictors of high risk behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three. This could suggest family dysfunction or potential neglect, both of which are associated with higher risk of problematic behaviors.\n\nLastly, she believes that God has no role in her life. This lack of religious support can sometimes correlate with lower self-discipline and higher risk-taking behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: prior arrest (high risk), drug use (high risk), low education (moderate risk), living alone (possibly high risk due to isolation), recent negative mood, family background (possible high risk), and lack of religious involvement. The strongest indicators are the prior conviction and drug use, which point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
