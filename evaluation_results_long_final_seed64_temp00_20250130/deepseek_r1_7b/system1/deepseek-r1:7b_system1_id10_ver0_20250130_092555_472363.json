    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is usually not a strong indicator of risk unless there are other factors like criminal history or substance use. He has been arrested once and convicted, which is a significant point because prior convictions can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 140 lbs. This doesn't seem directly related to risk assessment unless there's an issue with his weight or health, but there's no mention of that here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because it might lead to feelings of isolation, which could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Educational attainment isn't typically a direct risk factor unless he's not performing well academically, but there's no information on that here.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Having only one job might mean he relies on it heavily, which could lead to dependency issues if his income is unstable or if he struggles with work-life balance.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years and felt down for some of the past month. Drug use can be a strong indicator of potential substance abuse problems, which often correlates with higher risk of other criminal behaviors or health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area. This could indicate family stability but might also suggest exposure to certain environments that could influence behavior later on.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal life. While religious beliefs can be protective against some negative behaviors, they don't necessarily mitigate all risks, especially if other factors are problematic.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest and conviction increase risk. Drug use is a red flag. He's living alone without a spouse, which might lead to isolation. His job situation could mean financial instability or stress. His young age in an urban environment might have had exposure to negative influences. However, he has a diploma and is studying, which are positive steps.\n\nI think the factors lean towards high risk because of the arrest, drug use, living alone, and potential stress from work or family issues. The presence of these multiple indicators suggests that despite some protective factors like education and religion, the overall risk is elevated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 1 job during the year.
