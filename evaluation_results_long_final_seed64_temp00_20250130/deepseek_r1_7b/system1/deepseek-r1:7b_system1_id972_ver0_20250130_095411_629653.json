    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old White female. Age is quite young, which might not be directly indicative of high risk unless there are other factors. Her race doesn't immediately suggest anything without more context.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's a bit concerning because even though she's not convicted, it shows some interaction with the legal system. However, one arrest isn't typically enough to label someone as high risk.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 10 inches and her weight is between 150-174 lbs. That's within a normal BMI range for her age, so she doesn't appear to be underweight or overweight, which might not contribute to risk.\n\nShe's living alone, never married, and currently unenrolled from college. Living alone can sometimes indicate independence, but it could also mean she's managing without support, which isn't inherently risky unless there are other issues like substance use or mental health problems.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. This suggests she might be facing educational barriers, possibly leading to lower life outcomes if not addressed. Educational attainment is often linked with better opportunities and lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience can be positive as it shows ability to support herself, but only two jobs in a year isn't much, so maybe she's underemployed or struggling financially.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression over the past month. These are positive indicators of stability and health, which reduce risk factors.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. That might suggest she has some support system, but it's also possible that living with multiple family members could lead to dependency issues if there's no clear guidance or structure.\n\nHer belief that God doesn't affect her personal life is interesting. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be a risk factor as people often rely on religion for emotional support and guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, no convictions, normal BMI, living alone, no high school diploma, two jobs (possibly unstable), no drug use, recent mental health positive, but some negatives like age being young without much life experience. The lack of a strong support system due to living with four family members and her belief in God might be concerning.\n\nI think the factors that lean towards low risk are the absence of substance abuse and positive mental health. However, the other factors don't strongly indicate high risk either. Maybe she's at moderate risk because of her educational background and living situation without clear support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
