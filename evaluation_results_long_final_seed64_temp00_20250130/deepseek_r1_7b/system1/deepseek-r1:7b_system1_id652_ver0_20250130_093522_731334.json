    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is typically not a strong indicator of risk unless there are other factors like criminal history or substance use. He has been arrested once but not convicted. That might suggest some prior issues, but since it's not a conviction, maybe the impact is less severe.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150-174 lbs. This makes him lean towards being overweight, which can be associated with higher risk for certain health issues that might contribute to substance use or other behaviors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behavior, but it depends on the circumstances. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college, so maybe he's looking for more opportunities or facing challenges in his current situation.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience might indicate stability, which could be a positive sign against risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically mentioned some of the time during the past month he felt down and couldn't cheer himself up. This suggests recent substance use, which can be a red flag for potential behavioral issues or mental health concerns.\n\nHis feelings about God indicate that he doesn't believe in a higher power. This might influence his personal motivations and could potentially lead to risky behaviors if not monitored, but it's subjective.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area. That's a large family living together, which can sometimes be associated with different dynamics that might contribute to risk factors like substance abuse or neglect.\n\nConsidering all these points, there are some concerning indicators like prior arrest (even if not convicted), recent drug use affecting mood, and living in a large household without parents. These could increase the likelihood of risky behaviors. However, since he's only been arrested once and has some work experience, it might balance out to a lower risk but still on the higher side.\n\nI think overall, considering all these factors together, this individual should be classified as high risk with a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
