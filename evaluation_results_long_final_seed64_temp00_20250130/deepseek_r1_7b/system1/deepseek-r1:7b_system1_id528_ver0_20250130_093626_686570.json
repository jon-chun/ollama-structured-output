    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male Hispanic. Age is quite young, but being Hispanic doesn't directly correlate with higher risk unless there's a specific statistic involved, which isn't provided here. So maybe that's not a strong indicator.\n\nHe has been arrested five times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each arrest can increase the risk assessment score because it shows criminal history, which is usually a bad sign for reoffending.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 5 inches and weight between 150-174 lbs. This might be relevant if we're considering body mass or other health factors, but since there's no info on BMI or related health issues, I can't assess this directly.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living situation alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors like instability in the home environment, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing high school might be associated with lower educational attainment, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, but it's not always a direct indicator without more context.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Employment history is important; having no job or just one job for a short period could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining sobriety if he's involved in drug use.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, can be a risk factor depending on other factors like substance abuse patterns. Not feeling depressed might suggest he's managing his mental health, but it's not conclusive.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of five in an urban area. Young age and living with multiple family members could indicate potential challenges at home or social isolation, which can be risk factors for various issues, including criminal behavior.\n\nLastly, he believes in God. Religious affiliation is generally protective unless there's evidence of spiritual abuse or other negative influences from his faith.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are a big red flag (five times), living alone with no job and only one job might indicate instability, and past drug use adds to the risk factors. The rest don't seem as significant. So overall, this person likely has a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
