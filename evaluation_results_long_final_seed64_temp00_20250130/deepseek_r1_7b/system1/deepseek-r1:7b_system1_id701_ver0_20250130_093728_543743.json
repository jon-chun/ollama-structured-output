    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 20-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which might be a minor factor but not significant on its own. She has one arrest and no conviction, so that's a cautionary past but not severe enough yet.\n\nHer height is 5'7\" and weight between 150-174 lbs. That's within the normal range for her age, so no issues there.\n\nShe's single and living alone; that's common among young adults, so maybe not a strong indicator of risk.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college\u2014again, typical for someone her age. She's worked four jobs, which shows some stability despite being young.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That's interesting because drug use can sometimes correlate with mental health issues, but since she's not feeling depressed now, it might indicate she's managing it well.\n\nShe lived with both parents at a young age in a rural household of five. That could mean she experienced a lot of stress or neglect as a child, which is a red flag for potential behavioral issues later on.\n\nHer religious affiliation suggests she doesn't seek support from God, which might affect her coping mechanisms and relationships, possibly leading to isolation.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, living alone, no criminal history beyond an arrest. Her drug use isn't severe, but her past home environment could be problematic. She's young, so maybe not a high risk yet, but there are some concerning factors that might indicate moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
