    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a consideration in risk assessment because younger individuals might be more prone to making impulsive decisions or facing challenges that could lead to further issues. Being White doesn't directly indicate high risk unless there are systemic factors at play, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can still pose a risk, especially if it's related to serious offenses like violent crimes or drug offenses. However, since he hasn't been convicted, maybe the underlying offense wasn't severe enough to indicate high risk yet.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and weight 230 lbs. This makes him quite heavy for his height, which could be a sign of being underweight or having health issues that might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of isolation, which he mentions hasn't made him depressed in the past month. However, it also means he has limited support network, which could increase his risk of engaging in risky behaviors without proper guidance.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing high school or not pursuing further education can sometimes be linked to lower self-esteem or lack of motivation, potentially leading him towards risky choices like substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Having a stable job is important for financial stability and providing a sense of purpose. If he's unemployed or underemployed, it might contribute to his risk factors.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a significant risk factor, especially if it's leading him towards other risky behaviors like alcohol abuse or involvement in illegal activities.\n\nHe lived with non-biological parents in a household of two in a rural area at a young age. Growing up in such an environment might have contributed to behavioral issues or substance use problems later on.\n\nLastly, he believes in God and thinks it affects his personal outcomes. While religious beliefs can influence behavior, they don't necessarily predict risk unless there's evidence of problematic behavior influenced by those beliefs.\n\nPutting all these together: a single arrest without conviction, living alone, substance use (marijuana), and factors like not completing high school or being 18 could indicate moderate to high risk. The presence of a GED might suggest some level of education but also independence from formal schooling which can sometimes be linked to risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards a high risk with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
