    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age is often a consideration in risk assessment; younger individuals might be more prone to making impulsive decisions. Her race could also play into stereotypes that might affect her risk perception, though I should be cautious about generalizations.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Re-arrest rates can sometimes indicate underlying issues, so two arrests without a conviction might suggest she's facing some challenges but hasn't yet hit rock bottom.\n\nHer height and weight don't immediately seem relevant to risk assessment unless there are health concerns associated with them, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone is a factor; living in a single unit can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to isolation or lack of support network. However, it's not the most significant indicator on its own.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates when she has access to resources. Not having a degree might mean she's struggling with life skills or facing barriers that impede her ability to reintegrate positively.\n\nShe's held five jobs during the year, which could indicate some level of stability if she's been able to find work despite challenges. However, the number of jobs doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are issues like unstable employment history.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Drug use can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and potentially lead to more risky situations or substance abuse disorders which could affect her ability to make responsible decisions.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but past depression could be a risk factor if it's untreated. However, recent lack of depression might suggest she's managing her mental health better than in the past.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in a household of five in a rural area suggests she had a complex family environment. While this can have both positive and negative aspects, living in such a large household could indicate social support but also potential neglect if not properly supervised.\n\nConsidering that God has something to do with her personal events might suggest she has some level of spirituality or faith influencing her life choices, which could be either protective or a source of stress depending on the context.\n\nPutting this all together: two arrests without convictions, no high school diploma, living alone, drug use history, and a complex family background. These factors collectively point towards a moderate to high risk. The recidivism rate for individuals with these characteristics might place her in the high-risk category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
