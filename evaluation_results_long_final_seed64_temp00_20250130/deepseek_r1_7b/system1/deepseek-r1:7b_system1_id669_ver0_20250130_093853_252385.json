    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female of mixed race. Mixed race doesn't inherently make someone more or less risky, but it's something to note. She has been arrested five times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; each arrest can increase the risk level.\n\nShe is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Weight in this range could be associated with being sedentary or having health issues, but without more info on BMI or related health problems, it's hard to say. Maybe she's at a healthy weight for her height.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to isolation, which might increase the risk of substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Not continuing education could mean she lacks skills that might help with job opportunities or making better life choices.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness is often linked to higher recidivism rates because it can lead to dependency on substance abuse, welfare, etc., which are known risk factors.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a strong indicator of potential for further substance abuse issues, which can contribute to criminal behavior or other risky activities.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While some drug use might be linked with depression symptoms, not feeling depressed now doesn't necessarily negate past issues. It's possible she's using drugs to cope with something else.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of five with her adoptive parents in a rural area. Small households can sometimes lead to higher dependency on family support, which might decrease risk if the family is stable. However, living in a rural area could mean less access to resources or support networks that might help prevent risky behavior.\n\nShe believes that God has nothing to do with her personal life. This lack of religious involvement might affect her decision-making and relationships, potentially increasing risk factors like substance abuse or neglecting family responsibilities if she's living alone.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior arrests, drug use, living alone, no job, high school diploma only\u2014these are all red flags that suggest a high risk. The lack of religious involvement might add to her isolation and potential for risky behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
