    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might be more prone to reoffending. Being White doesn't directly correlate with higher risk unless there are systemic issues at play, which I don't have information on here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can still indicate some level of criminal history tendency, though it's not a clear indicator of high risk. It might suggest he's aware of the legal system or has had some interaction with law enforcement before.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 9 inches and 185 lbs. These aren't typical risk factors unless there's an associated health issue, but since no health problems are mentioned, I don't think these contribute to risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor as it reduces the likelihood of domestic violence or other family-related issues. Since he's single and not cohabiting, maybe this isn't a red flag.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence future criminal behavior; having a diploma might suggest some level of responsibility, but not being in school could mean he's looking for work or further education, which is positive.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment history is generally protective as it shows ability to contribute and maintain stability. One job isn't necessarily bad unless there were issues with it, but nothing suggests that here.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors or substance abuse, which might increase risk of other crimes or health issues. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe this isn't a significant factor.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month is interesting. While depression can be a risk factor for certain crimes, not experiencing it could indicate better mental health, which is protective rather than indicative of high risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four. This suggests a stable early life environment, which is generally associated with lower risk of criminal behavior. Larger households can sometimes correlate with more support and less stress.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support system, but without knowing how he integrates spirituality or other beliefs, it's hard to assess. However, if this is a strong belief, it might reduce the influence of community or family dynamics related to religion in his life.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest, no prior conviction, living alone, stable environment, positive education and employment history, moderate drug use (marijuana), and no recent depression. These factors don't strongly indicate high risk but also aren't clear indicators of low risk either. The single arrest is a slight concern, but without more information on past behavior or other risk factors like substance abuse beyond marijuana, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nI might lean towards \"NO\" with lower confidence because the factors are mixed and don't strongly suggest high risk. However, considering he has one prior arrest, which could indicate some criminal tendencies, maybe there's a slight risk. But since he's 18 and not yet convicted, it's probably better to err on the side of caution but not too high.\n\nSo, I'll assign \"NO\" with confidence around 30% because while there are some indicators that might suggest low risk, the single arrest is a point in the right direction without being conclusive.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
