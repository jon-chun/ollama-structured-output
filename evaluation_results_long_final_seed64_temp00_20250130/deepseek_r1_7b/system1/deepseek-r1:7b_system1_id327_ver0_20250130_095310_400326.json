    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female of Black heritage. Her race can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates in some studies, but that might not always hold true and depends on other factors.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without a conviction is significant because it shows she's been tried before, which could indicate potential for future issues.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 0 inches and weight 140 lbs. This doesn't immediately raise red flags unless combined with other factors like behavior or health issues, but alone, it's neutral.\n\nShe's never married and isn't living alone. Living situation can sometimes be a indicator of stability, though without more context on the nature of her living arrangements, it's hard to say.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked with higher risk of involvement in the criminal system due to lack of skills and opportunities.\n\nShe has held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can be positive as it shows adaptability and responsibility, but if she's been unemployed for long periods, that could be a concern.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse is a strong risk factor as it can impair judgment, relationships, and ability to function effectively.\n\nHer recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors, which are also significant risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in a household of ten in an urban area. This suggests she was raised in a multi-parent environment but in a large family, which could have its own set of challenges and potential protective factors depending on the dynamics.\n\nHer belief in God indicates a religious background, which can be protective against certain types of criminal behavior but might not directly correlate with risk if she's functioning well otherwise.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history, lack of education, drug use, and recent emotional low points are strong indicators. While her living situation is noted, without more context on the stability or nature of those arrangements, it's hard to fully assess that aspect. However, considering all factors, she does present a high risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 10, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
