    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his early twenties is generally considered low risk compared to older individuals who might have more life experience and potential for substance abuse or criminal behavior. Being White doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are systemic issues, but that's probably beyond the scope here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can sometimes be mitigating because it shows he hasn't fully committed to any prior offense. However, it's important to consider if this was for a serious offense or something minor. Since it's not specified, I'll assume it's a non-serious offense.\n\nHe is 6 feet tall and weighs 185 lbs. That's a pretty standard build; nothing jumps out as exceptionally high or low in terms of body type that would directly correlate with risk without additional context like weight relative to height for BMI or muscle mass.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be both protective (less social support) but also potentially risky if there are underlying issues. However, since he doesn't have any known issues mentioned here, this might not be a significant risk factor on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is generally associated with lower recidivism rates when higher education is attainable. Not being enrolled could mean he's facing barriers to further education or training programs which might contribute to low risk, but again, without knowing his circumstances, it's hard to say.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment history can be positive as having a steady job usually indicates stability and self-sufficiency. However, if that job was unstable or he had trouble finding work in the past, it could indicate other issues. Since only one job is mentioned, I'll assume it's stable.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use can be a significant risk factor for various behaviors including criminal activity. The fact that he hasn't used drugs for four years suggests he might be clean and therefore lower risk regarding drug-related issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression is a serious mental health issue that could impact behavior, but since he's not experiencing it now, this is a positive sign. However, past history or other mental health conditions aren't mentioned here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area. This indicates he was raised in a multi-parent household in a city. Urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates and different social dynamics, but without knowing if there were any issues or stressors from that environment, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. This is a strong indicator of religious involvement, which is generally associated with lower risk behaviors compared to those who don't have such beliefs. Religious individuals often engage in prosocial behaviors and may be more likely to seek help when needed.\n\nPutting all these together: No prior convictions, stable living situation (living alone), no drug use, positive mental health indicators, and religious involvement are all mitigating factors that suggest low risk. The single arrest might be a point of concern if it's for a serious offense, but without more context, I'll assume it's minor.\n\nTherefore, the overall risk is probably low to moderate. However, considering he has one prior arrest, which could indicate some underlying issues or potential for future behavior, maybe leaning towards low confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
