    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often considered in risk assessment because younger individuals might be more prone to certain behaviors or have different life experiences compared to older adults. However, age alone doesn't usually indicate high risk unless there are other factors involved.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. Conviction history can indicate past behavior that may pose risks in the future. Even if he's young, having a criminal record can be a red flag for recidivism.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and he weighs 185 lbs. I don't see how physical characteristics like height or weight directly relate to risk unless it's linked to other factors like substance use or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because individuals who live alone might have fewer social support networks, which could contribute to higher levels of stress or substance use. However, this isn't as strong without additional context about his mental health or other living arrangements.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level can influence risk factors. Higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and financial stability, which might reduce risk. However, it's not always directly linked to criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like academic problems.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can indicate good financial stability or perhaps a desire for self-sufficiency, which could be positive but doesn't necessarily correlate with high risk without more context on job type or stability.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive indicators as they suggest no recent substance abuse or mental health issues that could contribute to risk behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 4. This indicates he was raised in an environment without biological parents, which can sometimes be associated with higher levels of stress, anxiety, or potential substance use issues. However, this alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This is a strong indicator of religious involvement and typically correlates with lower risk behaviors as it suggests a sense of moral responsibility and adherence to values.\n\nPutting all these together: He has a criminal history, which is a strong red flag. His living situation might contribute to stress or other issues, but without more context on those areas, it's hard to assess fully. His positive mental health indicators are present, but his past criminal record significantly raises the risk. The presence of any substance abuse or mental health issues would be critical factors, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nConsidering all these points, while there are some mitigating factors like positive mental health and education, the primary factor is his prior conviction. This suggests a moderate to high risk because of past criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
