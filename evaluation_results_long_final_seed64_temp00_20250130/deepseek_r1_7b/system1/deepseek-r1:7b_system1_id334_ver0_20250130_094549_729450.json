    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is usually not a strong indicator of risk unless it's significantly higher or younger than typical offenders, but at 21, he's still relatively young and in his prime years for being an offender.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two prior convictions, which does suggest some criminal history, but I need to consider the nature of those convictions. If they were minor offenses or more serious ones, it could vary. Since it's not specified, I'll assume they are non-felony convictions.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 4 inches and 190 lbs. While height can sometimes be associated with certain behaviors, there's no direct link to risk without additional context like body type or prior behavior related to size.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there are other factors like substance use or instability, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; sometimes higher education correlates with lower recidivism rates, but it's not always the case. Not being enrolled might suggest he's seeking help, which could be positive.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs usually indicates stability and self-sufficiency, which are generally protective factors against reoffending.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to substance abuse disorders that might affect judgment or behavior. However, since he's not feeling depressed now, it might indicate he's managed it well.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite living alone and potentially facing stress from his situation. Managing mental health issues without showing signs of depression could be a positive sign.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a larger household might suggest exposure to various influences, but it's not directly linked to criminal behavior unless there are other factors like family dysfunction or lack of supervision.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with prosocial behaviors, though they don't guarantee good outcomes.\n\nPutting this all together: The key risk factors here would be the prior convictions and any associated issues like drug use that could impact judgment or behavior. Since he's young, doesn't have a family history of crime, and seems to manage his substance use without severe mental health issues, it might not be a high risk. However, two prior convictions do suggest some risk potential.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some red flags like prior convictions and possible drug use, he's managing other aspects well. So maybe around 30% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
