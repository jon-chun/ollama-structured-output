He has a criminal history with three arrests and two convictions. That's already a red flag because recidivism is more common in people with a history of being in custody.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 235 lbs, which makes me think about his health. He hasn't used drugs for four years, so that's positive. But he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which could mean he has less access to opportunities or support systems. Plus, he's not enrolled in college, so maybe he's struggling with education.\n\nHe's living alone, which might contribute to feelings of isolation and stress. He's never been married, so there's no one to provide emotional support during a potential relapse. His lack of employment could also be a risk factor because having a stable job can help prevent substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\n\nHis past living situation is concerning\u2014he was in a household of ten at a young age in an urban area. That kind of environment might have contributed to his criminal behavior, and it's not something that gets better with time. He also mentions considering God as part of his life, which could be positive for moral guidance but doesn't directly relate to substance use.\n\nPutting all this together, the factors like prior convictions, lack of education, living alone, and unstable family background all point towards a higher risk. I'm leaning towards high risk because he has multiple past issues that can predict future behavior. His low educational attainment might make him more susceptible to making bad decisions again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of criminal behavior with three arrests and two convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities for positive change and could contribute to substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Not being enrolled in college and not holding a job suggests limited support system and potential lack of stability, which can increase risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a family support network may lead to feelings of isolation and stress, potentially contributing to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates positive behavior trends that could reduce recidivism risk over time.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"high\", \"Exposure to a harsh environment at a young age increases vulnerability to criminal behavior and potential for continued problematic patterns.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
