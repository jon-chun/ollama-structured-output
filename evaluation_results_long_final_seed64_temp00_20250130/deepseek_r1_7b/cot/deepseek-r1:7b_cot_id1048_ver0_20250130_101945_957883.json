    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested six times and convicted. That's a lot; multiple convictions are usually strong indicators of recidivism. Each prior offense can increase the chances of reoffending because he might have learned nothing from past mistakes or could be motivated again.\n\nHe's Hispanic, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some systemic issue, which isn't indicated. So maybe this doesn't add much weight.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'5\" and 145 lbs. That's on the lower end for his age, but not necessarily an indicator of behavior. Maybe he's in school, so being underweight might be a sign of something else, but I don't have enough info to link it directly.\n\nLiving alone is a risk factor because isolation can lead to emotional issues or substance abuse, which are linked to recidivism.\n\nHe's not married and living alone\u2014so no support network. That could mean he's dealing with his own problems without help, increasing the chance of using drugs or engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nNot working during the year might mean he's relying on school or other activities for structure. Without income, maybe he's more susceptible to substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana and cocaine over four years is significant. Drug use can impair judgment, lead to impulsive behavior, and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky situations again.\n\nHe felt down for much of the past month; perhaps this is related to drug use or other stressors. Emotional distress without support could lead to substance abuse or self-harm, both linked to recidivism.\n\nYoung age at first offense\u2014maybe he's impulsive or lacks life experience. But since he has multiple convictions, that might negate some of the younger risk factors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area\u2014could indicate exposure to family dynamics or environment that might influence behavior, but it's not directly tied to recidivism unless there are specific issues like neglect or abuse.\n\nBelieving God has no role in his life could mean he's more likely to engage in self-destructive behaviors without guidance, which increases risk.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple prior convictions (high), drug use (high), emotional distress (high), living alone (medium?), lack of support (high), and young age with a history of substance abuse. The factors point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple prior convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a significant criminal history, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse can impair judgment and lead to impulsive behavior, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Emotional distress without support\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for much of the month could be linked to substance use or stressors, both risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living in isolation may contribute to emotional issues but does not directly correlate as strongly with recidivism compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"No job during the year\", \"high\", \"Lack of income can lead to risky situations such as drug use or neglect, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years and recent distress\", \"high\", \"Persistent substance use and emotional distress are strong indicators of potential relapse.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment.
