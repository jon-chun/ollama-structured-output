    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black male. He's been arrested 10 times and convicted, which is a lot of convictions\u2014definitely high risk because prior convictions are strongly predictive of future crimes.\n\nHe's 6'11\" and weighs 165 lbs. His height might not directly affect his risk unless there's something about his behavior related to that, but I don't think so. So maybe medium weight for this factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence his stability; being single and living alone might mean he has fewer support systems which could lead to higher recidivism. So perhaps a medium or high risk here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important because education, especially at the high school level, correlates with lower recidivism. Not being educated and not going back to school might indicate he's less likely to get an education that helps him avoid trouble\u2014so maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe hasn't held a job during the year. Joblessness can be a red flag because it might mean he doesn't have skills or income to support himself, increasing the chance of engaging in risky behavior again. So this factor would probably contribute to higher risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning, especially if it's recent, as it can impair judgment and lead to impulsive behaviors. However, since he hasn't felt depressed lately, maybe the impact isn't as high\u2014so perhaps medium or low.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such a setting might have had both positive and negative influences. Urban environments can sometimes be more conducive to crime if there's higher population density, but without knowing the broader context, it's hard to say. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can influence behavior; some might make better decisions based on faith, but others might struggle. It's a bit ambiguous here\u2014maybe low or medium risk depending on how he applies that belief.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are the highest risk factor here. Then living situation and joblessness come next. Education level is protective, so maybe mitigates some of the risk. Drug use is concerning but recent lack of depression might reduce its impact. The urban household could be a bit mixed in terms of influence.\n\nSo overall, considering all these factors, I think his risk is high because of the multiple strong negative indicators like prior convictions, living alone, no job, and drug use. The positive factors (education) don't outweigh the negatives enough to bring it down to medium or low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"High risk due to multiple prior convictions which are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married may indicate a lack of support systems, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"joblessness\", \"high\", \"Not holding a job can lead to financial instability and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may limit opportunities for positive development and deterrence against crime.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially recent marijuana use but without recent feelings of depression, could still pose a moderate risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
