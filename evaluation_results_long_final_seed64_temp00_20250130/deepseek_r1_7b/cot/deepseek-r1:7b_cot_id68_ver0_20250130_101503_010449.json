    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. That's relatively young, but she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. Young adults can sometimes have recidivism issues because they're still developing, so that might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. I know there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but since she's been convicted once, maybe her race isn't adding much to the risk here unless there's specific data indicating higher recidivism for White individuals, which I don't have right now.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'5\" and 130 lbs. That's on the lower end of average. Weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism studies, but without more info, it's hard to say how much this contributes. Maybe not a high risk here.\n\nLiving alone: She's currently living alone. Living with family or support networks usually reduces risk factors like substance abuse and lack of supervision. So maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED: She's 20 but hasn't completed basic education. Lack of education can lead to unstable situations, which might increase recidivism. That could be a medium risk because she's young and without education, it might affect her ability to find stable employment or support herself.\n\nNot enrolled in college: Similar to the previous point, not attending school might mean she doesn't have the skills needed for better opportunities. This is another medium risk factor.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs during the year. That's a good sign because having multiple jobs can provide financial stability and reduce stress. So this would be low risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with some recent use in the last month. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential future substance abuse issues, which can contribute to recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor because she's currently using drugs, which could lead to more substance-related problems.\n\nMental health: She felt down for much of the past month and says nothing can cheer her up. This might indicate depression or anxiety, both of which are serious mental health issues that can affect behavior and decision-making. High risk here.\n\nYouthful living situation at a young age with her biological mother in a household of three: Growing up in such a setting could have emotional challenges, possibly leading to behavioral issues later on. This might be a medium-high risk factor because family dynamics during early life can influence recidivism rates.\n\nNo involvement with God: Her religious affiliation is unclear, but not involving religion might mean she's dealing with other stressors or has different coping mechanisms. Not sure how this affects her risk; maybe it's low unless there's evidence that lack of spirituality increases recidivism, which I don't have information on.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Medium for criminal history.\n- Low for living alone and education.\n- High for drug use and mental health.\n- Medium for past family environment.\n- Low for employment status.\n\nThe high risk factors (drug use and mental health) seem to dominate. So the overall prediction is high risk, but maybe not extremely certain because she has some positive factors like being 20 and living alone. However, considering the recidivism studies I've seen before, drug use and mental health are significant predictors.\n\nSo my final assessment would be a high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 20, which is relatively young, but she has a criminal history that could influence her recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can play a role in the criminal justice system, there's no specific indication here of increased risk due to being White.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Her height and weight are within average ranges, but without specific data on how these factors influence recidivism, it's considered low.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can reduce risk factors like substance abuse and lack of supervision, making this a low risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She has not completed high school or GED, which could impact her ability to find stable employment, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Not enrolled in college and holding 3 jobs are positive factors that reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine, with recent use, significantly increases the risk of substance abuse issues leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for much of the past month indicates potential mental health issues, which can affect behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Youthful Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of three during a young age could have emotional challenges that might influence recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Not involving God doesn't provide specific information on how it affects recidivism risk, so it's considered low.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
