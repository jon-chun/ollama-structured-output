    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut. I know that these groups have higher recidivism rates compared to non-Indigenous people. So that's a high risk factor right there.\n\nShe has two arrests but no convictions. Having prior criminal history can increase the chance of rearrest, especially if it's non-convicted. So medium risk from that.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; she's 5'5\" and 140 lbs. No clue how that affects her.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse. Stability in home can reduce recidivism, so maybe low impact on risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism because it might limit opportunities for positive change. So medium to high risk.\n\nOnly one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency issues and higher chances of engaging in criminal activities again. Medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a significant issue. Substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism. High risk because drug use can impair judgment and increase impulsive behavior.\n\nRecent feelings of low mood for a month\u2014she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This might indicate underlying mental health issues or stressors, both of which are linked to higher recidivism rates. High risk factor due to possible mental health concerns.\n\nGrowing up in a household of three in a rural area at a young age. Small family environments can sometimes lead to emotional neglect if the mother isn't involved. This could contribute to behavioral issues and higher likelihood of reoffending. Medium-high risk because of potential neglect or environment stressors.\n\nBelieving in God has some positive aspects, but it's not directly linked to recidivism. However, her spirituality might influence her behavior indirectly, though this factor is probably low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior non-convicted arrests (medium), lack of education and job (medium-high), drug use (high), and growing up in a challenging environment (medium). The prior factors like substance abuse and family environment are strong indicators. So the overall risk is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Non-Convicted Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having two prior non-convicted arrests increases the likelihood of reoffending compared to those with no criminal history, though it's not as significant as a conviction.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education or GED can limit opportunities for positive change and may contribute to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine indicates potential substance abuse issues, which are strong predictors of reoffending due to impaired judgment and increased impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of low mood and lack of hope may signal underlying mental health concerns that could contribute to criminal behavior or risky decisions.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of three in a rural area at a young age might indicate potential neglect or emotional stress, which can influence behavioral patterns and increase the risk of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
