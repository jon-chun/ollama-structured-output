    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults are generally less likely to reoffend compared to older individuals who have had more time to reflect and change their behavior. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know there's some racial disparity in the criminal justice system, but since he's young and has only two prior convictions, his race might not significantly impact his risk here. Maybe medium risk because of potential systemic issues, but it's probably not the main driver.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. Two prior convictions are significant. Recidivism tends to increase with more past offenses. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they're just physical attributes without any direct connection to criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nNot being married and living alone... Unemployment rates among single individuals can be higher, which might lead to more substance use and other risky behaviors. That's medium risk because it's a contributing factor but not the most critical.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; those with less education are more likely to reoffend. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe held three jobs during the year. Unemployment or having multiple jobs can affect stability, but holding three jobs might indicate he's somewhat stable and employed enough to avoid criminal activities. Maybe medium risk here because job stability usually reduces recidivism.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can lead to unstable behavior, legal issues, and other risky situations. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can sometimes be linked to substance abuse or other issues that might contribute to criminal behavior. Not feeling depressed could be positive, but if he's been using drugs, maybe there are underlying mental health issues. So medium risk because it's somewhat relevant but not directly tied to recidivism.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such a large household might have had negative effects like limited supervision or exposure to crime, which could increase the risk. That's a medium-high risk factor because family environment can influence behavior.\n\nConsidering that he believes God has some role in his life, this is more of a personal belief and less about his criminal tendencies. So probably low risk from this perspective.\n\nPutting it all together: two prior convictions (high), drug use (high), lack of education (high). The rest are medium or low. So the overall prediction would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults generally have lower recidivism rates due to time for reflection and change in behavior.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Potential systemic issues, though not the main driver here given his age and limited prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior convictions significantly increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and having held three jobs may indicate some stability but isn't a mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Less education is associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past drug use can lead to unstable behavior and increased risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household could have had negative influences but isn't the primary factor here.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed might be positive, but drug use could indicate underlying issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
