    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested three times before. That's a solid indicator of past criminal behavior, which usually means higher risk. So that's high risk right there.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there are systemic issues, which aren't mentioned. So maybe medium weight.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'2\" and 145 lbs. That doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of physical characteristics related to recidivism. Maybe low risk for this factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since he's not in a relationship or with family nearby, maybe medium risk because isolation could contribute to issues.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school: Education is usually protective against recidivism, so that might be low risk.\n\nNo job in the past year: Unemployment can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors. So that's medium risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself is concerning, especially if it's recent, but since he's not experiencing depression now, maybe a bit lower risk than someone with ongoing issues. Medium?\n\nYoung household size at five members when young: A larger household might provide more support, so that could be protective against recidivism. Maybe low.\n\nBelieves in God: Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but without knowing if it's actively affecting his actions now, maybe medium risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the arrest history is a big red flag (high), drug use (medium), and living situation (medium). The rest are either protective or neutral. So overall, I'd lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of three arrests, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and increased likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"While the individual has used drugs in the past four years, there have been no recent episodes of depression, suggesting that current drug use may not be as concerning as ongoing issues could imply.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a partner or close family support might contribute to isolation and potential risky behaviors but does not indicate a direct link to recidivism in this case.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school, which is generally protective against recidivism as education can provide positive life skills and opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"No job held in the past year could be concerning but does not directly correlate with high risk without additional context about potential substance abuse or other issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
