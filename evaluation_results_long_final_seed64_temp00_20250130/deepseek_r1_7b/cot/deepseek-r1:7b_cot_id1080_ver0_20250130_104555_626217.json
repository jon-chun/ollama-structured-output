    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearrest within three years. He's Black, has two prior arrests and convictions, is 6'4\" and weighs 210 lbs. He's living alone, not married, with a high school diploma but enrolled in college. He worked one job last year, used marijuana in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed recently. His early life was tough\u2014he lived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area when he was young. He believes God plays a role in his life.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor step by step.\n\n1. **Age and Education**: He's 21, which is relatively young for reoffending. He has a high school diploma but is still enrolled in college. Education can sometimes help with job opportunities and betterment, so maybe this isn't a strong risk factor. But since he's still studying, it might indicate he's motivated.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent or frequent use, is a significant risk factor for reoffending because it can lead to strained relationships, substance abuse issues, and impulsive behavior.\n\n3. **Living Situation**: He's living alone, which might suggest he's managing his environment well. However, being in an urban area with a large household could indicate instability or neglect, which isn't directly related but might be part of the socioeconomic factors affecting him.\n\n4. **Previous Arrests and Convictions**: Two prior arrests and convictions are concerning. Each arrest can increase the risk of reoffending due to recidivism theory\u2014previous convictions make it harder to reintegrate into society and may lead to more criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Personal Beliefs and Environment**: He believes in God, which might provide some stability or moral guidance. However, his early life was harsh\u2014he lived with seven people when he was young, which could indicate family dysfunction or neglect, contributing to his risk profile.\n\nPutting it all together: The two prior arrests are a strong indicator of high risk. Drug use is another significant factor. His living situation might not directly contribute but could be part of a broader socioeconomic issue affecting him. Education-wise, being in college and working might mitigate some risks, but the recidivism theory suggests that past behavior is a better predictor than current circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014two prior convictions, drug use, and his age\u2014the risk seems high. The presence of two prior arrests alone would push towards a high risk prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of criminal behavior which increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can lead to strained relationships and impulsive behavior that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and_education\", \"low\", \"Despite being 21 years old and enrolled in college, his education level might not directly correlate with immediate risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently indicate a high risk but may suggest self-reliance which could mitigate some risks.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"medium\", \"Exposure to a harsh early life, including living with multiple family members in an urban area, can contribute to behavioral issues and increased risk of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
