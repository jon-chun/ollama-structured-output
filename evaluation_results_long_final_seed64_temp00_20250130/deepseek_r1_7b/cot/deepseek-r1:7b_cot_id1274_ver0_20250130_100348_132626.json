    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested twice but not convicted, which is a minor offense history. His weight and height don't seem directly relevant here; maybe his size could indicate something about his lifestyle or substance use, but he's already mentioned using marijuana.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone, so he might be in a relationship or with family. His education level is high school diploma, which is average, but he's attending college now. That could mean he's motivated to change his situation, maybe through academics or personal growth.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year, which shows some work experience and adaptability. However, since he's not convicted of any serious crimes, maybe his job performance isn't directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use in the past four years is a red flag. Substance abuse can lead to other issues like mental health problems or family dysfunction. He mentioned not feeling depressed recently, which might suggest he's managing it, but that could also mean he's avoiding deeper issues.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his adoptive parents in an urban area at a young age probably exposed him to a lot of stress and instability. That environment can have long-term effects on his behavior and mental health.\n\nHis religious belief might influence his decision-making, but I'm not sure how that ties into recidivism risk directly unless it affects his willingness to seek help or change.\n\nPutting this all together: Minor offense history, stable living situation (not alone), some work experience, drug use in the past, growing up in a stressful home. The factors that could increase risk are the drug use and the unstable early life. The minor offenses might not be enough to tip him over. So maybe his risk is medium.\n\nI think I'll assign Medium risk because of the drug use and family background, but he's young and has some positive factors like education and job experience.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"minor offense history\", \"low\", \"The individual has only two arrests without convictions, which is a minor offense history.
