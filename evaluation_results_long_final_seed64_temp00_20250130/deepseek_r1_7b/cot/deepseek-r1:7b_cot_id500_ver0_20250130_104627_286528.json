    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old Black female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's high risk right there.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 130 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor in recidivism unless it's related to substance use, which she has some history of.\n\nLiving alone is interesting. Some studies suggest living with family can provide support, but if she's been in trouble before, maybe she doesn't have the same level of support now. I'm not sure how much that affects her risk compared to others without a support network.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe she's looking for more education or a better job, which could help reduce recidivism if she gets involved again. But it also means she might be motivated to change her behavior.\n\nOnly one job during the year is a bit concerning because having stable employment can prevent financial stress that leads to substance abuse or other issues. So maybe this isn't as high of a risk factor, but still something to consider.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates, especially if it's leading to other problems like debt or family issues. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which might be a positive sign, but substance use can also lead to depression over time.\n\nHer early life was tough living with her biological mother in a household of nine in a rural area. That kind of environment can have long-term effects on mental health and substance use, both of which are risk factors for recidivism. Plus, she mentions God has some influence, which might suggest she's seeking help but could also indicate other underlying issues.\n\nConsidering all these points: prior arrest, drug use, living situation, education level, job status, and early trauma. It seems like a high risk overall because of the multiple factors pointing towards potential relapse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending due to established criminal behavior and possible underlying issues such as substance abuse or unstable family environment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Substance use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor for recidivism.
