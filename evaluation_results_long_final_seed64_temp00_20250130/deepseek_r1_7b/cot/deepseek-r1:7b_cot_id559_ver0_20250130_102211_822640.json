    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with three convictions. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 215 lbs. I don't know if his weight is relevant here unless it affects his ability to perform certain jobs, but since he's got a high school diploma and isn't in college, maybe he has stable employment. Not sure how much this impacts risk.\n\nHe's living alone, which can sometimes be a protective factor because he might not have the same level of supervision as someone living with multiple people. But it also depends on his support network elsewhere.\n\nHis drug use history is only from the past four years, specifically marijuana. That's less severe than say, cocaine or harder drugs, but still indicates some substance use issues which can affect behavior and decision-making.\n\nHe felt down for most of the past month. This could be a sign of mental health issues like depression, which can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors. It might also suggest he needs help, which could lower his risk if he's proactive about treatment.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of seven. That was probably chaotic and could have had a significant impact on his behavior and social skills. A larger household might not necessarily be protective but can contribute to other risk factors like unstable family environment or lack of supervision.\n\nHe believes in God, which is a strong moral compass. This could actually lower his risk because having a clear moral framework often leads to more responsible behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: His prior convictions are the highest risk factor here. The other factors don't necessarily outweigh that unless there's something else really bad. So I'd lean towards high risk but maybe not extremely certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of three arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"While limited to marijuana in the past four years, drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for most of the month may indicate underlying mental health issues that could affect behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk but depends on support networks; however, it is not a mitigating factor in this case.\"),\n    (\"Chaotic Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing living with seven family members may contribute to behavioral issues or instability, which could be a risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
