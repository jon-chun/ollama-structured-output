    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even if she's not getting convictions, it could mean she's still struggling with her criminal behavior. So that's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's Hispanic, which isn't directly a risk factor, but sometimes minority groups have different recidivism rates, so maybe I should note that as something to consider, perhaps a low impact here.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant unless there's some health indicator, but since she's not using drugs now, maybe it's just about her current state. So probably no factor from that.\n\nShe's living alone, which can be isolating. Social support is important for preventing recidivism, so living alone might increase the risk a bit\u2014maybe medium.\n\nNo college enrollment and never married could mean she's not seeking help or building a stable life. That's another medium risk factor because lack of education and marital stability are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs recently, which is concerning because employment can reduce recidivism by providing purpose and reducing stress. So no job is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHer drug use history is clean for the past four years, so that's good\u2014no immediate risk from substance abuse. But her mood has been really low lately; she says nothing cheers her up. That could be related to depression or anxiety, which are linked to higher recidivism rates. So maybe a high risk factor here.\n\nShe was raised in a household of five with both parents when young, especially in an urban area. That's a tough upbringing\u2014family stress can contribute to criminal behavior and higher recidivism. High risk factor.\n\nLastly, she believes in God but feels disconnected sometimes. While spirituality can help, feelings of isolation might be contributing to her issues. Maybe medium here.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium for each of the first factors (arrests, living alone, no job), high for mood and depression, high for family background. So overall prediction is YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested three times but not convicted, which may indicate ongoing struggles with criminal behavior that could lead to future arrests and convictions.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can contribute to feelings of isolation and stress, potentially increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Job status\", \"high\", \"Not holding a job during the past year is concerning as employment can reduce stress and provide purpose, which may decrease recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mood and depression\", \"high\", \"Her recent low mood and lack of cheer could indicate underlying mental health issues linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"high\", \"Living with both parents in a household of five in an urban area at a young age, especially during tough times, can contribute to family stress and potentially increase criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"medium\", \"While she believes in God, feelings of isolation may be contributing to her personal struggles, which could influence recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
