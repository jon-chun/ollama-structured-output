    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male from being rearrested within three years. He's Asian/Pacific Islander, arrested five times but not convicted. His height is 5'9\", weighs 145 lbs, living alone, never married. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college. No job experience during the year. He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a two-person household in an urban area. He doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the factors and evaluate each one's impact on recidivism risk.\n\n1. **Number of Arrests**: He has five arrests but no convictions. Repeated arrests can indicate underlying issues that might not be resolved, increasing the chance of future offenses or reoffending.\n\n2. **Demographics**: Age 18 is still considered a juvenile, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates as they enter adulthood without proper support systems.\n\n3. **Ethnicity**: Being Asian/Pacific Islander isn't directly linked to higher crime rates but might be associated with certain risk factors if not properly addressed.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can impair judgment, reduce self-control, and increase impulsive behavior, all of which are risk factors for recidivism.\n\n5. **Living Situation**: Living alone at 18 is a red flag. Being an only child or living independently without support can lead to isolation and increased vulnerability to stressors that might push him back into criminal behavior.\n\n6. **Marital Status**: Not being married could mean he's not in a stable environment, which might contribute to unstable relationships or substance abuse issues.\n\n7. **Education Level**: High school diploma but not college enrollment suggests he may lack the necessary skills for better opportunities and might struggle with re-entering society successfully.\n\n8. **Employment**: No job during the year means he has no steady income source, making it harder to support himself financially and reducing motivation to change his behavior.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs**: Not believing in God could affect his personal motivations and coping mechanisms for stress or failure, potentially leading to substance abuse as a coping strategy.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor points towards a high risk of rearrest. Repeated arrests without convictions, living alone, drug use, lack of education and employment opportunities, and unstable living situation all contribute significantly. The combination makes it highly likely he'll reoffend within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Repetitive Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of multiple arrests without convictions, which may indicate unresolved personal issues or behavioral patterns that could lead to future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Youth Age and Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone at an early age can contribute to isolation and increased vulnerability to environmental factors that may push him back into criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can impair judgment and self-control, increasing the risk of impulsive or risky behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No Job Experience\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment during the year reduces his ability to support himself financially and provides motivation to change his behavior, potentially leading to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Not believing in God may affect his coping mechanisms for stress or failure, possibly leading to substance abuse as a means of dealing with these challenges.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
