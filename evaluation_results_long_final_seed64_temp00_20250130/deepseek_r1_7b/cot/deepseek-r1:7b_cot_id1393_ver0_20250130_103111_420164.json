    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old Black female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even though it doesn't show a conviction, it does indicate some involvement with the system. I think that could be medium weight since it shows past interaction but no real consequence beyond arrest.\n\nShe's 5'10\" and weighs 165 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct risk factor unless there are health issues, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe low weight for this factor.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Being in a stable environment usually reduces risk, but if she's been through some trauma, living alone might not be the safest option. I'm leaning towards medium because it's neutral without more info.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college\u2014this suggests she has some education but isn't continuing her studies. Some argue that higher education can reduce recidivism, so maybe this is a low risk factor since she's educated but not furthering her education.\n\nShe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs shows stability, which is good for reducing recidivism. So I'd say low weight here because job stability is positive.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana specifically. Drug use can have negative consequences on mental health and relationships, but since she's not currently using, maybe this factor isn't as strong. However, past use could indicate potential relapse, so perhaps medium weight.\n\nHer feelings of low mood for much of the month might point to underlying mental health issues. This could increase risk because untreated depression or anxiety can lead to substance abuse and other behaviors that contribute to recidivism. So this factor should be high weight.\n\nYoung age at 20 with a history of living with her mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, which might affect her safety. Also, living with family could mean she's not getting support or might face domestic issues. This seems like a medium risk factor because it's not the worst but still concerning.\n\nConsidering God as something that affects her life is positive\u2014it suggests she has some spirituality and might seek help when needed. So low weight here.\n\nPutting this all together, I think there are factors that could increase her risk, especially the mood issues and past drug use. The job stability and education are good signs but don't outweigh the negatives. So my prediction would be a YES with high confidence because of the significant risk factors present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Previous Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest, which may indicate past involvement with the judicial system but does not necessarily correlate directly with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally a protective factor unless there are known issues such as domestic violence or significant trauma, which are not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and not currently enrolled in college suggests some level of education but does not inherently increase risk without additional factors like substance abuse or unstable living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"low\", \"Holding four jobs during the past year indicates good job stability, which is typically associated with reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood could indicate potential substance abuse issues or mental health concerns that may contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area, along with considering God as something that affects her life, suggests some level of support but also potential challenges related to domestic dynamics or societal stressors in the urban environment.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for much of the past month could indicate untreated mental health issues, which are significant risk factors for substance abuse and other behaviors that may contribute to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
