    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. From what I know, there's some evidence of racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but since he's young and has a high school diploma, maybe that doesn't play a big role here. So probably low risk from this factor.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That's not a lot, so medium risk because it shows some history but isn't extensive.\n\nAge is 20, which is considered low risk for recidivism since younger individuals often have different needs and may be more likely to change their behavior before they're older.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here. Maybe if he was overweight or something, but nothing stands out. So probably no impact on the risk factors.\n\nHe's living alone, which is a bit concerning because living with family can provide support and reduce stress, so maybe slightly low risk from this factor.\n\nNo marital status mentioned, but since he's 20, it's not a big issue. Maybe medium risk if he's single, as being in a relationship could offer stability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because it can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability. So low risk here.\n\nHe's worked two jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide income stability and reduce dependency on the criminal justice system, so maybe medium risk since two jobs are good but not necessarily high-paying or unrelated.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a strong positive indicator of lower risk. That's definitely low risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Being mentally stable can help avoid self-harm or other risky behaviors, so that's another low risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in a household of four. While family support is important, living with multiple people might indicate some stress, but it could also mean he has friends to talk to. Maybe medium risk because the size doesn't directly correlate to higher risk unless there's neglect or abuse.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal outcomes. That's a positive factor as religious beliefs can provide guidance and reduce self-harm risks, so low risk here.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior arrest (medium), education (low), living alone (slightly low but maybe medium if aloneness is a risk), two jobs (medium), no drug use (low), mental health (low), family background (medium), and belief in God (low). \n\nThe prior arrest might be the highest risk factor here. So overall, I'd lean towards low confidence of rearrest because most factors are positive or mitigating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"His one prior arrest and one conviction indicate some history but not extensive risk.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 20, which is considered low risk for recidivism as younger individuals often have different needs.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may provide some support, reducing stress and potentially lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"With a high school diploma and enrolled in college, education typically correlates with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"jobs\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs during the year can offer stability but doesn't necessarily correlate with high success or unrelated work.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong indicator of low risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests mental stability and reduced risk factors.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of size 4 may indicate some stress but could also mean having friends to talk to, which mitigates risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Considering God's influence on personal outcomes suggests positive guidance and reduced self-harm risks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
