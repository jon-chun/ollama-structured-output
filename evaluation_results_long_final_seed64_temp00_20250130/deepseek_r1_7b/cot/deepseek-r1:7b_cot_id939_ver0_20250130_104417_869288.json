    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male having rearrest within three years. He's Black, hasn't been convicted yet but has an arrest, so maybe there's some residual criminal history despite not being convicted. His age is quite young, which might mean he's still developing skills and might be more prone to mistakes.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That's a pretty average weight for his height, so maybe no significant health issues related to weight that could affect him. He's living alone, which can sometimes lead to isolation or stress, but he's not married either.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, so maybe he's looking for more opportunities but hasn't found them yet. That could be a positive sign as it shows initiative, but if he's not engaged with his community, that might be a risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year, which is good because job experience can help build skills and stability. No drug use in the past four years is a strong positive; substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so mental health seems okay. His belief in God might provide some support or structure, but it's not directly related to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and stressors, which might contribute to substance abuse or other issues that could lead to recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the risk is medium because while there are some negative points like living situation and possible isolation, he has positive attributes like education and stable employment. The urban environment isn't a direct risk factor but might be an indirect one through underlying stressors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young age (19 years) may indicate less life experience and higher potential for mistakes.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"medium\", \"One arrest, not convicted; however, lack of conviction may suggest lower risk compared to multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Average weight for height, suggesting no significant health issues related to weight.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally stable and less likely to contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Not married; may indicate focus on personal goals rather than substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma, which can be a positive indicator of future stability and reduced risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Two job holds in the past year; employment is generally linked to lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month; mental health stability may reduce risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believes in God, which can provide support and structure but not directly related to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Urban Environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of three in an urban area; urban environments can have higher stressors contributing to substance abuse or other issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
