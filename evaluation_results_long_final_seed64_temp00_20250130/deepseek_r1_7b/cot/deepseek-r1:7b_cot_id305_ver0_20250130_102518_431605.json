I don't think race is a direct indicator of recidivism in most systems, but it might be part of a larger dataset analysis. So maybe low weight here.\n\nHe has two arrests but no convictions. That could mean he's not taking his crimes seriously, which might lower the risk compared to someone with convictions.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly related to recidivism, so probably medium or low impact.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014stability is key. Living alone can increase stress and isolation, so maybe a bit higher risk than average but not extremely high.\n\nHe's in school, which suggests he's focused on improving himself, possibly reducing future criminal behavior. So that might be a mitigating factor.\n\nOne job during the year\u2014he\u2019s employed, which shows responsibility. That should lower his risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to more impulsive behavior or substance abuse issues, which could increase recidivism. The recent lack of depression might suggest he's managed it better, so maybe medium impact.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with both parents\u2014family support is usually positive, so that should be low risk.\n\nBelieving in God\u2014he sees a higher power as part of his life. That can provide some moral guidance and reduce stress, so probably low to no risk from this factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history without convictions might be a point, but the other factors are mostly positive. Drug use is a concern, but he's managed it recently. So overall, I'd say low risk with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"The individual has two arrests without convictions, which may indicate lower recidivism risk compared to those with convictions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years could increase rearrest risk, though recent lack of depression suggests better management.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Currently employed full-time indicates responsibility and stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in a household of four provides family support, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may provide moral guidance and reduce stress, further mitigating recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
