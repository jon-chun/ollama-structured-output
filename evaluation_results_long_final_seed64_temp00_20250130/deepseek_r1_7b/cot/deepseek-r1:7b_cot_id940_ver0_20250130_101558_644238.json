    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19, which is relatively young, but she's not convicted yet just arrested once. That might be a positive because she hasn't had any significant legal consequences beyond an arrest. But since she's still in high school and college, maybe she's actively seeking better opportunities or help.\n\nShe identifies as White, which isn't directly a risk factor unless there are systemic issues, but I don't have specific data on that here. So probably low weight for her race.\n\nHeight is 5'6\" and weight 165 lbs. No immediate red flags from that; she's within a normal range. No indication of physical health issues either.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. That might suggest some independence, but it could also mean she doesn't have support networks which can be risky if she struggles with substance use or other issues.\n\nHigh school diploma and in college for two years. Education is usually protective against recidivism, so that should lower her risk.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having a steady job might indicate some stability, but it also means she has limited time to seek help if needed.\n\nDrug use: She used cocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Cocaine use can lead to relapse, which could increase recidivism risk. The fact that she's not feeling depressed now is concerning because drug use often leads to mood changes or withdrawal symptoms.\n\nLiving with her parents at a young age in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and stressors, but since she's living alone now, maybe she's managed it better. However, family history isn't directly tied to recidivism unless there are other factors like support from family.\n\nConsidering God as something that affects her life is a positive sign; spirituality often correlates with better self-care and lower substance use.\n\nPutting this all together: The drug use seems to be the most concerning factor here. She's been using cocaine, which can lead to relapse, and not feeling depressed might indicate ongoing issues or denial of the problem. The rest of her factors are mixed but don't outweigh that risk. So I'd lean towards high risk because of the drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 19, which might indicate she's actively seeking better opportunities or help despite a single arrest.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being White doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism risk without systemic issues.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant health indicators from her physical attributes.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could mean less support, which might be risky if she struggles with substance use.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma and attending college suggests stability and proactive steps toward recovery.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding one job indicates some independence but limited time for seeking help.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Using cocaine in the past four years without feeling depressed could indicate ongoing issues or denial, increasing risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Urban Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with parents at a young age might have stressors, but she's now living alone which could be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
