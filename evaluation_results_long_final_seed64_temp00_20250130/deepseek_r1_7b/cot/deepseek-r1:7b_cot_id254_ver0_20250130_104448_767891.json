    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That's a significant red flag because more past convictions usually mean higher recidivism risk. I think that would lean towards high risk.\n\nShe's 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 160 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor in risk assessment unless it's extreme, but she seems within a normal range. So maybe this doesn't add much to the risk factors.\n\nNot being married and not living alone\u2014she's an adult, so she could be managing her finances or other responsibilities on her own. This might indicate some level of independence, which isn't necessarily a strong protective factor here.\n\nShe's enrolled in school now, which is positive because education can lead to better job opportunities and stability. That should lower the risk.\n\nOnly held one job during the year\u2014she might be transitioning between jobs or maybe she's self-sufficient enough to manage without multiple roles. This could be a mitigating factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is great. Drug abuse is a major contributor to recidivism, so not using drugs would definitely lower her risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month\u2014mental health can affect one's ability to reintegrate into society or manage daily tasks. Being stable mentally is another positive sign.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That's a large family, which might suggest she was raised in a different environment than typical, but it could also indicate potential challenges that have been addressed since then.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with her life\u2014this is interesting. It might reflect a strong personal belief system, but I'm not sure how that affects risk factors. Maybe it's more about her motivation or lack thereof in certain areas.\n\nPutting all this together: four arrests and two convictions are major red flags (high risk). The other factors don't seem to add significant protective elements. So the overall prediction would lean towards high risk with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and two convictions indicate a past tendency for criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age and height\", \"low\", \"Age at 18 suggests she may be managing her responsibilities effectively.
