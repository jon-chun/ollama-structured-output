    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old male having rearrest within three years. He's Black, hasn't been convicted yet but has an arrest, so maybe that's a point against him. His height and weight don't seem relevant here.\n\nHe's living alone, which might mean he doesn't have support from family or friends who could help him if something happens. He's never married, so no spousal support either. Education-wise, he has a high school diploma but isn't in college, maybe not getting the skills needed for better job opportunities later.\n\nHe's worked four jobs in a year; that's pretty active, which might indicate he's been trying to get out of trouble before. Drug use is only marijuana in the past four years, so maybe he's clean now or doesn't have substance abuse as a big issue. He hasn't felt depressed recently, so no mental health issues that I can see.\n\nHe was living with his biological mother when he was young in a household of five. That might suggest some family support but also potential challenges like neglect or abuse if the environment wasn't ideal. His religious beliefs about God influencing his life could mean he's seeking help or has strong moral values, which might be positive for him.\n\nPutting this all together: He has one prior arrest, which is a red flag because it shows he's had trouble before. He's not convicted yet, so maybe he's still working on things. His living situation alone and never married could mean less support network. His education level isn't the highest, which might limit opportunities for better job prospects in the future.\n\nHe's worked four jobs, which is a lot, but it also shows he's been proactive in finding work despite his past issues. No drug use beyond marijuana, so maybe he's clean now or doesn't have substance abuse as a problem. No recent depression, so no mental health issues to add to the risk.\n\nThe family background might not be ideal if there were issues at home when he was young, but since it's just mentioned without specifics, I can only assume it's okay. His religious beliefs are positive and could aid in his personal growth or seeking help.\n\nSo considering all these factors: prior arrest (medium), living alone (low to medium), never married (low?), education level (low), four jobs (maybe mitigates a bit), drug use (low), no recent depression, family background (not sure). The strongest risk is the prior arrest. So maybe his overall risk is low because he's actively working through things despite one arrest.\n\nWait, but if he has one prior arrest and hasn't been convicted, that might still be a significant risk factor. Maybe medium? But since he's actively employed four jobs, perhaps it lowers the risk to low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest which can indicate past behavior issues and may influence future criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces potential family support, which might limit avenues for assistance in case of need.\"),\n    (\"never_married\", \"low\", \"Not being married could mean fewer spousal support options, potentially affecting his ability to seek help if needed.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment may limit future job opportunities and educational resources that could aid in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"four_jobs\", \"medium\", \"While working four jobs shows active efforts to find employment, it might also indicate past instability which could be a mitigating factor but still present risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Drug use only in marijuana over the past four years suggests potential abstinence or minimal substance abuse, reducing risk factors related to drug dependency.\"),\n    (\"no_depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression indicates no mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five without specific issues suggests some level of family support but may also hint at potential challenges if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
