Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him, but since it's not mentioned, maybe it's low weight.\n\nHe has one arrest and no conviction. That might be a medium risk because even though it's an arrest, not being convicted could mean he's managed to avoid serious legal consequences.\n\nHis height is 5'8\" and weight 140 lbs. No info on BMI or health issues here, so probably low weight for this factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since he's an adult, maybe it's medium risk if there are no other factors.\n\nHigh school diploma not in college\u2014so some education, which might be a protective factor, making the risk lower.\n\nHe has two jobs during the year. Employment is usually good for reducing recidivism, so this could be low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to unstable behavior or relapse, but since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe medium.\n\nHe lived with both parents at a young age in a rural area of size 4. That's a protective environment, so low risk unless there were issues there that affected him negatively.\n\nBelieves in God\u2014religion can provide support and reduce stress, so this is probably low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium to high risk because of past drug use and the lack of conviction despite an arrest. The other factors seem positive or neutral.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"An arrest record without a conviction can indicate potential for future behavior issues, though it may not be as significant as other factors like substance use or living situation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use could lead to unstable behavior or relapse, despite recent lack of depression symptoms, which might affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Having two jobs during the year suggests stable income and support, which is protective against rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or neglect, but without additional context, it's considered low risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma not in college indicates some education, which is generally protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may provide support and reduce stress, contributing to lower risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
