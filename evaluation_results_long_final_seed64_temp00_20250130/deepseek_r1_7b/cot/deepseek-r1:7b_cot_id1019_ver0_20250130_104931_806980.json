    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's only been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a positive because at least one offense hasn't resulted in a conviction, which could mean less severe penalties or maybe he's managed to avoid longer sentences. So that's probably low risk.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 147 lbs. Weight isn't directly related to recidivism unless it's about substance use, but since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, his weight might not be a factor here. Maybe medium risk because being underweight or overweight can sometimes correlate with substance abuse issues, but he's clean now.\n\nHe's living alone and never married. Living alone doesn't directly cause recidivism, but it could indicate some level of independence which might reduce risk factors like domestic violence or neglect. So maybe low to medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education can correlate with lower recidivism because more education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. So that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nHe has two jobs, so he's employed enough to support himself. Employment is usually protective against recidivism, so another low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression in the past month. These are positive indicators of good mental health and substance abuse control, which should lower his risk significantly\u2014maybe high protection here.\n\nHe was raised in a household of six with both parents when young in an urban area. That's a bit concerning because living with multiple siblings can sometimes lead to issues like neglect or abuse. Urban environments might have different stressors compared to rural areas, but it's still a factor that could contribute to higher risk\u2014so medium.\n\nHis belief in God is positive for moral guidance and support system, which likely reduces risk factors related to lack of direction or substance abuse. So high protection here as well.\n\nPutting all these together: one non-convicted arrest (low), weight not directly relevant but no drug use (medium), living alone (low-medium), education (low), two jobs (low), no drug use/depression (high), family background (medium), and religious belief (high). \n\nThe strongest risk factors are the family background and lack of religion, which might slightly increase risk. However, since he's young, has good mental health, and is employed, his overall risk is probably low to medium.\n\nI think I'll assign a relative weight where most factors lean towards low or medium, but with some higher ones pulling it up just enough for the prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"He has only been arrested once and not convicted, which suggests he may have avoided severe penalties.
