    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I don't think race plays a significant role in recidivism rates compared to other factors like socioeconomic status or education. So maybe that's low risk.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and one conviction. That's a red flag because having a criminal history increases the chance of reoffending. So medium risk there.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and he weighs 128 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like weight or height are relevant here, so probably low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but since he's an adult with no ties, maybe it's medium risk because isolation might contribute to substance use or other issues.\n\nHigh school diploma means he has some education, which is generally protective against recidivism compared to less education. So low risk there.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities for income. That would be low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct cause, but it could indicate potential substance abuse issues which might lead to more serious offenses. So maybe medium risk.\n\nNo recent depression symptoms suggest he's mentally stable, so that's protective against recidivism. Low risk here.\n\nHe was raised in a household of four with both parents when young in a rural area. Growing up in such a close environment could have both positive and negative aspects. While it might foster strong family bonds, it could also lead to higher stress or substance use if not properly supervised. So medium risk because the rural setting might offer fewer resources for support.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his life. Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance but don't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like lack of faith in personal responsibility.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and education are protective, but drug use and living situation could be contributing factors. The risk factors seem balanced, so I'd predict a low to medium risk. Maybe leaning towards low because he has some positive attributes offsetting the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"His race is White, which does not significantly impact recidivism rates compared to other factors like socioeconomic status or education.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and one conviction increase the risk of reoffending but are mitigated by positive factors like education and job stability.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics such as height and weight do not influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone does not directly correlate with higher risk but could be influenced by isolation leading to substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is generally protective against recidivism compared to lower education levels.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"low\", \"Holding four jobs in a year provides stability and reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities for income.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, could indicate potential substance abuse issues which might lead to more serious offenses.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression symptoms suggest he is mentally stable, providing protection against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of four with both parents in a rural area could have both positive and negative aspects affecting risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God's influence on his life provides moral guidance but does not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
