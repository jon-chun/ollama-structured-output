    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old with a GED but not in college. That might mean he has some educational background which could correlate with better job opportunities or higher income, so maybe that's a low risk factor? But I'm not sure how much education affects recidivism specifically.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. So he's still on probation or maybe in a detainer. If he gets back into trouble, it might be easier to get caught again because he has a criminal history. That could push his risk up to medium.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they're just physical attributes without any context about health issues or anything else.\n\nHe's living alone, which is common for someone of his age. Not sure if that affects recidivism directly, but maybe it's a neutral factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can sometimes lead to more criminal behavior, so this could be a medium risk factor because it might increase his chances of getting into trouble again.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's interesting. Depression isn't directly linked to recidivism, but if he's not feeling well, maybe he's struggling with other issues that could affect his behavior or ability to reintegrate after being released.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived in a household of size 2 with non-biological parents in a rural area. That might mean he had less supervision and different living conditions now compared to growing up in a stable environment. This could be a medium risk factor because unstable upbringing can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe believes in God but doesn't know if that affects his recidivism. It's more of a personal belief, so probably not directly related to the risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: He has one non-convicted arrest, which is medium. Drug use and living in an unstable environment are also medium. Education isn't a strong positive here but maybe slightly mitigates some risk. So overall, I think his risk of rearrest is high because he's got multiple factors that could lead to reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Non-convicted arrest\", \"medium\", \"Having one non-convicted arrest can increase the likelihood of reoffending as it may signal past behavior that could be repeated.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, is often linked to higher recidivism rates due to potential behavioral changes or increased risk-taking.\"),\n    (\"Unstable upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 2 with non-biological parents in a rural area can contribute to unstable family dynamics and may influence criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
