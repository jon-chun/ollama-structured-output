    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old male rearrest based on his background. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting him, but since it's not mentioned, maybe it's low weight.\n\nHe has one arrest and no conviction. That's just one point against him; maybe medium risk because it shows some prior contact with law enforcement.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so probably low weight.\n\nNot married and living alone\u2014maybe indicates he's in a stable environment? Not sure if that's high or low, but perhaps medium since it doesn't directly correlate with crime.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Maybe lower risk because he's not continuing his education, which could lead to better opportunities. So maybe medium weight.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability, so that might be low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct indicator of future issues unless there are underlying mental health problems. Since he doesn't feel depressed now, maybe it's medium weight.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area at a young age. That's a big family and urban environment\u2014could be high risk due to exposure to negative influences or higher crime rates.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life might suggest he doesn't have strong spiritual support, which could lead to higher risk as he might turn to other factors like drugs or gangs for help. So high weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: The living situation and lack of spiritual support seem to be the strongest indicators. Even though he has a GED and some job experience, his past environment and current beliefs are more concerning. I'd lean towards medium risk but with higher concerns.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 20 years old, which may indicate early onset of criminal behavior, though this can vary significantly.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without a conviction suggests some exposure to the justice system but does not directly correlate with immediate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Gender and Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Not married and living alone may indicate personal stability, which is generally protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED and not enrolled in college could be seen as a barrier to further education and potential positive influences, but it's not directly indicative of risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding four jobs may indicate stability and economic independence, which are protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years could be a risk factor if associated with underlying mental health issues or other risky behaviors.
