    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of 10 arrests and 10 convictions. That's a lot! Recidivistic tendencies usually increase with more past offenses. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 160 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly affect recidivism, so maybe this is low to medium.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, but since he's an adult with no kids, it might not be a big factor here\u2014maybe low risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Education level is a known predictor of recidivism; lower education often correlates with higher chances. So that's another high risk factor.\n\nHe held only one job last year. Job stability can affect personal motivation and ability to support himself, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential substance misuse, which can lead to more criminal behavior or increased risk factors. High risk because of this.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While mental health issues can contribute, he's reported no recent depression, so maybe that's low risk compared to previous states.\n\nYoung age and living with a household of three. Younger individuals might be less experienced, but household size could provide more support, possibly lowering risk\u2014maybe medium here.\n\nReligious belief in God affecting his personal outcomes. While belief can influence behavior, it doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism rates unless there's evidence suggesting otherwise. So perhaps low to medium.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple high factors (arrests, lack of education, job issues, drug use) and some lower ones. The overall risk is likely high because the arrest history alone is a strong indicator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"10 arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"High risk due to multiple past offenses which indicate a tendency for criminal behavior to continue.\"),\n    (\"Never married, living alone\", \"low\", \"Living situation may provide limited support but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism risk without additional factors.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a known predictor of recidivism as it can limit opportunities and support systems.\"),\n    (\"Held only one job last year\", \"medium\", \"Job instability may affect motivation and ability to support oneself but does not strongly indicate high risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor as it can lead to further criminal behavior or increased stress factors.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression, past month\", \"low\", \"No recent mental health issues may suggest better coping mechanisms but does not negate previous behavioral patterns.\"),\n    (\"Household size of 3 at young age\", \"medium\", \"Support from a household could mitigate some risk factors but does not directly correlate with high recidivism without other indicators.\"),\n    (\"Believes in God's influence on personal outcomes\", \"low\", \"Religious belief may provide moral guidance but does not inherently increase risk unless there is evidence of negative behavior influenced by this belief.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
