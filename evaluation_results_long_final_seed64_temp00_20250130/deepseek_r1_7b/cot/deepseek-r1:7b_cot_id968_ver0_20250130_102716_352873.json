    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. From what I know, there's some evidence that being White can be associated with lower recidivism rates compared to other racial groups, but it's not always the case and varies based on other factors like socioeconomic status or systemic issues. So maybe this isn't a strong factor here.\n\nHe has two arrests but no convictions. Having prior arrests without convictions might indicate some past behavior that didn't result in legal consequences. I'm not sure how significant that is compared to more serious offenses, though. It's something to consider but probably not the most impactful on his risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 140 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like this typically play a big role in recidivism assessments unless there's evidence of substance abuse or other health issues linked to them, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can be related to support systems, but since he's an adult without dependents, it might not directly affect his risk much. However, being single could sometimes correlate with higher risk if there are underlying issues like substance abuse or lack of supervision.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism because more education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability. So this might be a protective factor here.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment, especially full-time, is generally associated with lower recidivism rates as it provides stability and reduces the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a significant risk factor because substance abuse often leads to other criminal behaviors or increases the drive to commit new crimes for drug-related reasons. However, since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe this isn't as concerning.\n\nHis background: At a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. This might suggest he was raised in a stable environment but could also indicate exposure to certain influences that might affect his behavior later on. Urban environments can sometimes have higher rates of crime or substance abuse, which could be related.\n\nHis belief in God: He says God has nothing to do with his personal events. This could relate to his own beliefs influencing his behavior, possibly leading him towards riskier choices if he's not guided by a higher power. However, this is more of a personal statement and might not directly correlate with recidivism unless there are underlying issues like mental health or substance abuse.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors that stand out as high risk would be the drug use history because past drug use can lead to further criminal behavior. The lack of convictions from arrests could also be a point, but since he's only got two, maybe it's not too bad. His living situation and education are protective.\n\nSo overall, I think his risk is medium. There are some factors that might increase the risk, especially drug use, but other protective factors like education and stable living situation balance it out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Having a White background may correlate with lower recidivism rates due to systemic factors, though this varies based on socioeconomic status and other variables.\"),\n    (\"Arrests without Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions could indicate past behavior that might not have led to legal consequences but should be considered in the context of other risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight typically do not directly influence recidivism rates unless linked to health issues or substance abuse, which is not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there are underlying issues like substance abuse or lack of supervision, though this individual's situation may offer some protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is strongly associated with lower recidivism rates due to increased stability and opportunities for positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Holding one job during the year can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity, acting as a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine, despite not feeling depressed recently, can be a significant risk factor due to potential underlying issues or increased drive for criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in an urban area at a young age might suggest exposure to influences that could affect later behavior but does not directly correlate strongly with recidivism without additional context about the environment's safety and resources.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"His statement that God has nothing to do with his personal events may influence his behavior, potentially leading him towards riskier choices if not guided by higher values or support systems.
