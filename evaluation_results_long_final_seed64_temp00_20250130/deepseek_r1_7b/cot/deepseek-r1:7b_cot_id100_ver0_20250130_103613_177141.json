    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearrest within three years. He's American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut, which might have some cultural factors at play. He has a history of nine arrests and convictions, that's really high. Age-wise, being 19 is on the younger side but he's had multiple offenses so maybe his age isn't directly affecting it as much.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 180 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism, but without knowing his BMI or other health factors, I'm not sure how to assess that yet. He's living alone, which might mean he doesn't have the same support structure as someone living with family or friends.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college, so educational challenges could contribute to recidivism. Plus, he hasn't held any jobs during the past year, which is concerning because employment can help reduce recidivism risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. I'm not sure if recent drug use is a strong indicator of future issues since he's not feeling depressed now. Maybe it's a trigger that could lead to substance abuse problems again.\n\nHe lived in a household of eight when young, which might have had its own set of challenges\u2014maybe more stress or less supervision as part of growing up. His belief in God could be a positive factor, but sometimes religious factors can also influence behavior if they're controlling.\n\nPutting it all together: The high number of arrests and convictions is a strong red flag. His lack of education and employment ties into his risk profile. Living alone without support might increase stress or substance use issues. While his recent drug use isn't directly linked to depression, it's something to consider. His young age could be a mitigating factor if he's making positive changes, but given the history, I'm leaning towards high risk.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the prediction is high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High number of arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with nine arrests and multiple convictions, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living alone without support\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase stress or substance use issues, contributing to potential recidivism but not as directly as other factors like education or employment status.\"),\n    (\"Lack of education and employment\", \"high\", \"A lack of high school diploma and no job involvement during the past year can contribute to financial instability and increased risk of engaging in criminal activities again.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history without recent depression\", \"low\", \"While he used marijuana in the past four years, there is no direct link to recent feelings of depression, which might suggest that this behavior is not a significant current issue but could still be a concern if it leads to substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Young age and household size at a young age\", \"medium\", \"His young age may indicate potential for positive change, but the history of living in a large household could have had negative influences such as lack of supervision or family stress, which might contribute indirectly to risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is not directly linked to criminal behavior unless it is controlling.
