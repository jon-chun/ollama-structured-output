Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times and convicted. That's a solid indicator of past criminal behavior, which usually means higher risk. So that's high risk right there.\n\nShe's White, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some systemic bias, which isn't indicated. So maybe medium or low? Not sure yet.\n\nHer height and weight aren't directly relevant to recidivism, so probably no impact on the risk factors.\n\nMarried living with her spouse\u2014stability in home environment could be positive, but I don't see a direct link here. Maybe she's more likely to seek help because of support, but not sure how that affects rearrest rates.\n\nHigh school diploma and not college\u2014it might suggest some level of education, which is usually associated with lower recidivism, so maybe medium risk.\n\nShe held one job during the year\u2014unemployment can be a risk factor. If she's not working, she might have more time to engage in risky behavior or seek other opportunities that could lead to reoffending.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana before and recently felt down. Drug use is definitely a red flag for substance abuse, which can contribute to recidivism. So high risk here.\n\nYoung age of living with non-biological parents\u2014could be associated with higher risk due to instability or lack of supervision from biological parents, but I'm not sure how that translates to recidivism specifically.\n\nBelief in God: This is more about personal motivation and might not directly correlate with criminal behavior. Unless she's using religion as a coping mechanism for substance abuse, which could be relevant, but it's unclear.\n\nPutting it all together: The three most significant factors are the prior convictions (high), drug use (high), and unemployment from holding only one job (medium). So overall, I'd lean towards high risk. Maybe 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions which is typically associated with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, particularly marijuana, can increase the likelihood of substance abuse and related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job may indicate potential unemployment or underemployment, which could be a moderate risk factor for reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 6.
