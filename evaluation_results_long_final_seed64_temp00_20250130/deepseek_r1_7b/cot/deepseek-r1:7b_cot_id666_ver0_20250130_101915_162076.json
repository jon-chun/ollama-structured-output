    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young. Young adults often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their decision-making skills and might not have the same life experiences as older individuals. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but since he's 18 and just starting out, maybe this isn't as significant yet compared to other factors like prior convictions or substance use.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Having a conviction is a strong indicator of past behavior that could lead to more issues. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 140 lbs, but I don't think physical characteristics contribute much here unless there's something about his body type affecting his behavior, which doesn't seem relevant.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living with family can provide support, so that might actually lower the risk compared to someone living in a different environment or without support.\n\nEnrolled in school now is positive because education can lead to better job opportunities and less involvement in the criminal system. So that's low risk.\n\nNo jobs during the past year means he's not actively engaged in income-producing activities, which could contribute to dependency issues like substance use.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a major red flag because it can impair judgment, lead to unstable behavior, and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky situations or further substance abuse.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month might be a bit tricky. If he's using drugs but not feeling down, maybe he's managing them to cope with stress or other issues. However, long-term drug use can still have negative consequences even if there's no immediate emotional distress.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such a close environment might lead to different dynamics, but it doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there were issues within that family that affected him negatively.\n\nConsidering that God has something to do with his personal events suggests he's religious and may have a strong moral compass, which could be positive or negative depending on how that influences his behavior. However, without specific evidence of sin or unethical behavior influenced by religion, it's hard to quantify this as a risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: high due to prior convictions, drug use, age, and lack of support from family living alone. The presence of substance abuse is a strong indicator. So the prediction would be high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young adults often have higher recidivism rates due to developing decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"One prior conviction indicates past behavior that could lead to more issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine increases the likelihood of unstable behavior and risky situations.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may provide less support compared to family living together, which can affect stability.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school indicates positive engagement with education leading to better opportunities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
