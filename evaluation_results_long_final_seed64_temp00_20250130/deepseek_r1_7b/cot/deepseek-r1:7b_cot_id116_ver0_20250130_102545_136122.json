    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I don't think race plays a significant role in recidivism rates compared to other factors like socioeconomic status or prior convictions. So maybe that's low risk.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. That might be a red flag because even if it's not a conviction, it could indicate some underlying issues he's facing. But since it's just an arrest, I'm leaning towards medium risk here.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism. Maybe they're included for completeness, but no impact on the risk assessment.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might increase stress or substance use issues. So that could be a medium factor contributing to higher risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides better opportunities. So this should be low risk.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year. Employment can help with financial stability and reducing stress, so that's another low factor.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to other issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, which might affect his ability to reintegrate into society. Since he hasn't felt depressed lately, maybe it's less severe, so medium risk here.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. That's a big family living situation, which could mean instability or neglect. Urban areas might have different dynamics compared to smaller towns, but the size of the household is a significant factor. So that's high risk.\n\nHis belief in God: If he doesn't see a divine role in his life, it might affect his motivation towards positive actions or seeking help for substance abuse. This could be medium risk because lack of religious support can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates related to substance use.\n\nPutting it all together: The high household size and living situation are the biggest factors pushing him towards high risk. The arrest is medium, but the rest are low except for the drug use which is medium. So overall, I'd lean towards a high relative weight because of the family environment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"His race is White, which generally does not significantly impact recidivism rates compared to other factors like socioeconomic status or prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without a conviction may indicate underlying issues that could contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone in a household of five with no religious involvement and in an urban area can lead to increased stress, isolation, and substance use issues, significantly impacting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Employed one job during the year, which provides financial stability and reduces stress, indicating lower risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
