    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her race is White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues and disparities in the criminal justice system. But since she's young and has only one arrest without a conviction, maybe the impact isn't too significant here. Still, it's something to consider.\n\nShe has no prior convictions but one arrest. That's important because having an arrest without a conviction might affect her risk compared to someone with a full conviction. I think that could be a medium factor against her since it shows she's been stopped before but not punished beyond that.\n\nHer height and weight aren't directly related, so maybe they don't play a role here. It's more about other factors like living situation or employment.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can increase stress and isolation, which might contribute to higher recidivism rates. That sounds like a medium risk factor because it's not the most severe but still significant enough to consider.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is inversely related to recidivism; more education usually means lower chances of reoffending. So this could be low, but since she's 20, maybe her education is recent or she's planning to go back, which might affect it.\n\nShe held four jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability and reduce stress, so that's a positive sign. That would likely lower her risk factor, probably low because consistent employment is good for reintegration.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) could be concerning. Drug use can lead to substance abuse issues which might make her more prone to criminal behavior or other problems. So this is a medium factor against her.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so that's positive because depression can sometimes lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors. That would be low risk for this factor.\n\nHer young age and living with both parents at a household of five in a rural area might have contributed to her independence but could also indicate higher family support, which is good. However, the rural setting might mean less supervision, so maybe that's a medium factor against her because she's relying on herself more than supported environments.\n\nHer belief in God not affecting her personal life could influence her coping mechanisms. If she doesn't rely on religion for emotional support, she might face different stressors which could affect her ability to handle stress or make good decisions. That's another medium risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest (medium against), living alone (medium against), drug use (medium against). The rest are positive factors with low or no impact. So the overall risk is probably low, but considering she has some negative factors, maybe around 25% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest without a conviction which could affect her risk compared to those with convictions.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases stress and isolation, contributing to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana) may increase susceptibility to criminal behavior or other issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
