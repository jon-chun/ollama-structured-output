    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearrest within three years. He's got a few factors here that might influence his recidivism.\n\nFirst off, he has two arrests but no convictions. That means he's been caught twice before getting out of custody, which could indicate some past issues. But since he hasn't been convicted, maybe the charges weren't severe or he managed to clear them without going to trial. I'm not sure how that affects his risk compared to someone with a conviction.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 170 lbs. That doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag in terms of weight or height, but maybe it's relevant if he has health issues. He's living alone, which can be risky because isolation might lead to substance abuse or other problems. But since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, that's a positive sign.\n\nHe's got a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe he's looking for more education but hasn't started yet. Not being enrolled could mean he's not motivated enough to get back into school, which might correlate with lower recidivism if he's seeking better opportunities. But it also depends on his motivation to change.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year. Joblessness can be a risk factor because having income can provide stability and reduce the incentive to engage in criminal activities. However, maybe he's working part-time or looking for something else, so that might not be as strong of an indicator.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a good sign because depression is linked to higher recidivism rates. If he's mentally stable, it could lower his risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of five. That means he was raised in a larger family, which might have different dynamics compared to smaller households. Maybe the environment there wasn't as strict or supportive, but again, that depends on what kind of support is available.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it's related to his personal events. That could be a positive factor because religious beliefs often provide guidance and structure, reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. It might also indicate he has some level of accountability for his actions.\n\nPutting this all together: He has two arrests without convictions, which is a moderate risk compared to someone with a conviction. His living situation alone could be a concern but he's not using drugs, so that's mitigating. Joblessness and no college enrollment are factors, but maybe he's motivated enough. No depression in the past month is positive. Religiously inclined might help.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because several factors point toward stability: no drug use, no recent depression, and religious belief. However, having two arrests without convictions could still be a consideration. Maybe medium risk? But I think it's more on the lower side.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Two prior arrests without convictions\", \"low\", \"Having two arrests but no convictions suggests past issues that may not have led to long-term complications, indicating potentially lower risk compared to those with convictions.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase risks of substance abuse or other issues, though the absence of recent drug use and depression mitigates this factor.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma, not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"This indicates a focus on education, which may correlate with lower recidivism as it suggests seeking better opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"One job held during the year\", \"low\", \"Joblessness can be stabilizing; holding at least one job might reduce criminal incentives.
