Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 10 times and convicted\u2014 that's a lot. Recidivism is high for someone with that many convictions. Each prior offense increases the chances of reoffending because he's already struggled with the system.\n\nHe's Black, which might mean systemic issues affecting him, but I don't have enough info on how race plays into recidivism here. He's 6'0\" and weighs 195 lbs\u2014 not sure if that affects it directly, maybe if there are health issues, but no info given about that.\n\nLiving alone is a risk factor because isolation can lead to emotional or substance abuse problems without support. He hasn't held a job during the year\u2014he's been unemployed for a while, which might contribute to dependency on drugs and other negative behaviors.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED\u2014 educational barriers can prevent him from accessing better opportunities and might drive him into criminal activities as a result.\n\nDrug use history is another big one. He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug abuse often leads to more criminal behavior, like theft or violence, which increases the chance of being arrested again.\n\nHe was raised in a household of seven in a rural area\u2014 living with many adults might have caused emotional neglect if he's emotionally detached. This could lead to behavioral issues that manifest later on.\n\nBelieving in God is his religion\u2014he doesn't see it as a problem but maybe as a protective factor? Not sure, but it's not directly linked to recidivism here.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests, no education, unemployment, drug use, living alone. All these factors point towards high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of 10 arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment and Lack of Education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education (no diploma or GED) and unemployment can contribute to substance abuse and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of low mood may indicate drug dependency, which is a strong risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases the risk of emotional or substance abuse issues without support, contributing to potential criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"low\", \"While living with seven adults in a rural area might suggest some level of supervision, it doesn't directly correlate with reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may provide personal protective factors but does not directly indicate higher recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 195 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
