    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which is a minor offense. His height and weight don't seem relevant here; it's more about his personal circumstances.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone, so he might be in a relationship or with family. That could provide some support, reducing his risk. No high school diploma or GED means he has limited education, which often correlates with higher recidivism because he might not have the skills needed for better job opportunities.\n\nHe's only held one job recently, and that was for a short time. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other issues, so that's a red flag. He hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive, but his lack of education might make him turn to other substances if needed.\n\nLiving at a young age with 10 other people seems stressful. Young males living in large households often face challenges like neglect or abuse, which can contribute to criminal behavior. His belief in God not affecting his life could mean he's more likely to engage in risky behaviors without religious guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: minor offense, limited education, unemployment, family living situation, and lack of religious support. These factors point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrest\", \"low\", \"He has been arrested once but not convicted, which is a minor offense.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, indicating limited educational opportunities which may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"He has held 1 job during the year but is not currently employed full-time, which could lead to dependency issues affecting his ability to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"low\", \"He has not used any drugs in the past four years, indicating a clean record and reduced risk from substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"family_living_conditions\", \"medium\", \"At a young age, he lived in a household of size 11, which may have posed challenges such as neglect or abuse, increasing his risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally, which could lead to increased risky behavior without religious guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
