    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested five times and convicted. That's a high number of prior convictions, which is definitely a red flag for recidivism. Each arrest increases her chances of getting into trouble again.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150-174 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly affect recidivism rates unless there are other factors like substance use, which she has a history of.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, but without more info on her support network, it's hard to say how much that affects her risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is usually linked to lower recidivism rates because people with higher education are more likely to have stable jobs or further their goals.\n\nNot working during the year might be concerning. If she's not employed, she could face unemployment issues which can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other services that don't provide long-term solutions.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse problems, which can contribute to recidivism if not addressed properly.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While mental health issues can sometimes be linked to substance use, this factor alone doesn't directly point towards higher risk unless there's a history or other signs of depression.\n\nHer early life was in a household of five with her adoptive parents in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment might have had both positive and negative effects, but without knowing if she has any support system now, it's hard to assess how that impacts her risk.\n\nShe believes God doesn't affect her personal life. This could be a sign of lack of religious support or spirituality, which some studies suggest can help with substance use and mental health issues, so this might not directly contribute to higher risk but could influence her coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are high (medium/high), drug use is present (high), unemployment status (low-medium depending on the job market; if she's actively seeking, maybe low). The other factors don't seem to add significant risk. So overall, I'd lean towards a medium-high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of five prior convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as each conviction can lead to similar outcomes and potential supervision violations.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years indicates ongoing or recent substance abuse, which is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can impede job prospects and contribute to unstable living situations.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment Status\", \"low\", \"Not working during the year may suggest potential unemployment issues, but without specific information on job market conditions or actively seeking employment, this factor alone does not strongly indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, but without additional context about social support networks, it is difficult to definitively assess its impact on recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
