    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a solid indicator of past criminal behavior, which usually means higher recidivism risk. So that's high.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 135 lbs. I don't think height or weight directly affect recidivism much unless there's something about his physical health, but he doesn't have any other health issues mentioned here. So maybe this is low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, which might help with reintegration, so that could be a lower risk factor. Maybe medium? Or perhaps it's not directly related to recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education level often correlates with lower recidivism because people with higher education are more likely to have better job opportunities and support systems. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to dependency issues and higher chances of engaging in criminal activities again, so that's definitely high.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently felt down for months without anything to cheer him up. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential relapse or continued substance use, which can contribute to further crimes. So this is high.\n\nYoung age at 18 with a criminal history suggests he might be impulsive or have less life experience compared to older individuals, increasing the risk. High again.\n\nHe lived in a household of six from a young age in a rural area. That's a large family size, which could mean lack of individual attention and emotional support, potentially leading to higher recidivism. So high.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe in God and feels his life is under control. This might indicate a lack of religious guidance or support, which can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors. However, it's a bit more nuanced because some individuals without religious support still manage their lives well. Maybe medium here.\n\nPutting all these together: high due to multiple factors like past convictions, drug use, unemployment, and living situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of criminal behavior with three prior arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Not holding a job during the past year can lead to dependency issues and increased risk of engaging in criminal activities again.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"high\", \"Heavy drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years, along with feelings of low motivation or hopelessness, suggests potential for relapse or further substance abuse which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age in a large household in a rural area may indicate limited emotional support and individual attention, potentially increasing risk but not as directly as other factors like drug use or lack of education.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
