    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. I know there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe that doesn't directly affect her risk right now. But it's something to consider.\n\nShe has one arrest and no conviction. That's not a lot of history, so probably low risk from past convictions. But she was arrested once before, which might indicate some underlying issues.\n\nHer height is 5'6\" and weight 110 lbs. Not sure how that factors in unless there's something about her health or behavior related to weight, but nothing jumps out at me here.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse. Stability from a relationship can be positive for recidivism, so maybe low risk because she has support.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level is usually linked to lower recidivism since more education can lead to better job opportunities and stable lives. So that's a good sign.\n\nShe held two jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs shows responsibility and ability to manage finances, which are positive indicators for not reoffending.\n\nNo drug use in past four years. Drug abuse is a major factor in recidivism, so this is definitely low risk.\n\nHer mood: she felt down sometimes but nothing too serious. Maybe she's dealing with stress or other issues, but it doesn't directly correlate to higher risk unless there's more to her mental health situation.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with her biological mother in an urban area. Larger households can sometimes lead to more stress and less stability, which might increase risk factors like substance abuse or neglect. Urban areas might have different social dynamics that could contribute to issues.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious beliefs can influence behavior; some people use religion as a coping mechanism but others might engage in risky behaviors out of belief rather than reality. Not sure how strong this is as a risk factor, but it's something to consider.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors that are positive (education, stable living situation, job experience) outweigh the negative ones (past arrest, household size). The lack of conviction and no drug use are significant mitigators. The only concern might be her family environment, but without more info on specific issues there, I think overall she's low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Racial background\", \"low\", \"Racial identity can influence behavior, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, it doesn't directly affect current risk.\"),\n    (\"One non-convicted arrest\", \"low\", \"Past non-convicted arrests are typically not significant risk factors without underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight\", \"low\", \"No direct impact on recidivism risk based on physical attributes.\"),\n    (\"Married living with spouse\", \"low\", \"Stability from a relationship is generally protective against reoffending.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma, not in college\", \"low\", \"Education level is associated with lower recidivism due to better job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Two jobs held during the year\", \"low\", \"Multiple job experience indicates responsibility and financial stability.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Substance abuse is a major risk factor, but this absence is positive.\"),\n    (\"Mood: felt down sometimes\", \"low\", \"Mental health issues can vary and aren't directly linked to higher risk without more context.\"),\n    (\"Household of five with biological mother in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Larger households may experience stress or neglect contributing to risk factors like substance abuse or neglect.\"),\n    (\"Believes in God\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but without specific risky behaviors, it's a neutral factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
