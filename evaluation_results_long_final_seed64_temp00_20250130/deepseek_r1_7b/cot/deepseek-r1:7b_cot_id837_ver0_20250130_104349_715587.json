    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 18-year-old male rearrest based on his background. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an only child living alone. That might mean less support at home, which could be a red flag for dependency issues or emotional isolation. So that's a medium risk factor because it's not the worst but definitely something to consider.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one prior conviction. That's a solid high risk because past convictions are strong indicators of future behavior and instability.\n\nHis height is 6'3\" and he weighs between 175-199 lbs, which puts him in the higher end of the normal weight range for his height. Being overweight can lead to health issues that might affect his ability to manage substance use or other factors. So this is a medium risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone again\u2014so he's an only child now. That could mean he's not getting the support he once had, which might increase stress and dependency on substances. Medium risk here too.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is a big factor; without it, he might have fewer opportunities and could turn to substance use as a coping mechanism. High risk because not completing education can lead to unstable situations.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year\u2014so he has some income but maybe limited economic stability. Unemployment or underemployment can contribute to substance abuse and other issues. Medium risk here, but it's still something to consider.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, particularly marijuana. He's using drugs which can lead to health problems and self-destructive behaviors. High risk because drug use is a strong indicator of potential for further issues.\n\nHe feels down most of the time now\u2014so he's experiencing significant mental health issues. This could affect his ability to manage substance use or other risks, making him more prone to recidivism. High risk due to ongoing mental health challenges.\n\nLiving in a household of five at a young age in a rural area with biological mother. That might have caused emotional neglect or abuse, which can lead to behavioral issues later on. High risk because of the family environment and potential trauma.\n\nHe believes in God but feels things are out of his control\u2014so he's dealing with a lot of internal conflict or lack of control. This could contribute to self-harm or substance use, increasing recidivism chances. High risk here as well.\n\nPutting it all together: He has multiple high-risk factors like prior criminal history, drug use, mental health issues, and unstable family environment. The education gap is a big one too. While some factors are medium, the combination of high ones makes me lean towards high confidence in predicting rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which indicates past behavior and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and dependency issues, contributing to emotional stress and substance use.\"),\n    (\"Overweight\", \"medium\", \"His weight category may indicate health risks that could influence substance use or other behavioral factors.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Employment\", \"medium\", \"Single status with limited employment may affect economic stability and contribute to self-destructive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance use, particularly marijuana, is a significant risk factor for further issues such as recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of depression or low mood can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Exposure to a large family in a rural area at a young age may indicate past emotional neglect, contributing to behavioral issues and substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
