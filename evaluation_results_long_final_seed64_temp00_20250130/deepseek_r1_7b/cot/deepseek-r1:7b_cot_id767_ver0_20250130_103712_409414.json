    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with three convictions. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nShe's only 5'5\" and weighs 140 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism, but it's not always straightforward. Without knowing her BMI or other health factors, I'm not sure how much this affects her risk compared to others with similar stats.\n\nLiving alone is another point. Being in a stable environment might help prevent isolation issues, which could lead to substance abuse or other problems. So maybe this isn't as high of a risk factor here.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma and hasn't gone to college. Educational barriers can contribute to recidivism because they might limit opportunities for better job prospects or skills that could aid in reintegration after incarceration. That's definitely a medium-high risk factor.\n\nShe has held two jobs, which is positive as employment can reduce recidivism by providing stability. So this isn't a strong risk factor but still contributes positively.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood could indicate substance abuse issues. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can lead to impulsive behaviors or self-harm, which might increase the chances of reoffending. That's a high risk factor.\n\nHer young age and living with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area suggest she might have experienced family dysfunction or trauma. This could contribute to behavioral issues that might escalate upon release. So this is another high risk factor.\n\nConsidering her religious beliefs, while it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, it's possible that her spirituality could provide support and reduce stressors, which might lower the risk a bit. However, without more information on how she applies this belief to daily life, I'm not sure if this mitigates the risk enough.\n\nPutting all these together: three prior convictions (high), lack of education (medium-high), drug use (high), living situation (high), and young age with family background issues (high). The positive factors are employment (low) and possible spiritual support (low). \n\nThe high number of risk factors suggests a high probability of rearrest. Even though some factors might mitigate, the overall assessment leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Three prior convictions significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior and reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium-high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities for better job prospects and skills, contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years, especially marijuana, indicates potential substance abuse issues that may lead to impulsive behaviors or self-harm.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to behavioral issues and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs during the year provides some stability but does not directly correlate with reduced recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Religiosity\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of three in a rural area, along with religious beliefs, may indicate family dysfunction or stressors that could impact behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
