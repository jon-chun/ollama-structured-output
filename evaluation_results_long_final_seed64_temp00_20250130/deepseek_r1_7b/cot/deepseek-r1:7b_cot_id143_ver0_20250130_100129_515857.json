    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White. I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues in the justice system affecting her, but since it's not mentioned, maybe it's low weight.\n\nShe has one arrest and no conviction. That's minor, so probably low risk from that alone.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 155 lbs. Not sure how that affects risk; maybe she's underweight or something? Maybe low impact.\n\nLiving alone with no kids\u2014she's an adult living independently. No kids usually don't contribute to recidivism, so probably low.\n\nBachelor's degree not in college now. She has education but isn't furthering it. Some argue higher education reduces recidivism, but she's already got a bachelor's, so maybe medium risk here?\n\nUsed drugs: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's significant. Drug use is a strong indicator of substance abuse which can lead to more criminal behavior or higher risk factors.\n\nSome drug use in the past month\u2014severe mood swings. Mood issues could affect decision-making, possibly leading to more impulsive crimes. Medium-high here.\n\nYoung age and living with both parents at a young age in an urban area. Urban environments might have different social dynamics, maybe higher stress or exposure to crime. Also, early experiences can influence behavior; not sure how much that affects recidivism specifically though.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with her life\u2014might indicate a lack of religious support, which could be a risk factor if she's more likely to turn to other substances or have unstable relationships.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use is a big red flag. She's in an urban area where that might correlate with higher crime rates. Her living situation and young age might contribute indirectly but not as strongly. Education-wise, having a bachelor's degree could mitigate some risk, but she's still at 22, which is early to have significant recidivism issues.\n\nSo overall, I think her risk is high because of the drug use and past experiences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Her being 22 years old and living alone may contribute indirectly but not strongly to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"She has a history of drug use, which is a significant indicator of potential substance abuse leading to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mood Swings and Impulsivity\", \"medium-high\", \"Her recent mood swings could lead to impulsive decisions that might result in further criminal acts.\"),\n    (\"Early Exposure and Urban Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in an urban area may have some influence but is not a strong risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a bachelor's degree without further education could slightly mitigate recidivism risks, but it doesn't negate them completely.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
