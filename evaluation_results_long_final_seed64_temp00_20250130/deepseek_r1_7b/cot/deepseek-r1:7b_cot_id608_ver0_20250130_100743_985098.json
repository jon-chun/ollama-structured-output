    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times and convicted. That's a solid indicator of past criminal behavior, which usually means higher risk. So that's high risk because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs 120 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism studies, but since she's young and doesn't have any other health issues mentioned, I don't think this is significant enough to change the risk assessment here. So maybe low or medium? Hmm, probably medium because being underweight isn't necessarily a strong indicator without more context.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence recidivism rates, but since she's young and not in a committed relationship, I don't see a direct link to higher rearrest risk here. Maybe low or medium? Not sure yet.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor; lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can limit opportunities and lead to unstable situations. So this should be high risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Unemployment for that long might indicate some instability, but having multiple jobs could also show adaptability. However, if she's been unemployed or underemployed, that could increase risk. Since she has three jobs, maybe medium? But I'm not certain; it depends on her job stability and income.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug abuse is a strong indicator of substance misuse, which can lead to more criminal behavior or increased risk factors like using drugs while driving. So this should be high risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, recent lack of depression might not directly affect her rearrest risk unless there's a history of mental illness. Since she doesn't mention it, maybe medium or low? Not sure yet.\n\nYoung age and living with her biological mother in a household of three at a young age could indicate family environment factors that might influence behavior, but without more info on family dynamics or support, I'm not certain how this affects the risk. Maybe low to medium?\n\nShe believes in God's role in her life. Religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates if they provide guidance and structure, but it's a personal factor and doesn't directly indicate higher risk. So maybe low.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior convictions (high), lack of education (high), drug use (high). The other factors don't add much unless the drug use is severe or recent. So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests and convictions which are strong indicators of past criminal behavior and increased likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education or GED, combined with not currently enrolled in college, is a significant factor correlated with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities and potential for unstable situations.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine over the past four years can lead to substance misuse, which often correlates with increased risk of criminal behavior or impaired judgment leading to further issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs may indicate some stability but could also suggest underemployment or potential for job loss, which might contribute indirectly to risk factors if there's instability in the future.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at a young age without significant family support can sometimes be associated with lower recidivism rates due to reduced opportunities for substance abuse and increased supervision, though this is context-dependent.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Recent lack of depression may not directly affect risk unless there's a history of mental health issues which could influence behavior patterns.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
