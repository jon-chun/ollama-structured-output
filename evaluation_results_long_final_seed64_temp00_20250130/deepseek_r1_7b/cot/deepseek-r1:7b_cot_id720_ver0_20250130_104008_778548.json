    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested seven times and convicted. That's a lot! Recidivism is higher with more prior convictions because she's already had trouble fitting in or dealing with the system before. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 115 lbs. Her weight might be below average, but I don't think height or BMI directly affects recidivism unless there's something about her health, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe this factor is low to medium.\n\nHer marital status: she's never been married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might increase stress or substance use, both of which could contribute to recidivism. But since she's not married yet, it's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because people might turn to criminal activities as a way to make ends meet or escape necessity. So this is definitely high risk.\n\nNumber of jobs held: she's held two jobs during the year. Having some income can help reduce dependency on illegal activities, so maybe this lowers her risk a bit. But it's not a strong indicator alone.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially cannabis, isn't as severe as hard drugs but can still have negative consequences and might lead to other issues that could affect her ability to reintegrate into society. So this is medium risk.\n\nMental health: she hasn't felt depressed over the past month. No mention of mental health issues here, so maybe this factor doesn't contribute much either way. It's probably low or neutral.\n\nUpbringing: at a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment can sometimes lead to emotional neglect or abuse, which might have long-term effects on her behavior and likelihood of reoffending. So this is medium risk.\n\nReligion: she believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religious factors can influence behavior but without specific issues, it's hard to say how much they affect recidivism. It might be low or neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are the biggest red flag here\u2014seven times is a lot. Education and lack of employment are also significant. Her living situation in a rural area with her mother could imply some stressors, but not sure if that's directly related to recidivism. Drug use is present but maybe not severe enough yet.\n\nI think overall, the high prior convictions and education issues would push her into a high risk category for rearrest. The other factors might temper it a bit, but the main ones are still pointing towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has been convicted seven times, indicating significant past involvement in the criminal system which increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and potential stressors that may indirectly affect her ability to reintegrate into society, though not a direct indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not being enrolled in college correlates with higher recidivism rates due to increased reliance on criminal activities as a means of survival or escape.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs during the year may provide some stability, reducing dependency on illegal activities which could lower her risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use can have negative consequences and may contribute to other issues that affect her ability to reintegrate into society.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing in a Rural Household\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a rural household of three could imply emotional neglect or abuse, which might influence long-term behavior but is not directly tied to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God may influence behavior positively, though without specific issues, it's hard to quantify its effect on recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
