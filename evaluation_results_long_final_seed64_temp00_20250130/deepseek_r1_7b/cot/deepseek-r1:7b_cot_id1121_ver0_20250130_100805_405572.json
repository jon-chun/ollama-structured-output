    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male having rearrest within three years. He's Black, hasn't been convicted yet but has an arrest, so maybe there's some residual criminal history despite not being convicted. His age is quite young, which might mean he's still developing skills and relationships.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, which could affect his stability. No high school diploma or GED means he might have less educational support, possibly hindering job opportunities. He hasn't worked during the year, so no income to rely on, which can make reintegration tough.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive, but past behavior shouldn't be the only factor. His lack of religious affiliation could influence his motivation towards change or self-reliance. Growing up in a household of five with an urban background might have shaped his experiences; maybe he's seen family issues or community challenges that could affect him now.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think there are some signs but not overwhelming ones. Maybe medium risk because while he has some positive traits like no drug use and age, the lack of education, employment, and living alone could be significant negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which may indicate a period of development where risk factors might be present but not necessarily high.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"He has one arrest but no conviction, suggesting potential residual criminal tendencies that could influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"low\", \"Not working during the year could indicate financial instability and reduced ability to support himself.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse increases instability, which can be a contributing factor in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is positive but should not be the sole determinant of risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a household of five may have provided some exposure to family issues, which could influence behavior but doesn't necessarily indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"religion affiliation\", \"low\", \"Non-affiliation with God might affect motivation towards positive change or self-reliance but isn't directly indicative of criminal tendencies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
