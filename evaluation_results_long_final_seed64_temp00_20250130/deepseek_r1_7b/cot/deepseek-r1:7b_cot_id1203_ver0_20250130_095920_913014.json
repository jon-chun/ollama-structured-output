    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. He has a history of four arrests and two convictions. That's a significant criminal history right there. Age-wise, he's pretty young, which might mean he's still developing his skills or perhaps hasn't had much life experience to build a solid support system.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so no one to rely on for emotional support during tough times. His educational background is limited\u2014he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That could mean he might struggle with job opportunities or staying on track with his goals, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's only held one job recently, so maybe he's had trouble finding stable employment before. Unemployment for that long without support can lead to dependency issues, making him more prone to relapse after incarceration.\n\nHis substance use history is a red flag too. He used marijuana in the past four years and felt really down recently. Drug use can impair judgment, affect relationships, and increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors while incarcerated.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area might have shaped his personality or provided him with certain experiences that could either help or hinder him now. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more stressors, which can contribute to negative outcomes.\n\nHis religious belief is mentioned as something he considers important, but I'm not sure how that plays into his risk of recidivism. Some people find solace in religion, while others might struggle with it if it causes significant distress or conflict in their life.\n\nPutting all this together: His criminal history is a strong indicator of past issues. Living alone and lack of support mean he's isolated, which can lead to emotional strain. Limited education and job experience suggest instability. Substance use adds another layer of risk. The urban environment might contribute to stressors. All these factors point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n\nI think the confidence level should be quite high because so many factors are pointing in that direction. Maybe around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with four arrests and two convictions, indicating past problematic behavior and potential for continued misconduct.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse places him in an isolated environment, which may contribute to emotional distress and increased vulnerability to stressors.\"),\n    (\"Educational Background\", \"low\", \"Limited educational attainment (no high school diploma or GED) and not currently enrolled in college suggest instability and potential difficulty achieving long-term goals that could aid in reintegration and deterrence.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Only holding one job recently may indicate past unemployment, which can lead to dependency issues and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors post-incarceration.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Heavy use of marijuana and recent feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues that can impair judgment, relationships, and overall well-being, increasing the risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of five with his biological mother in an urban area may have exposed him to higher crime rates and stressors common in such environments, potentially contributing to negative outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"While he considers religion important, the lack of specific mention of distress or conflict suggests it may not significantly impact his current risk factors but could be a minor consideration if relevant issues arise.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
