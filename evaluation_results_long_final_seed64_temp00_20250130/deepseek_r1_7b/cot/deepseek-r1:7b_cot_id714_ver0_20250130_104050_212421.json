Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a GED and is in college. That's usually a positive sign because education can lead to better job opportunities and maybe less involvement in the criminal system. So that might be low risk.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can have long-term consequences on her ability to function and could affect her relationships or studies, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe felt down during some of the past month; maybe she's struggling with mental health issues. That could impact her motivation and decision-making, which might increase her risk a bit\u2014so medium again.\n\nLiving alone at 18 is common for young women, but it can sometimes mean less supervision and support, so that's another low factor.\n\nShe has a history of living with both parents in a household of four. That was a sheltered environment, which usually isn't bad, but maybe the stress from being in such a large family could affect her independence or self-esteem\u2014so perhaps medium risk there.\n\nConsidering all these factors: education and college are positive, drug use is moderate, living alone might be low to medium depending on context, and past family environment also contributes. I think overall, she's at a slightly higher risk than not, but maybe not extremely high.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor:\n\n- **Drug Use**: Medium - Past four years of drug use can impact future behavior and stability.\n- **Mental Health**: Medium - Recent feelings of low mood may affect decision-making or motivation.\n- **Living Alone**: Low - While living alone is common, it might offer some independence but could also be isolating.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the prediction leans towards a higher risk. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Her past four years of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) may indicate ongoing substance abuse which can affect her ability to function and make decisions in the future.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"She has felt so down recently that nothing could cheer her up, suggesting possible underlying mental health issues that might influence her behavior or choices.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 18 is common but may offer some independence; however, it can also lead to isolation and potential stress from a large household environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
