    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I need to determine the relative weight of each risk factor for a 20-year-old White female who has been arrested once but not convicted. She's 5'7\" with a weight between 150-174 lbs, living alone without a spouse, has a high school diploma, holds four jobs, uses marijuana, hasn't felt depressed in the past month, and lived with both parents in a rural household of five. She believes God isn't involved in her life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors from the examples provided to understand their impact on rearrest recidivism.\n\n1. **Arrests**: She has one arrest but no conviction. The examples show that having arrests can be a significant factor. For instance, someone with multiple arrests is more likely to reoffend. Since she's only arrested once, this might not be as severe as multiple offenses, but it still counts.\n\n2. **Age**: 20 years old. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and decision-making. The examples include several cases with similar ages, so her age could contribute to a higher risk.\n\n3. **Weight**: She weighs between 150-174 lbs. Being in the lower weight category might indicate she's underweight or maybe she's at a healthy weight. However, weight alone isn't a direct indicator of recidivism without considering other factors like health issues or substance use.\n\n4. **Marital Status**: She's living alone and never married. Single individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they might not have the support system to seek help or stay sober. This could be a high-risk factor.\n\n5. **Education Level**: She has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can influence recidivism; having a diploma might suggest she's motivated, but not attending college could mean she lacks further skills or support.\n\n6. **Employment**: She's held four jobs during the year. Employment, especially full-time, is usually linked to lower recidivism because it provides stability and economic independence. Having multiple jobs should be a mitigating factor.\n\n7. **Drug Use**: She has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, particularly marijuana, can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing the risk of reoffending. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\n8. **Depression**: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While some recidivists experience periods of depression, not feeling it might indicate better mental health, which could be a positive sign.\n\n9. **Household Environment**: She lived with both biological parents in a household of five in a rural area. Living with family can provide support and resources, potentially reducing the risk of recidivism. However, the rural setting might have limited access to support services.\n\n10. **Belief in God**: She considers God has nothing to do with her life. Religious beliefs can influence behavior; if she doesn't believe in a higher power, she might be more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors that could lead to recidivism.\n\nNow, assigning weights based on these factors:\n\n- **Arrests (1)**: Medium - One arrest is significant but not as severe as multiple offenses.\n- **Age (2)**: High - Young age typically correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n- **Weight (3)**: Low - Not a direct indicator without other factors like health or substance use.\n- **Marital Status (4)**: Medium to High - Living alone and not married can increase risk due to lack of support.\n- **Education (5)**: Medium - Having a diploma but not continuing education might have mixed effects.\n- **Employment (6)**: Low - Employment, especially full-time, is usually protective.\n- **Drug Use (7)**: High - Drug use, particularly marijuana, can increase risk.\n- **Depression (8)**: Medium - Not feeling depressed isn't necessarily a strong mitigating factor.\n- **Household Environment (9)**: Medium - Family living but in a rural area might have its own challenges.\n- **Belief in God (10)**: High - Lack of religious involvement can correlate with riskier behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high-risk indicators are her age, drug use, and belief in God. These three factors significantly influence her likelihood of rearrest. The medium factors include arrests, marital status, education, and household environment. Employment is a positive mitigating factor but not enough to offset the others.\n\nPutting it all together, despite having employment and a diploma, these high-risk factors point towards a higher probability of recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"Medium\", \"She has one arrest which can be significant but not as severe as multiple offenses.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"High\", \"Young age typically correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"Low\", \"Not a direct indicator without other factors like health or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"Medium to High\", \"Living alone and not married can increase risk due to lack of support.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"Medium\", \"Having a diploma but not continuing education might have mixed effects.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"Low\", \"Employment, especially full-time, is usually protective.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"High\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"Medium\", \"Not feeling depressed isn't necessarily a strong mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Household Environment\", \"Medium\", \"Family living but in a rural area might have its own challenges.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"High\", \"Lack of religious involvement can correlate with riskier behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"rearrest_recidivism\": \"High\"\n}\n```",
