    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. The person in question is a 19-year-old female Black individual with several risk factors.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the provided information and then analyze each risk factor one by one.\n\n**Case Details:**\n- Age: 19 years old\n- Race: Black\n- Arrests: 1 time but not convicted\n- Weight: 160 lbs\n- Height: 5 feet 6 inches\n- Marital Status: Never married, currently living alone\n- Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college\n- Employment: Held no jobs during the year\n- Drug Use: No use in past four years\n- Depression: Not felt in past month\n- Childhood Home: Lived with biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area\n- Belief in God: Nothing to do with personal experiences\n\n**Risk Factors from Examples:**\nLooking at the provided examples, I need to assign weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor. The examples show how different factors like prior convictions, age, weight, etc., influence rearrest rates.\n\n1. **Prior Arrests:** The person has 1 arrest but not convicted. From example #28, someone with similar factors had a YES outcome, suggesting that even one non-convicted arrest can be a significant risk factor.\n   - Weight: High\n\n2. **Age:** Being 19 is quite young, which might indicate she's still developing and could face more challenges.\n   - Weight: Medium (since it's relevant but not as critical as prior arrests)\n\n3. **Weight:** She weighs 160 lbs, which is slightly below average for her age. From example #28, weight was a high factor contributing to YES.\n   - Weight: High\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Alone:** Being single and living alone can increase vulnerability to stressors.\n   - Weight: Medium (as per example #10)\n\n5. **Education Level:** She has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Lower education is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n   - Weight: High\n\n6. **Employment:** No jobs during the year, which can affect financial stability and support network.\n   - Weight: High (as seen in example #28)\n\n7. **Drug Use:** She hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive indicator.\n   - Weight: Low (since no use reduces risk)\n\n8. **Depression:** She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, indicating good mental health.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n9. **Childhood Home Environment:** Lived with her mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. From example #26, living with family can be protective but size and environment matter.\n   - Weight: Medium (household size was medium in some examples)\n\n10. **Belief in God:** She considers God has nothing to do with her personal experiences, which might indicate a lack of religious support system.\n    - Weight: Low\n\n**Assigning Weights:**\n- Prior Arrests: High\n- Age: Medium\n- Weight: High\n- Marital Status/Living Alone: Medium\n- Education: High\n- Employment: High\n- Drug Use: Low\n- Depression: Low\n- Childhood Home: Medium\n- Belief in God: Low\n\n**Calculating the Overall Risk:**\nAdding up the high-weight factors (prior arrests, weight, education, employment) and medium ones (age, marital status, childhood home). The low factors don't contribute much. High factors significantly increase the risk.\n\nConsidering that she has no recent drug use or depression but other factors like age, weight, and education are concerning, her overall risk is moderately high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"High\", \"The individual has one non-convicted arrest which can be a significant risk factor for recidivism as seen in similar cases where such factors led to rearrest outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"Her age of 19 may indicate she is still developing and could face more challenges that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"High\", \"She weighs 160 lbs, which is slightly below average for her age, a factor linked to higher recidivism rates as shown in relevant examples.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone can increase vulnerability to stressors, contributing to potential recidivism risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"High\", \"Having only a high school diploma without college enrollment is associated with higher recidivism rates as per previous data points.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"High\", \"Holding no jobs during the year can affect financial stability and support network, which are critical for reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"Low\", \"Not using drugs in four years reduces her risk of drug-related offenses contributing to recidivism as seen in similar cases.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"Low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month indicates good mental health, which is protective against recidivism factors.\"),\n    (\"Childhood Home Environment\", \"Medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban household of three may offer some protective elements but also has potential vulnerabilities.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"Low\", \"Not considering God as part of her personal support system may influence her decision-making and community involvement which can affect recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"High\"\n}\n```",
