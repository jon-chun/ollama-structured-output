    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor and assigning a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female with mixed race. She has been arrested 5 times and convicted. That's a significant number of convictions; I know that more prior offenses can increase the likelihood of rearrest. So this factor should have a high weight because it's a strong indicator of recidivism.\n\nShe's currently living alone, which might suggest she doesn't have immediate support or help in finding employment or avoiding criminal behavior. This could be a medium factor since living alone isn't directly related to recidivism but can contribute indirectly by affecting her ability to find resources.\n\nHer weight is between 150 and 174 lbs, which is within the normal range for her age. I don't see an immediate connection between body weight and recidivism, so this might be a low factor unless there's other information about health or related issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence future opportunities, but not having a degree doesn't necessarily directly lead to rearrest. It could be considered a medium factor if we consider that some employers require higher education, but it's not a direct cause.\n\nHolding no jobs during the year means she might lack income and stability, which are risk factors for both getting and staying in trouble. This should have a high weight because unemployment is a known predictor of recidivism.\n\nShe has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can lead to health issues, legal problems, and strained relationships, all of which contribute to higher chances of rearrest. This factor definitely has a high weight.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month might indicate she's mentally stable, but if she's been dealing with substance abuse or other issues, this could be a medium factor since it's positive but doesn't directly correlate without more context.\n\nLiving with her adoptive parents in a household of five in a rural area suggests she has support from family. While having family can help reduce stress and provide resources, living in a rural area might mean fewer opportunities for employment or community support, which could be a medium factor depending on the surrounding environment's influence.\n\nConsidering that she believes God has no role in her personal events points to potential spirituality issues or lack of religious guidance. This might affect her motivation towards positive behavior but isn't directly tied to recidivism unless there are other underlying issues not mentioned here.\n\nNow, putting it all together: high prior convictions, living alone, no job, drug use\u2014all these factors point towards a high risk of rearrest. The positive factors like education and family support might slightly mitigate the risk, but given her history, I would lean towards a high confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant number of prior arrests (5 times) and convictions, which is a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can contribute to isolation and may affect access to resources or support, but it is not directly linked to recidivism without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Weight Range\", \"low\", \"Her weight falls within the normal range for her age; no direct connection to recidivism based on this factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma and not pursuing further education may limit future opportunities but does not directly correlate with rearrest risk without additional context about employability.\"),\n    (\"Joblessness\", \"high\", \"Not holding any jobs during the year indicates potential instability, which is a known predictor of both initial arrest and rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine increases the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities, contributing to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed may suggest some level of mental stability, but without context on underlying issues like substance abuse, it is a medium factor.\"),\n    (\"Family Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with family in a rural area provides support but the rural environment might limit opportunities and community resources, affecting rearrest risk indirectly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
