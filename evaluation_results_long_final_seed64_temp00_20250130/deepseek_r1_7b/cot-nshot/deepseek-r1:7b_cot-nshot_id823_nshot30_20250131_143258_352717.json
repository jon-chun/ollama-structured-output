    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who's White. She has been arrested 3 times and convicted. That's a high number of prior convictions, which definitely increases the risk of recidivism. Prior convictions are usually a strong indicator because they show a history of breaking the law, making it more likely she'll do it again.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse. Living in a stable environment can be protective against recidivism compared to living alone or with other relatives who might not provide support. So this factor might have a lower weight.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level, especially completing high school, is associated with lower recidivism rates because it often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. Not being enrolled might mean she's looking for more education, which could be positive, so maybe medium weight.\n\nShe held 1 job during the year. Having a job can provide income and stability, reducing the likelihood of needing to rely on other sources of support or facing unemployment-induced issues. So this factor is probably low to medium in weight.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent or frequent use, can impair judgment and decision-making, making reoffending more likely. This should be a high-weight factor.\n\nFeeling down or depressed for some of the month: Emotional distress can lead to substance abuse, poor decisions, and increased risk of criminal behavior. This is another high-weight factor because it's directly related to mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nHousehold size at young age was 6 with adults other than biological parents. Larger households might offer more support but in this case, since she's living with non-biological parents, it's possible they might not be as supportive or stable, which could increase risk. So medium weight here.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with her personal issues: This is a bit tricky because it suggests she may have underlying mental health issues or religious coping mechanisms that could either help or hurt. However, if she believes in God for personal issues, it might indicate she's seeking support but not necessarily directly influencing recidivism risk. Maybe low weight.\n\nPutting this all together, the high number of prior convictions (3) is a major red flag. The drug use and depression are significant factors that would increase the likelihood of rearrest. Even though she's married and has a diploma, these other factors might outweigh them enough to predict a \"YES\" outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 3 prior convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as past criminal behavior is often indicative of future criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living with her spouse provides a stable living environment, which can be protective against recidivism compared to other living arrangements.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"While she has a high school diploma, not being enrolled in college might indicate a desire for further education, which could positively influence stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held one job during the year suggests some level of employment stability, which can contribute to financial independence and reduced reliance on criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress/Depression\", \"high\", \"Feeling down or depressed for part of the month can lead to substance abuse and poor decisions, both of which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 6 with non-biological parents might not provide adequate support, potentially increasing risk compared to smaller households but without direct evidence of instability.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs and Personal Issues\", \"low\", \"Considering God has something to do with her personal issues may suggest she is seeking support, which could be a positive factor in reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
