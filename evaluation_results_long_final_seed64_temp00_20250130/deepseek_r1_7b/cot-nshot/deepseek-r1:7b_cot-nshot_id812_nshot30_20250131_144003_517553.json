    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who's White. He has been arrested once and convicted. That's one arrest, which might indicate some prior trouble, but since it's only once, maybe not too bad. His weight is 185 lbs, which seems normal for his height of 5 feet 11 inches.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, so no family support system there. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, which is positive because education can lead to better job opportunities and outcomes. He's held two jobs during the year; having work experience might help with stability.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is great. No feelings of depression either, so mental health seems okay. At a young age, he lived with adults other than his biological parents in a household of four. That means he didn't have a stable home environment growing up, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal issues, which might indicate some level of religious support or belief, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism directly.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided earlier. In example 10, someone similar had high risk factors and was predicted NO. Example 28 had several low factors except for living with non-biological parents and was predicted YES. Hmm, so it's a bit mixed in the examples.\n\nI think the key factors here are the arrest history (one conviction), living situation (household size 4 with non-biological parents), lack of family support, education, job experience, and mental health. The high school diploma is positive, but the living arrangement might be a red flag.\n\nThe person has no drug use or depression issues, which are good signs. His belief in God might provide some stability, but it's not directly tied to recidivism data.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: one arrest, stable education and job experience, no substance abuse, no depression, but living with non-biological parents in a larger household. I think the risk is medium because while there are some negative points, they're mitigated by positive factors like education and employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest conviction, which could indicate past behavior that may influence future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of size 4 is a significant risk factor as it suggests instability and potential lack of family support which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma, while positive, does not directly correlate with reduced recidivism risk compared to other factors like living conditions or employment history.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Employed two jobs during the year, which can contribute to financial stability and reduce stress, mitigating but not eliminating risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"low\", \"No feelings of depression in the past month, indicating a stable mental state that could positively influence recidivism outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God has something to do with personal issues; while this may provide some support, it does not directly correlate with reduced recidivism risk compared to other factors like living conditions or employment history.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
