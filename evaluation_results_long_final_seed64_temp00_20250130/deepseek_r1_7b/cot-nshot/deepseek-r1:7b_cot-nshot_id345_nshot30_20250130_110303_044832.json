    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 20-year-old male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a clear sign of past criminal behavior, which usually increases the chance of rearrest. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 128 lbs. Weight isn't directly a crime-related factor here, but maybe his height is relevant? Not sure, so I'll note it as low relevance.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living situation can affect recidivism, but since he's not married, maybe it's less of an issue unless there are other factors like substance use or prior issues with the environment.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education level is important; having a diploma might indicate better job prospects, which could lower recidivism risk. But if he's not in college, maybe he's facing other challenges.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability, so that's a low to medium negative factor here.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct cause of rearrest, but it could be a sign of underlying issues or self-medicating for other problems.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a rural area at age 18. Living with family can provide support and stability, which might lower recidivism risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. This is more about his personal beliefs rather than criminal behavior or family environment.\n\nPutting it all together: The main factors are the prior arrest (high), education level (moderate positive), job history (low negative). The rest don't add much. So, considering these, I think he might have a moderate to low risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest and conviction which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior that can influence future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and_height\", \"low\", \"Age and height do not directly correlate with recidivism risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase or decrease recidivism risk without additional factors like substance use or unstable environments.\"),\n    (\"education_level_enrolled_college\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma and not enrolled in college may indicate some educational barriers but also potentially better job opportunities which could lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Holding 4 jobs during the year provides stability, which is generally protective against rearrest.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"low\", \"Drug use alone does not directly cause rearrest but may indicate substance abuse issues that could be related to recidivism if combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"household_size_rural_area\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a rural area at age 18 provides family support which can contribute to lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religion Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with personal events does not directly correlate with recidivism unless it indicates underlying issues like depression or substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
