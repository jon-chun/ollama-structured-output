    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old White female who was arrested once but not convicted. That's one arrest, which might indicate some prior issues, but since she wasn't convicted, maybe it's less severe than if she had a full sentence. She weighs 155 lbs and is 5'7\", so her weight isn't an issue here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone, which could mean she has fewer support systems around her. That might be a risk factor because living alone can lead to isolation and stressors that contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe completed a Bachelor's degree but isn't enrolled in college anymore. Education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates if it leads to better job opportunities, but since she's not actively learning, maybe her education level is stable but not increasing further.\n\nShe has held 4 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs might indicate good financial stability and work-life balance, which are positive factors for reducing recidivism. However, if she lost a job recently or faced challenges while working, that could be a concern. But since it's stated she's held 4 jobs, I'll assume steady employment.\n\nShe uses drugs like marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a strong risk factor because it can lead to unstable behavior, legal issues, and health problems, all of which increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nSome of the time during the past month she felt down, which might indicate stress or other underlying issues. Emotional distress could be linked to substance use and contribute to future problems.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of 4 in an urban area at a young age. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and social stressors, which are known risk factors for recidivism. Having multiple family members might provide support but also could mean living in a high-stress environment if the family isn't stable.\n\nShe believes God has no role in her personal events, which suggests she's likely influenced by secular values or external pressures rather than religious ones. This might not directly impact her behavior but could be part of her coping mechanisms.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: one arrest (low), living alone (medium risk because it can lead to isolation and stress), Bachelor's degree (low risk if stable), 4 jobs (positive), drug use (high risk), emotional distress (moderate), family background in an urban area (medium risk), and her personal beliefs (low impact). \n\nThe highest risks come from drug use, which is high. The other factors are either low or moderate. So the overall risk seems higher than average but not extremely so. However, since she has multiple jobs and a degree, these positive factors might balance out the negative ones.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, similar cases with high drug use and living alone had mixed outcomes, sometimes leading to recidivism. But in this case, her education and job stability could mitigate some of those risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (not convicted)\", \"low\", \"She was arrested once but not convicted, indicating minimal prior legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and stressors that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She completed a Bachelor's degree which is stable and could positively influence her future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"positive\", \"Held 4 jobs, suggesting good financial stability and work-life balance which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor linked to unstable behavior and legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"moderate\", \"Felt down during the past month, possibly due to stress or underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"Family Background in Urban Area\", \"medium\", \"Experienced living with both parents in a household of 4 in an urban area which may have higher stressors.\"),\n    (\"Personal Beliefs (God's influence)\", \"low\", \"Believes God has no role, suggesting coping mechanisms that may reduce external pressures.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
