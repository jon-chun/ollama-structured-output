    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm going to analyze each risk factor for the 20-year-old male identified as Asian/Pacific Islander.\n\nFirst, his age is 20, which is relatively young but he has a history of multiple arrests\u20143 convictions. That's a significant red flag because recidivism tends to increase with more prior offenses.\n\nHis weight and height are 5'7\" and 230 lbs. While this doesn't directly indicate anything about his behavior or mental health, it's worth noting that he's married but living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of instability, which might contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism because individuals with higher education may have better job opportunities and support systems. His lack of education could mean he's facing challenges that might lead him back into trouble.\n\nHe has held 2 jobs during the year, which is a positive sign as employment can reduce substance abuse and provide stability. However, since he's not currently employed, it's worth considering if there are underlying issues preventing him from working effectively.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but still feels down occasionally. While this suggests he might be managing his substances well, persistent feelings of low mood could indicate deeper mental health issues that aren't being addressed.\n\nLiving alone at 20 with a history of multiple arrests and substance use is concerning. Living in a household of size 11 seems unusual\u2014such large households can sometimes correlate with higher stress or neglect, which might contribute to recidivism if not properly addressed.\n\nHis belief in God could be a mitigating factor as religious support systems often provide guidance and stability, potentially reducing the likelihood of further criminal behavior. However, this alone isn't enough without addressing other risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, lack of education, living alone with an unusual household size, and persistent feelings of low mood are all concerning signs that could lead to rearrest within three years. While his religious belief is positive, the other factors point towards a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of multiple arrests (3 convictions), which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_education\", \"high\", \"The absence of a high school diploma or GED, coupled with not being enrolled in college, can hinder opportunities for positive development and stability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone_with_unusual_household_size\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 20 years old, especially in a household of size 11, may indicate instability or neglect which could contribute to higher recidivism risk if not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"persistent_mood Issues\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down occasionally can sometimes be a sign of deeper mental health issues that might not be adequately addressed, potentially leading to further behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"past_drug free_period\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs in the past four years could indicate better substance control and lower risk of related incidents, which is a positive mitigating factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
