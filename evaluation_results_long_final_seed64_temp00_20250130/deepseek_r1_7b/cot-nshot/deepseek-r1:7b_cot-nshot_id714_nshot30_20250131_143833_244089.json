    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old female. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18, which is quite young, but she's still considered an adult. Her criminal history: one arrest but not a conviction. That might be a medium risk because even though she has an arrest, it hasn't been resolved yet.\n\nShe weighs 135 lbs and is 5'2\". Her weight doesn't directly indicate much about her risk unless there are other factors related to her health or lifestyle, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability, so that might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Having a GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, which could reduce recidivism risk, but being in college might indicate she's motivated to change her situation.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Job experience can be positive if it shows responsibility, but without more info on the nature of the job or if it was stable, it's a bit low risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can contribute to recidivism. That would be a high risk factor.\n\nHer feelings of being down for some time might indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are also significant risk factors. High risk here.\n\nAt 18, she's at a stage where she might not have had much life experience yet, but her current situation\u2014arrested, living alone, using drugs\u2014suggests she's in a challenging spot. Her living with both parents as a child is positive, but now living alone could be a negative.\n\nConsidering God involvement: She believes in God affecting her personal issues, which might suggest she's motivated to change, possibly reducing risk. But it's subjective and varies from person to person.\n\nPutting this all together, the high risk factors are drug use and feelings of being down. The medium ones include age, living alone, and job experience. The positive is having a GED and being in college. However, the negative aspects like past arrest and current instability might pull it towards NO but with some influence from her educational background.\n\nI think overall, considering the high risk factors dominate, I would lean towards a NO prediction with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age is 18, which is young, but she's still considered an adult.
