    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old White female. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested 3 times and convicted. That's a high number of prior convictions, which definitely increases her chance of rearrest. Prior convictions are usually a strong indicator of recidivism.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 120 lbs. Her weight is below the typical BMI range for her height, so she might be underweight. Underweight individuals can sometimes face health issues that might contribute to substance use or other problems, which could lead to more rearrest.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Living alone doesn't necessarily directly correlate with recidivism, but it might indicate some level of social isolation, which could indirectly affect her ability to find support or resources.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of recidivism; those without education often have fewer opportunities and may engage in riskier behavior.\n\nShe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse, especially with both marijuana and cocaine, is a significant risk factor for substance use disorders, which can lead to further legal issues or other problems that might result in rearrest.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While some level of depression can be linked to recidivism, not feeling depressed doesn't necessarily negate her history; it's more about recent mental health than a complete absence.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of 3. Small households might offer less support or supervision, which could contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors as she grows older.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal issues. This belief can sometimes provide a sense of control or direction but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism; however, it's important to consider in the context of her history.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are high (3), substance abuse is present (marijuana and cocaine), lack of education, living alone, and a small household. These factors collectively point towards a higher risk of rearrest. The examples given show that cases with multiple prior offenses, substance use, and similar circumstances often result in YES outcomes.\n\nSo, considering all these high-risk factors, I'm leaning towards predicting a YES for her 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested 3 times and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Underweight Status\", \"medium\", \"Her weight is below the typical BMI for her height, potentially affecting health outcomes that might contribute to substance use or other issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"While living alone doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, it may indicate social isolation which could indirectly affect her ability to find support.\"),\n    (\"Educational Discontinuity\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college are known predictors of recidivism due to limited opportunities and resources.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years indicates ongoing substance abuse, which is a significant risk factor for further issues leading to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month doesn't negate her history; it's more about recent mental health than complete absence.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of size 3 might offer less supervision, contributing to risky behaviors as she grows older.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
