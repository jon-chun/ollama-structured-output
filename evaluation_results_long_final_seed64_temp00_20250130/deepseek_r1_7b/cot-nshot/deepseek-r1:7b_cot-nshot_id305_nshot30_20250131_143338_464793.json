    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for an 18-year-old male who is White, has been arrested twice but not convicted, is 5 feet 8 inches weighing between 150-174 lbs, living alone without a spouse, enrolled in school, has held one job, uses drugs (marijuana and cocaine), hasn't felt depressed recently, lived with both parents in an urban area at age young, and believes God influences his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list all the risk factors from the given case:\n\n1. Age: 18 years old\n2. Arrests: 2 times, not convicted\n3. Weight: 5'8\" (170cm), weight between 150-174 lbs (~68kg)\n4. Marital status: Never married, living alone\n5. Education: Enrolled in school but no degree or diploma\n6. Employment: Held 1 job during the year\n7. Drug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years\n8. Depression: No feelings of depression in past month\n9. Home environment: Lived with both parents in a household size 4, urban area\n10. Belief in God: Yes\n\nNow, I'll compare this case to the provided examples (Examples 1-30) to determine how each factor contributes to recidivism risk.\n\n1. **Age**: Younger individuals are generally at higher risk for rearrest as they may not have developed life skills yet.\n   - Weight: Low\n2. **Arrests**: 2 times, which is significant but not the most concerning unless it's a new offense or multiple offenses.\n   - Weight: Medium\n3. **Weight**: 170cm and ~68kg falls within the average range for this age group; no extreme BMI.\n   - Weight: Low\n4. **Marital status & Living situation**: Single, living alone can increase stress and dependency issues.\n   - Weight: Medium\n5. **Education**: Enrolled but no degree; lack of education might limit opportunities and contribute to recidivism.\n   - Weight: Medium\n6. **Employment**: Held 1 job; having some income can help with financial stability, but one job is minimal.\n   - Weight: Low\n7. **Drug use**: Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use is a strong indicator of substance abuse issues, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n   - Weight: High\n8. **Depression**: No recent feelings; while some drug use can lead to depression, not feeling it might mitigate slightly.\n   - Weight: Low\n9. **Home environment**: Lived with both parents in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and stress levels.\n   - Weight: Medium\n10. **Belief in God**: Believes in God; religious factors can influence behavior, but it's not directly linked to recidivism unless there are specific issues with sin or moral failing.\n\nNow, assigning weights based on the analysis:\n\n- Drug use (7) is the highest risk factor at High.\n- Age (1), Marital status (4), Education (5), Employment (6), and Home environment (9) are all Medium.\n- The rest are Low except for any that might be higher. Since none of the other factors seem to have a high impact, they remain Low.\n\nConsidering the recidivism prediction, drug use is a major red flag. Drug abuse often leads to unstable behavior, which can result in further offenses or substance-related issues contributing to rearrest. The individual's age and living situation also add to the risk despite not being the highest factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high weight on drug use suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest compared to other factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Low\", \"The person is 18 years old, which is relatively young and may be at higher risk for rearrest due to skill development issues.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"Medium\", \"Two arrests but not convicted; this could indicate potential for future offenses or substance abuse leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"Low\", \"5 feet 8 inches (~170cm) and weighs between 150-174 lbs (~68kg), which is within a normal range for this age group.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status & Living Situation\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse can increase stress and dependency issues, potentially leading to substance abuse or other issues contributing to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"Medium\", \"Currently enrolled in school but has no degree or diploma; lack of education may limit opportunities and contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"Low\", \"Held 1 job during the year; having some income can help with financial stability, but one job is minimal and may not provide sufficient support.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"High\", \"Has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years; substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to potential behavioral issues or dependency problems.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"Low\", \"No recent feelings of depression, but drug use can sometimes lead to depression; this may slightly mitigate the risk compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Home Environment\", \"Medium\", \"Lived with both parents in a household size 4 in an urban area, which may have higher crime rates and stress levels contributing to potential issues.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"Low\", \"Believes in God; religious factors can influence behavior but do not directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there are specific issues with sin or moral failing.\")\n  ],\n  \"recidivism_risk\": \"High\"\n}\n```",
