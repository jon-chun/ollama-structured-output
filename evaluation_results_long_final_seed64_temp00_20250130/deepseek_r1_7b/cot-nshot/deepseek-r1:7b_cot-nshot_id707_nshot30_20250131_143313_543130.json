    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for an 18-year-old male who is White, has been arrested 3 times with a conviction, is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 145 lbs, currently living alone without a spouse, enrolled in school, hasn't held any jobs during the year, uses drugs (marijuana and cocaine), hasn't felt depressed recently, lived in a household of size 5 at a young age, and believes God influences his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors from the given case:\n\n1. **Number of prior arrests**: 3 times.\n2. **Conviction status**: Convicted.\n3. **Age**: 18 years old.\n4. **Height**: 6 feet 2 inches (which is quite tall).\n5. **Weight**: 145 lbs (on the lower end for his height, which might indicate underweight or muscular build).\n6. **Marital status**: Never married and living alone.\n7. **Employment**: Not employed during the year.\n8. **Drug use**: Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use.\n9. **Mental health**: No recent feelings of depression.\n10. **Household size at young age**: 5 members.\n\nNow, I'll compare these factors to the examples provided earlier to determine their relative weights as risk factors for rearrest recidivism.\n\nFrom previous examples:\n\n- **High prior arrests**: In many cases where individuals have been arrested multiple times, especially with convictions, there's a higher likelihood of recidivism. The person here has 3 prior arrests, which is significant.\n  \n- **Drug use**: Both marijuana and cocaine are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. The presence of drug use in the past four years should be a high risk factor.\n\n- **Employment status**: Not working during the year can contribute to substance abuse issues or lack of stability, increasing the risk.\n\n- **Household size at young age**: Living with more family members might indicate a higher likelihood of substance abuse due to environment or family dynamics. However, in this case, it's 5 people, which is quite large but not as directly linked to recidivism as other factors like drug use.\n\nOther factors like age (18), being White, and belief in God don't seem to have a direct impact based on the examples provided.\n\nConsidering all these points:\n\n- **High prior arrests**: High risk factor because multiple convictions increase the chance of reoffending.\n- **Drug use**: High risk due to past marijuana and cocaine use.\n- **Employment status**: Medium risk since not working could lead to other issues but isn't as directly linked as drug use.\n\nHousehold size at young age might be a low or medium factor, but in this case, it's already considered part of the factors. However, compared to others like drug use and prior arrests, it's less significant.\n\nSo, assigning weights:\n\n- Prior arrests: High\n- Drug use: High\n- Employment: Medium\n\nHousehold size at young age might be a low or medium factor but isn't as impactful in this case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted for 3 prior arrests, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"The presence of marijuana and cocaine use in the past four years is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Not holding a job during the year may contribute to substance abuse or instability, increasing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
