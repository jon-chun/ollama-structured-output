    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I need to determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for an 18-year-old Hispanic male with several risk factors.\n\nFirst, his high number of arrests (6 times) and convictions indicate a history of substance abuse, which is a strong risk factor. That should be a high weight because it significantly increases the chance of rearrest.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which can contribute to isolation and potential substance use issues, so that's another medium-high risk factor.\n\nHis recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) shows ongoing substance abuse problems, making him more likely to relapse. That's definitely a high weight.\n\nNot being married and living alone might mean he doesn't have support, which is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's enrolled in school but hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment or lack of gainful employment can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism, so that's another high weight.\n\nFeeling down and not being able to cope could push him towards further substance use or other risky behaviors, which is also a high risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area might offer some support, but urban environments can sometimes be isolating. That's a medium risk factor.\n\nConsidering he doesn't believe in God, which might affect his motivation to change, that's a low weight because it reduces the likelihood of seeking help or changing behavior.\n\nPutting all these together, the high number of prior convictions and current substance use issues are the most significant factors. The other factors contribute but aren't as impactful. Combining these, I'm leaning towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 6 times and convicted, indicating a history of substance abuse which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone may contribute to isolation and potential substance use issues but does not directly indicate a high risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a strong indicator of ongoing substance abuse issues that can lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"medium\", \"Not holding any jobs during the year may contribute to substance use as a coping mechanism but does not directly indicate a high risk of relapse.\"),\n    (\"Mental state\", \"high\", \"Feeling down and unable to cope may push him towards further substance use or risky behaviors, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in an urban area might offer some support but urban environments can sometimes be isolating which could affect his motivation to change behavior.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Does not consider God as a factor in his personal decisions, which may reduce his likelihood of seeking help or changing behavior related to substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
