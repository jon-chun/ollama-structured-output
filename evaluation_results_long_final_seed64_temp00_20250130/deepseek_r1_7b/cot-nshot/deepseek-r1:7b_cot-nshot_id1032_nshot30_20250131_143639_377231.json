    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor and assigning a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female of mixed race. She's been arrested once but not convicted. Her age might be a consideration since younger individuals can sometimes have different recidivism rates, but she's fairly young at 22. \n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marital status can influence recidivism; being in a stable relationship might reduce the likelihood of reoffending. So that could be a low risk factor.\n\nHer weight is 124 lbs, which is below average for her height (5'6\"). Underweight individuals sometimes have higher rates of certain health issues, but I'm not sure how that directly affects recidivism. Maybe it's more about overall health or socioeconomic factors related to weight. This might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a strong predictor of recidivism; without education, she may face barriers to employment and reintegration into society. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which means she's unemployed or underemployed. Unemployment can lead to stress, substance abuse, or other issues that might contribute to recidivism. High risk here.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but still feels down and can't cheer herself up. Emotional distress without substance use might indicate underlying mental health issues, which could increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior. Medium to high risk based on this.\n\nHer household size at a young age was 4. Larger households sometimes have different dynamics that could affect her stability or support system, but since she's now married and living with her spouse, it's less relevant. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nShe considers God as having no influence on her personal life. This might relate to her mental health or self-perception; if she doesn't believe in a higher power, she might face different coping mechanisms for stress or emotional issues. Medium risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: She has some positive factors like being married and not having a high school diploma. However, the lack of education, unemployment, and her current emotional state are significant red flags. The high risk factors (no diploma, no job) probably outweigh the positives, so I'd lean towards predicting NO for rearrest recidivism but with lower confidence because she's in a stable relationship.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which might be considered relatively young and could potentially have a lower recidivism rate compared to older individuals who may face more life challenges.
