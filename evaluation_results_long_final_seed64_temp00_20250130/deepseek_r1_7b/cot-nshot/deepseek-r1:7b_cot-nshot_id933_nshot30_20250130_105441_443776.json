    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That might be a medium risk because even though he's not in trouble legally yet, having an arrest could indicate some issues that might come up later.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 185 lbs. Weight isn't usually a big factor unless it's related to health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone is another medium risk because living with others can provide support and reduce stress, so living alone could be a sign of instability or higher stress levels that might lead to other problems.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can limit opportunities and contribute to substance abuse or other issues.\n\nNot being enrolled in college is also medium risk since education, especially post-secondary, is important for better job prospects and stability.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Job experience can be positive if it shows responsibility, but having just one job might indicate instability or difficulty finding steady employment.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a good sign; substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism.\n\nNot feeling depressed for the past month suggests he's mentally stable, which is positive.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five. A larger household might indicate more support and less stress, but it could also mean living in an environment that doesn't encourage independence or responsibility.\n\nBelieving God has something to do with his personal issues is a medium risk because religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with substance abuse or other behavioral issues if they aren't tied to healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting all these together: Medium risk factors. The lack of education and living alone are significant, but he's stable mentally and doesn't have recent drug use. So I'm leaning towards NO for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without Conviction\", \"medium\", \"Having an arrest without a conviction can indicate potential future issues that may affect reintegration into society or employment, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to increased stress and isolation, which might contribute to behavioral issues over time.\"),\n    (\"No High School Diploma/GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education often correlates with higher rates of substance abuse and other factors that increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Not Enrolled in College\", \"medium\", \"Education, especially post-secondary, is crucial for job stability and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"One Job During the Year\", \"low\", \"Having a job can demonstrate responsibility and employability, which are positive indicators for reintegration and reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No Drug Use in Past Four Years\", \"low\", \"Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism.
