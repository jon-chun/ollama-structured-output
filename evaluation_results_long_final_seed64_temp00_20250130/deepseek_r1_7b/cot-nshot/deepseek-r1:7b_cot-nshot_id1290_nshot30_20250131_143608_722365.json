    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor and assigning a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black female, 22 years old, arrested once but not convicted. Her weight is 158 lbs, which isn't particularly low or high in terms of body type, so maybe that's a neutral factor. She's never married and living alone\u2014this could be a medium risk because living alone can increase feelings of isolation.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is usually associated with lower recidivism rates, so this might actually reduce the risk, which would counteract any other factors that might increase it.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs during the year\u2014employment history is generally positive for recidivism; having stable employment can help reintegrate into society and avoid further issues. So this could be a low to medium factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is good because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates. This would likely lower her risk.\n\nShe feels down during the month but hasn't felt depressed before\u2014this might indicate some temporary stress or anxiety rather than a long-term mental health issue, so maybe low impact on recidivism.\n\nLiving alone at 22 could be concerning because it's a young age for being single and living away from family. This might suggest potential issues with support systems, which could increase risk\u2014so this factor might have a medium weight.\n\nShe lived in a household of size 2 when young\u2014a small household isn't inherently bad, but combined with other factors like isolation, it might contribute to higher risk.\n\nConsidering her age and education level, she's likely to reintegrate well into society. The lack of prior convictions is positive, which usually reduces recidivism chances. However, the factors pointing towards possible isolation or stress could slightly increase the risk.\n\nPutting this all together, while some factors like employment history and education are strong protective factors, others like living alone at a young age might suggest higher risk. I'm leaning towards a low confidence of around 30% that she'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 22, which is relatively young and often associated with lower recidivism rates as individuals are more focused on building their lives rather than engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"She has held 3 jobs during the year, indicating stable employment which can help reintegrate into society positively.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which typically correlates with lower recidivism rates as individuals are more likely to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"She has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator for reduced risk of recidivism due to substance abuse often correlating with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"She feels down during the month but hasn't felt depressed before, suggesting temporary stress rather than long-term mental health issues that could correlate with higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Age 18\", \"medium\", \"She lived in a household of size 2 when young, which might indicate potential isolation or stress contributing to higher risk despite other protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"She is never married and living alone, but this factor's impact may be mitigated by her age and positive employment history.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a small household could contribute to feelings of isolation or stress, which might slightly increase risk despite other protective factors like education and employment history.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
