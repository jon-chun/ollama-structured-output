    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young, but since he's already been convicted once, that might indicate some prior issues. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, so education seems positive, maybe reducing the risk compared to someone without a degree or in trouble with the system again.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which could be a red flag because living with family can provide support and reduce stress. But he's never been married, so that might not directly affect his recidivism rate unless there are other factors related to marital status.\n\nHe has held 2 jobs during the year, which is good because having stable employment can help avoid financial troubles or other issues that might lead to more arrests. However, if those were low-paying or unstable, it could still be a concern, but since he's enrolled in college and has two jobs, I think this is positive.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, can sometimes lead to other issues like accidents or health problems, which might affect his ability to function properly. It's not a direct cause of recidivism, but it could be an indicator of underlying issues that might contribute indirectly.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of mood swings could suggest he's in better mental health, which is generally favorable for reducing recidivism risk. However, if there were prior depressive episodes linked to criminal behavior, this absence might not fully negate those risks.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of 6 in an urban area. Urban living can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates or social issues, which could potentially increase the risk of reoffending. However, having multiple family members might provide more support and stability compared to smaller households.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal circumstances. This religious affiliation might indicate a sense of purpose or moral accountability, which can sometimes be protective against recidivism by encouraging better behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He's got positive factors like education, employment, living with family, and religious involvement. The negative points are his past arrest, drug use, and urban living. The presence of multiple family members in a larger household might mitigate some of the urban risks. His stable job history could also help prevent further issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think he's on the lower risk side for recidivism within three years. However, given his past arrest and other minor negatives, it's not impossible. My confidence is around 40% because while there are some mitigating factors, there are also some contributing ones that could lead to a relapse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"His age of 18 might indicate early onset of issues, but prior convictions suggest he has experienced some challenges which may influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education and College Enrollment\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and enrollment in college are positive indicators that could reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is a potential red flag, but living with both parents in a household of 6 might provide stability which could mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Held two jobs during the year, which can contribute to financial stability and reduce stress, positively impacting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years; while not directly causing arrest, it could indicate underlying issues that might affect recidivism indirectly.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"Hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign for reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Living Environment\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in an urban area; urban living can be associated with higher crime rates but having multiple family members provides support which could reduce this risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Affiliation\", \"high\", \"Considers God to be involved in his life, which might indicate a sense of purpose and moral accountability that could positively influence behavior and recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
