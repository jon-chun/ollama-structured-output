    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I need to determine the relative weights of each risk factor for an 18-year-old female who is mixed race. She has been arrested once but not convicted, weighs 120 lbs, is 5 feet 5 inches tall, living alone without a spouse, enrolled in school, has held two jobs, uses marijuana, feels down sometimes, lived in a household of six at age, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors from the examples provided. Looking through each example, common factors include prior arrests, weight, height, living situation, employment history, drug use, household size, and belief in God.\n\nStarting with prior arrests: She has one arrest but hasn't been convicted. Since she's not convicted, this might be a medium risk factor because even though she was arrested, there's no conviction to indicate full responsibility or potential for severe recidivism.\n\nHer weight is 120 lbs, which is below the typical adult BMI range (BMI around 18.5-24.9). Underweight individuals can sometimes face health issues that might contribute to substance use or other problems, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHeight at 5 feet 5 inches is within the normal range for her age, so no immediate red flags there. She's not tall or short, which doesn't directly correlate with recidivism rates.\n\nLiving alone without a spouse: This might indicate she's single and perhaps less likely to have family support, but it also shows she's independent. However, living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability if there are underlying issues, so this could be low or medium risk depending on other factors.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor as education often leads to better job prospects and reduced likelihood of recidivism. This should probably be a high weight because it shows she's actively working towards improving herself.\n\nEmployment history: She's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience can contribute positively by providing income stability and life skills, so this is likely a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use (marijuana): Past four years of marijuana use could indicate substance abuse issues. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it can lead to legal issues or family problems. This should be a medium to high weight.\n\nFeeling down and not coping well: She mentions feeling down for part of the month, which might suggest she's struggling mentally. Mental health issues are known predictors of recidivism, so this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHousehold size at six at a young age: Larger households can sometimes correlate with higher rates of substance abuse or family dysfunction due to more people sharing resources and responsibilities. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nBelief in God: She considers God as part of her personal life, which might suggest she's seeking support from religion for emotional issues. While this isn't directly tied to recidivism, it can influence behavior positively, so maybe low or medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor contributes differently. Prior arrest is medium, weight is medium, height is low, living alone is low, school enrollment is high, job history is high, marijuana use is medium-high, mental state is high, household size is medium, and belief in God is low. Combining these, the overall risk seems moderate to high because of factors like drug use, mental health, and past issues.\n\nConsidering all this, I'd lean towards a \"YES\" prediction with high confidence since several key risk factors point toward higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has one prior arrest but has not been convicted.
