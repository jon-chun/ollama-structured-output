    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for a specific case based on given risk factors. First, I'll list out all the relevant information from the case.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old female identified as Asian/Pacific Islander. She has one arrest but hasn't been convicted. Her height and weight are 5 feet 0 inches and 115 lbs, respectively. She's never married and living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She's held two jobs during the year. She used marijuana in the past four years and feels down some of the time. At age, she lived with both parents in a household of four. She believes God affects her personal matters.\n\nNow, I'll compare this case to the provided examples (Examples 1-30) to determine each risk factor's weight.\n\n1. **Age**: 21 is within the typical adult range for rearrest recidivism prediction. Not particularly high or low.\n2. **Number of Arrests**: 1 arrest, not convicted. This might indicate some prior issues but doesn't guarantee a future offense.\n3. **Ethnicity**: Asian/Pacific Islander. Generally, this group has lower recidivism rates compared to others, so this could be a mitigating factor.\n4. **Education Level**: High school diploma and attending college. Higher education is associated with lower recidivism.\n5. **Employment**: Employed two jobs. Employment can reduce recidivism by providing stability.\n6. **Drug Use**: Past four years of marijuana use. Drug use, especially recent, can increase risk.\n7. **Mental Health**: Feeling down a lot might indicate underlying issues that could contribute to recidivism.\n8. **Living Situation**: Living alone with no spouse. Living situation alone doesn't directly correlate but can be linked to stressors.\n9. **Household Size at Age**: Lived with both parents in a household of four. Smaller households are generally associated with lower risk, possibly due to more support.\n\nConsidering these factors, the high risk comes from drug use and current mental health issues. The mitigating factors include age, education, employment, and living with family. I'll assign weights based on how significant each factor is in predicting rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old indicates a young adult who may still be developing problem behaviors or life skills affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest but not convicted, suggesting past behavior without conviction does not strongly indicate future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander groups generally have lower rearrest rates compared to other ethnicities, indicating a mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in college are positive factors linked with reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Employed two jobs which can provide stability and reduce stress, but not the strongest mitigator.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana use is a significant risk factor for substance abuse leading to potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Felt down a lot during the past month, which may indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no spouse does not directly correlate with higher risk but can be linked to stressors in some cases.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in a household of four, which is associated with lower risk due to family support but may vary based on circumstances.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
