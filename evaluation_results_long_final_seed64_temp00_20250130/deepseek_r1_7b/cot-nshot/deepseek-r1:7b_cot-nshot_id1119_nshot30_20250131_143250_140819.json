    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old Black male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a lot of arrest history\u20146 times but no convictions. That seems like a strong indicator of past problematic behavior. High number of arrests without any convictions can mean unstable or criminal behavior in the past, which increases the chance of rearrest.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 140 lbs. Weight doesn't directly predict recidivism unless it's related to substance use, but here he's at a healthy weight, so maybe that's not an issue.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or lack of support, which might contribute to negative emotions affecting his behavior.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational barriers can lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism, which he's using here with marijuana and cocaine.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment or being out of touch with education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because there might be underlying issues like lack of skills or motivation.\n\nHe uses drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and feels extremely down every month. Drug use is a clear risk factor for further criminal behavior, including more arrests or other crimes.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of 4. While household size alone isn't a strong indicator, living with multiple people might have had social implications that could contribute to his current issues.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal problems. This could be a sign of spiritual dependence or lack of faith, which can sometimes lead to self-destructive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: His extensive arrest history without convictions is a high risk factor. The drug use and emotional distress are also significant. Even though he's at a healthy weight and living alone, the other factors point towards higher recidivism. So I'd lean towards a \"YES\" outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history (6 times, no convictions)\", \"high\", \"Extensive arrest history without any convictions indicates past problematic behavior and potential for future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Regular drug use can lead to self-destructive behaviors and increases the risk of further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Emotional distress (feeling down every month)\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of low mood or depression can contribute to substance abuse and other behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Education level (no diploma, not in college)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education may lead to substance use as a coping mechanism but doesn't directly correlate with rearrest without additional factors.\"),\n    (\"Living situation (single, never married)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate instability or lack of support which might contribute to negative emotions and behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Employment status (no jobs held during the year)\", \"high\", \"No job experience could mean lack of skills or motivation contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household size at young age (4 people)\", \"low\", \"Household size alone doesn't strongly predict recidivism unless it's associated with other negative factors like living conditions or family issues.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God affecting personal problems\", \"medium\", \"Spiritual dependence can sometimes lead to self-destructive behaviors but without specific evidence, the impact is less clear.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
