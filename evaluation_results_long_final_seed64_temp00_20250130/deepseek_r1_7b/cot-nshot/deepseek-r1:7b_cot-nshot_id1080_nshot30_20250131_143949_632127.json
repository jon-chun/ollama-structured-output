    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two arrests and a conviction. That's definitely a red flag\u2014higher chance of reoffending.\n\nHe's 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 210 lbs. Weight isn't directly a risk factor here unless it relates to health issues, which aren't mentioned, so probably low impact.\n\nNever married living alone. Living situation can affect support systems but not sure how significant that is compared to other factors.\n\nHigh school diploma enrolled in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so this might be a mitigating factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment history is positive for recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use: only marijuana in past four years. Drug use can increase risk if it's recent or severe, but he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might suggest less immediate risk from drug use now.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Larger households sometimes have more resources, so maybe lower risk there.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his life\u2014so spiritual support could be beneficial, reducing recidivism chances.\n\nPutting it all together: two arrests and living alone might increase risk slightly, but education, job history, and spiritual involvement are strong mitigators. So I'd lean towards a low confidence of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests and a conviction can indicate a history of criminal behavior, which may increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently pose a high risk without additional context about support networks or circumstances affecting his stability.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is associated with lower recidivism rates due to better opportunities and support systems.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year can provide financial stability and reduce stress, which are positive factors for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years without recent severe issues suggests less immediate risk of drug-related complications affecting his ability to reintegrate into society.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area may provide a stable environment and resources that could aid in reintegration and reduce stress factors.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Considering God as a part of his life can offer moral guidance, support, and a sense of purpose which are generally protective against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
