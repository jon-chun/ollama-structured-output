    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a moderate number of prior convictions, which usually increases the chance of rearrest. So that's a medium weight because it's not too high but definitely something to consider.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 185 lbs. Weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it's related to health issues, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe low weight for this factor.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014being single can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism because there might not be support or resources available, but it also depends on other factors like prior issues. I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nNo high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a big risk factor; without a diploma, he might have less opportunities and could engage in risky behavior. That's definitely a high weight.\n\nHe's held 5 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can sometimes indicate stability or higher income, which are positive factors. But if he's switching jobs frequently, it might show instability. However, five jobs is quite a lot, so maybe medium weight because it's not clear if it's beneficial or detrimental here.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of recidivism. The fact that he feels down all the time could be related to drug use, which makes this factor high.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area\u2014household size 6. Urban areas can have higher crime rates or stressors, but having multiple family members might provide support. However, a large household doesn't necessarily correlate directly with recidivism unless there are issues within the family. I'll consider this as medium.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal issues\u2014this is more of a personal belief and might not directly impact recidivism unless it affects his motivation or willingness to change. Maybe low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (medium), education (high negative), job history (medium), drug use (high positive), living situation (medium), and personal beliefs (low). The high factors are drugs, prior convictions, and lack of education. These seem to lean towards a higher risk. So the prediction would be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of prior arrests and convictions which can increase the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate significantly increases the risk of recidivism due to potential lack of opportunities and support.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs may indicate some stability, but it could also suggest frequent changes which might not necessarily correlate with rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a strong indicator of substance abuse, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of 6 may provide some support but doesn't directly correlate with higher rearrest rates unless there are underlying issues within the family.\"),\n    (\"Personal Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's involvement in personal issues might not directly impact recidivism risk unless it affects motivation or willingness to change behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
