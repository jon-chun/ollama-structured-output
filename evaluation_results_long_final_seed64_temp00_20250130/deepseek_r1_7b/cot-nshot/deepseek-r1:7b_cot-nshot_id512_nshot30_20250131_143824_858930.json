    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor and assigning a weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 20 years old, arrested once and convicted. That's one risk factor. I remember from the examples that race can be a significant factor in recidivism, often related to systemic issues like lack of access to resources or support networks. So this might have a high weight.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 151 lbs. Weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it's associated with other issues, but here it's just his size. Maybe low weight.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014lack of a support system can increase recidivism because he might not have the same level of community support or help when things go wrong. That sounds like a medium to high weight.\n\nHigh school diploma without college enrollment. Education is usually protective, but maybe in this context, it's considered low risk since he's not getting further education. So perhaps low weight.\n\nHe held 3 jobs during the year. Having stable employment can reduce recidivism because it provides income and stability. That would be a low to medium weight.\n\nNo drug use for four years\u2014that's a good sign, so maybe no risk there\u2014low weight.\n\nFeeling down every month is a problem. Emotional distress or low mood can lead to substance abuse or other issues that might contribute to recidivism. This seems like a high weight factor because it's directly related to mental health and could indicate underlying issues.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in a household of 3 in a rural area\u2014this might mean he doesn't have extended family support, which can be risky. So medium to high weight.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his personal matters\u2014that's actually protective because it suggests he has some level of control and positivity about life, so maybe low weight.\n\nPutting this all together: High for race, medium for living alone, high for feeling down, medium for family situation, and low for education and employment. The job held might offset some of the negative factors but not entirely. The high emotional distress is a strong indicator that he's struggling, which could lead to more issues in the next three years.\n\nSo I think his risk is higher than average, so my prediction would be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals often face systemic barriers that can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone reduces community support and stability, which are protective factors but not always present.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Sustained feelings of low mood can lead to substance abuse or other issues contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of 3 may lack extended family support, which is protective but not always present.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may indicate limited opportunities for further support or positive influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
