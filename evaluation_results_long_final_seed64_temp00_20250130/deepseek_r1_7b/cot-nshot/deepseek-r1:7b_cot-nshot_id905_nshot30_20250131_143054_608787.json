    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by carefully analyzing each factor and assigning a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to them.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 22 years old, arrested twice but not convicted. His weight is between 175-199 lbs, which I think might be a bit on the higher side for someone his age, but not necessarily a red flag unless it's significantly over. He's never married and living alone\u2014this could indicate instability or substance use issues, which are risk factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can sometimes predict recidivism; having a diploma might be seen as positive, but not attending college could suggest other underlying issues like substance abuse or lack of motivation.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year\u2014this is actually a good sign because employment often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Having stable income and job history can help in avoiding further issues.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014it\u2019s a strong negative risk factor. Substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism, so not using drugs could significantly reduce the risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month\u2014mental health stability is another positive indicator. Depression or other mental health issues can sometimes lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. A larger household might suggest more support but could also indicate family dysfunction or lack of supervision if there are issues within the family.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal matters\u2014this is a positive factor as religious involvement can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, possibly due to moral guidance or community support.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: no convictions despite arrests (which might indicate lack of access to the criminal justice system), stable living situation (living alone but not in a problematic way), education and job history suggesting good life choices, no drug use, mental health indicators positive, family background with his mother, and religious involvement.\n\nI think this person has low risk factors. The lack of convictions despite arrests might mean he's not engaging much with the system, which could be a sign of self-control or perhaps not seeking help when needed. His education and job history are positive, and no drug use is a big plus. The family background isn't necessarily a strong risk factor if it's a stable household.\n\nSo putting this all together, I would predict that his 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome is NO with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (2 times but not convicted)\", \"low\", \"The individual has only been arrested twice without a conviction, which might indicate limited engagement with the criminal justice system and possibly self-control or lack of access to it.\"),\n    (\"Employment (3 jobs in past year)\", \"high\", \"Having held 3 jobs suggests stable income and employment history, which are typically associated with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"No drug use (past four years)\", \"low\", \"The absence of drug use is a significant positive indicator as substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental health (no depression in past month)\", \"high\", \"Stability in mental health, particularly without recent signs of depression, is another positive factor that can reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"Family living situation (biological mother, household size 5)\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five suggests some level of family support and stability, though it doesn't inherently indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious involvement (believes God is involved)\", \"high\", \"Believing in a higher power can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates due to moral guidance or community support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
