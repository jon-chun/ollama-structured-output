    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk potential due to impulsivity or less experience in managing risks.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two arrests and one conviction, which suggests some history of criminal behavior. The fact that he's been convicted means there's a formal record, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHis physical description is 6'4\" and 190 lbs. Not sure how much height and weight contribute to risk factors, but they might be relevant in other contexts like physical health or ability to commit certain crimes.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors as there's less accountability and more time for risky activities.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having only a high school diploma might limit job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of economic stress, which can be a risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the year. Stable employment is generally seen as a positive indicator, reducing the risk of criminal activity by providing structure and income.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't necessarily indicative of high risk unless it's accompanied by other factors like criminal history or involvement in the justice system.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is a significant factor; without current depression, it might lower the risk compared to someone with mental health issues that could contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can have various influences, but without more details on family dynamics or socioeconomic status, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor, providing moral support and structure, though its effect can vary widely depending on individual circumstances.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a criminal history, which is a strong indicator of higher risk. His employment seems stable, which might mitigate some risks. His drug use is present but not necessarily indicative of high risk without more context. His mental health seems okay currently, which could lower the risk compared to someone with active mental health issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are elements that suggest a moderate risk, they don't collectively reach the level of 'high risk' as per the initial analysis. There's no indication of severe mental health issues, extensive criminal history beyond two arrests and one conviction, or other high-risk behaviors like gang involvement or significant economic stress.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
