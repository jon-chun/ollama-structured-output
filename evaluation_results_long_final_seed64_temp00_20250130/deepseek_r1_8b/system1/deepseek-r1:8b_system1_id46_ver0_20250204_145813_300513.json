    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to older ones. Being male could also be relevant, though I should consider that gender alone isn't determinative.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own, especially if there's no history of more serious offenses or recidivism.\n\nHis physical description is 5'6\" and 287 lbs. While being overweight can sometimes correlate with health risks, it's not directly related to criminal behavior unless combined with other factors like socioeconomic status or mental health issues.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might be a red flag if there's a history of antisocial behavior or if he lacks support systems, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can increase risk factors like unemployment, which is linked to criminal activity. Not being in college might indicate higher risk compared to someone with further education.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, but having only one job might not be enough to lower risk significantly if other factors are present.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and doesn't feel depressed recently. The lack of recent drug use is positive, and not feeling depressed suggests he's not dealing with that particular risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area with a household of four. Growing up in a larger family, especially in an urban environment, can have various outcomes. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, but without knowing the family dynamics or if there were issues at home, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his personal life. Atheism isn't inherently risky, so that factor might not contribute much to risk assessment.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of arrest, lacks education, possibly some socioeconomic challenges (from living alone and not being employed enough), but no recent drug use or depression. The lack of a conviction and the fact that he's held a job recently might indicate he's turned a corner, reducing immediate risk factors.\n\nI'm leaning towards this person not indicating high risk based on the given factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
