    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male identifying as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. That's a demographic factor that might be associated with higher risk due to potential systemic issues or higher rates in certain communities, but I'm not sure how significant that is on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested 9 times and convicted, which is a strong indicator of criminal history. Nine arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to further issues. The fact that he's been convicted adds to the concern as it shows prior involvement with the justice system.\n\nHis physical description: 5'9\" and 180 lbs. Not particularly indicative of risk on its own, but combined with other factors, it might contribute to higher risk in terms of potential flight risk or physical safety concerns.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone at 19 could be a red flag if there are issues with self-care or supervision, especially if there's a history of substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor as it limits employment opportunities and increases the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities due to fewer positive pathways.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment, especially at 19, is concerning because it can lead to financial stress and higher risk-taking behaviors like drug use or theft.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Recent drug use, even if only marijuana, is a risk factor as substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior and other high-risk activities.\n\nHe has not felt depressed over the past month. While depression can be a contributing factor to criminal behavior, the fact that he hasn't reported feeling depressed recently might mean he's either managing it or that it's not currently affecting his behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 8. Growing up in a large household could have contributed to environmental stressors such as overcrowding, lack of supervision, or exposure to criminal influences, which can increase risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a sense of fatalism or lack of personal control, which might influence his decision-making in ways that could be risky.\n\nPutting it all together: Criminal history is a major factor. Unemployment and lack of education are significant as they contribute to economic stress. Recent drug use adds another layer of risk. The large household background could have contributed to environmental factors that increase risk. His beliefs might affect his behavior in unpredictable ways, possibly leading to higher risk-taking.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being a high-risk case because the combination of criminal history, lack of education and employment, substance abuse, and potentially adverse upbringing all point towards increased likelihood of further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
