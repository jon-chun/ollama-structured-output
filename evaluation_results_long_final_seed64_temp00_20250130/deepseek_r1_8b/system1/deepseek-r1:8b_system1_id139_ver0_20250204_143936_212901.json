    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 20-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but since it didn't result in a conviction, maybe her risk is lower than someone with a history of convictions.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and 134 lbs. Not sure how physical stats play into risk assessment beyond maybe factors like mobility or access to resources, which I don't have info on here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could be a risk factor if it leads to isolation or poor decision-making, but sometimes being alone is stable. Without more context, hard to say.\n\nHigh school diploma, not in college. Having a diploma is positive, as education can reduce criminal involvement. Not being in college might mean she's not part of a protective factor like higher education.\n\nShe has held two jobs this year. Employment is usually a good indicator of lower risk since it provides structure and income, which can deter criminal behavior.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent use within the past month makes it more concerning. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator of higher risk unless combined with other factors like criminal history or social support.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps recently, nothing could cheer her up. This could indicate mental health issues, which are linked to higher risk of criminal behavior if not addressed.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can be a risk factor due to potential exposure to crime and lack of resources.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor if it leads to positive behaviors or social support, but without knowing how she applies her beliefs, it's unclear.\n\nPutting this all together: She has some risk factors like drug use, possible mental health issues, and a disadvantaged upbringing. However, she's employed, hasn't been convicted, and has a high school diploma. These are protective factors that might mitigate the risks.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate to low risk, but I need to assess if it's high or not. Considering her lack of criminal history and some positive factors like employment, maybe the overall risk isn't as high as it could be. But the drug use and mental health issues are concerning.\n\nSo, my confidence is around 60% that she doesn't pose a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
