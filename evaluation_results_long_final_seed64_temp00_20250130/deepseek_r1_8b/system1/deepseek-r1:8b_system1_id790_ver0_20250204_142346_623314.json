    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A prior arrest can sometimes be a red flag, especially if there's a history of similar behavior. But since he wasn't convicted, it's a bit unclear what that means in terms of risk.\n\nHis physical description is 6 feet 0 inches and between 175-199 lbs. That doesn't immediately raise any flags related to risk assessment, unless combined with other factors like substance use or criminal history.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate some independence, but it could also be a sign of social isolation, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not being in college might suggest he's not pursuing further education, which could be a risk factor if it relates to employment or socioeconomic status.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. That's a good sign; stable employment can reduce risk factors associated with unemployment or financial instability.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent drug use can be a significant indicator of higher risk, especially if there's a history of substance-related issues or criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of current depression symptoms is positive, but it doesn't tell us about his mental health history, which could be another factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five in a rural area. Growing up in a large family might provide some social support, which can buffer against risk factors. However, the size and structure of the family could also influence behavior if there were issues within the household.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor or sometimes associated with certain behaviors, depending on how it's expressed.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of arrest without conviction, which is a concern. His recent drug use is another red flag. However, he's employed, hasn't been convicted, and shows some positive indicators like stable housing and education. The lack of current depression symptoms might mitigate some risks related to mental health.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not necessarily high. Without more information on the nature of his arrest or any prior convictions, it's hard to say he's a high risk. His recent drug use is concerning, but if there's no history of severe substance issues or criminal behavior beyond the one arrest, the overall risk might be moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
