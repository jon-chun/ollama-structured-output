    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A prior arrest can sometimes be a red flag, especially if there's a history of behavior that could lead to further issues. But since he wasn't convicted, it's a bit unclear what the nature of the arrest was.\n\nHis physical description is 6 feet 1 inch and 165 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything specific, so I can probably set this aside for now.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone at 18 might be a sign of independence, but it could also mean he's not in a supportive environment, which might increase risk factors like substance abuse or other issues.\n\nHe has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is a positive indicator because it shows some educational attainment. Not being in college might indicate he's not pursuing further education, which could be a risk factor if it's linked to higher crime rates or other negative outcomes.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so this is a positive sign that might reduce the risk of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent drug use, especially within the last month, could be a concern. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate that his substance use isn't tied to mental health issues right now.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can have various outcomes. It might provide more support or it could lead to higher stress if the family dynamics are chaotic. The fact that he considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes suggests he has some spiritual beliefs, which can be a protective factor.\n\nPutting this all together: He's had some risk factors like drug use and an arrest history, but there are also positive indicators such as employment, GED, and current mental health (not depressed). The lack of a recent conviction and the presence of spiritual beliefs might mitigate some risks. However, his age and the fact that he's been arrested once could be concerning if there's a pattern or if this is part of a more serious issue.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if these factors alone indicate high risk without more information about the nature of the arrest or his substance abuse history beyond just marijuana use. It might be a moderate risk rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
