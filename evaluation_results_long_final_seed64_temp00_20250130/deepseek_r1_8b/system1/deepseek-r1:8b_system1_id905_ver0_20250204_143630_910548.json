    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to older ones. Being male and Black could relate to over-policing or systemic issues, but I need more context on how these factors interact with each other.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrest history is important because it shows he's engaged in criminal behavior, even if it hasn't resulted in a conviction yet. This suggests he might have a higher risk of future involvement.\n\nHis physical description: 5'11\" and between 175-199 lbs. Not sure how this directly relates to risk factors beyond maybe physical health or ability to commit certain crimes, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate he doesn't have a support network, which could be a risk factor for things like substance abuse or other high-risk behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence employment opportunities and socioeconomic status, which are sometimes linked to criminal behavior. Not being in college might mean he's more available for criminal activities.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs in the year. Stable employment is usually seen as a positive factor, indicating he's responsible and has structure in his life. This could mitigate some risks.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Lack of recent drug use is a positive sign, suggesting he might be low risk in terms of substance abuse. Not feeling depressed also indicates better mental health, which can reduce risk factors related to mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. Growing up in a large family could provide more support or possibly lead to different stressors, but without knowing the nature of the family dynamics, it's hard to assess the impact on risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a sense of control or purpose, which might influence his behavior in ways that could be either positive or negative, depending on the context.\n\nPutting this all together: He has an arrest history without a conviction, which is concerning. His education level and employment are mixed; he's working but not in college. His living situation is alone, which might increase risk if there's no support network. His recent lack of drug use and mental health seem stable, which reduces some risks.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a bit mixed. The arrest history is a significant red flag, but the other factors like employment, education, and current mental health are positive signs. However, without more information on why he was arrested or the nature of those charges, it's hard to gauge the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards a 'NO' because while there are some concerning factors (arrests), others suggest lower risk. But I'm not entirely sure; maybe the arrest history is enough to tip it towards 'YES'. It's a close call.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
