    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male from Asian/Pacific Islander background. That's a demographic factor that might contribute to higher risk in certain contexts, but on its own, it's not conclusive.\n\nHe has been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can be a sign of higher risk because they indicate criminal behavior, even if it doesn't result in a conviction. However, the lack of convictions means he hasn't been formally charged or found guilty, which might lower the immediate risk compared to someone with a history of convictions.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 145 lbs. Physical build isn't typically a direct indicator of risk, but it can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, though that's not always the case.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone at 18 could be a red flag because it might indicate he doesn't have strong support systems or supervision, which can increase risk factors like substance abuse or further criminal activity.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not being in college might suggest he's not pursuing higher education, which could be a risk factor if it leads to unemployment or other issues that contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial stress and higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activities to support substance use or other needs.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, especially if it's within the past month. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might suggest that his substance use isn't tied to mental health issues right now.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment can expose him to higher levels of crime and stress, which might increase his risk factors. However, living with a father could also provide some level of support or supervision, which might mitigate some risks.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his personal life. A lack of religious beliefs isn't inherently a risk factor, but it can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors if it leads to a sense of moral nihilism or lack of guidance.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests without convictions indicate criminal behavior, recent drug use is concerning, unemployment adds to potential stressors, living alone without support might increase vulnerability, and the urban background could expose him to more negative influences. However, the lack of depression in the past month might mean that his substance use isn't currently linked to mental health issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like there's a moderate risk, but not necessarily a high one. The key points are the arrests, drug use, and unemployment. Without a history of convictions or more severe mental health issues, the confidence in this assessment might be around 60-70%. But since he hasn't been convicted and doesn't show signs of depression, it's not an immediate red flag.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
