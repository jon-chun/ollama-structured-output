    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk potential due to impulsivity or lack of experience in managing risks.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest suggests some involvement with the criminal justice system, which could indicate higher risk compared to someone with no criminal history.\n\nHis physical description is 5'5\" and 130 lbs. Not sure how much this contributes, but being smaller might make situations more challenging or increase vulnerability in certain contexts.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor as it might lead to isolation or poor decision-making without accountability.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor, as it can limit employment opportunities and contribute to higher criminal tendencies.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment can be stabilizing, so having only one job might not be enough, but it's better than none. Still, this could indicate some level of responsibility, which might mitigate risk.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, especially if recent. The types of drugs can influence behavior and potential for criminal activity.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is crucial; without current depression, it's harder to assess, but past issues might still be relevant. However, not feeling depressed recently could mean lower immediate risk factors related to mental health.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household in an urban environment can expose individuals to different stressors and influences that might increase risk.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. This lack of religious affiliation or belief system could mean fewer support networks or moral frameworks, which might contribute to higher risk-taking behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, has a criminal history (arrest), lacks education, has drug use, and lives alone without strong social supports. These factors collectively suggest a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
