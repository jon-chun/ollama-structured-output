    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 19-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a White male, which might be relevant in some contexts but not directly indicative of criminal risk on its own. Next, he has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two arrests and one conviction, which suggests some history of legal trouble, increasing the risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 230 lbs. His weight isn't a direct indicator of risk, but being overweight can sometimes correlate with health issues or other behaviors that might be linked to higher risks.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone could mean he doesn't have the support system that some might have from family or partners, which might increase risk in certain situations.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant factor as it's linked to higher unemployment rates and lower socioeconomic status, both of which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Unstable employment or limited work experience can lead to financial stress, which might increase risk factors like substance abuse or criminal activity.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk for further criminal behavior, as drug use often correlates with involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn the past month, he's felt so down that nothing cheers him up. This indicates possible mental health issues like depression, which can lead to higher risk behaviors, including substance abuse and criminal activity.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four with both biological parents. While family structure can influence behavior, having both parents present might have provided some support, but without knowing if there were issues within the family, it's hard to assess the impact on his current situation.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or the role of religion in his life. Atheism itself isn't a risk factor, but it might indicate he lacks a support system that some find through religious beliefs.\n\nPutting this all together: two arrests and a conviction, recent drug use, mental health issues, limited education and employment, living alone\u2014all these factors significantly increase the risk. The confidence score should be high because each of these points is a strong indicator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
