    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 19-year-old female. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's 19 and identifies as White. That's a demographic factor but doesn't inherently indicate high risk on its own. Next, she has one arrest and one conviction. A single conviction could be a factor depending on the severity and nature of the crime. Since it's not specified, I'll note that as a moderate factor.\n\nHer height is 6 feet 0 inches and weight is 155 lbs. Not particularly indicative of risk. She hasn't been married and is not living alone, which might suggest she's still dependent on family or others, possibly affecting her decision-making or access to resources.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED but is enrolled in a 2-year college. This shows she's seeking education, which could be a positive factor, reducing some risks associated with lack of education.\n\nShe has held one job during the year, indicating she has some work experience and stability, another positive sign.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Past drug use is a concern, especially if it's recent or indicates potential for more serious issues. Feeling down could be a sign of mental health problems, which can increase risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a large household in an urban area. Growing up in a big family might provide support, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or stressors.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior and decision-making, potentially either positively or negatively depending on the context.\n\nPutting it all together: one conviction, recent drug use, possible mental health issues, and some positive factors like education and employment. The combination suggests moderate risk, but without more severe factors like multiple convictions, serious crimes, or significant instability, I don't see a high risk indicated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 1 job during the year.
