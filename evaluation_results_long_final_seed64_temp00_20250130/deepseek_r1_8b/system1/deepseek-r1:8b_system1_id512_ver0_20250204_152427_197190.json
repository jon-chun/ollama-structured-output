    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Being young and part of a minority group can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction suggests some history of legal trouble, which could be a red flag for recidivism.\n\nHis physical description is 5'10\" and 151 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything related to risk assessment.\n\nHe hasn't married yet and lives alone. Living alone might not inherently pose a high risk unless combined with other factors like criminal history or instability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having only a high school diploma can sometimes be a risk factor, especially if there's no further education, which could indicate potential for more issues.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs in the year. Stable employment is usually a positive indicator, so this might reduce some risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but was feeling down \"so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up\" during the past month. This indicates possible mental health issues or emotional instability, which can be a significant risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in a rural area. Growing up in a blended family in a rural setting might contribute to social or economic challenges, increasing risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes influence behavior, but it's not directly indicative of high risk without more context.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a criminal history, which is a strong indicator. His current emotional state suggests possible mental health issues, which could lead to further problems. The lack of education and stable environment might contribute to higher risk factors. However, his stable employment is a positive sign that might mitigate some risks.\n\nConsidering all these points, the combination of criminal history, potential mental health issues, and less-than-ideal living and educational situations suggests a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
