    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but on its own, it might not be too indicative unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a prior conviction can indicate higher risk for recidivism. But I need to consider the nature of the conviction and whether there were subsequent issues.\n\nHis physical description is 5'7\" and 128 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything, so maybe not relevant here.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might be a risk factor as it can sometimes lead to higher risk behaviors or isolation, but again, it's context-dependent.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not being in college could indicate lower socioeconomic status, which might correlate with higher risk factors like substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Regular drug use can be a significant risk factor, especially if there's a history of substance-related issues. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate he's currently stable mentally.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a rural area. Growing up in a stable household is generally protective, but rural areas can sometimes have different social dynamics that might pose risks.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it often correlates with lower criminal activity and better mental health.\n\nPutting this all together: He's got a prior conviction, which is a strong indicator. He's used drugs recently, which adds to the risk. However, he doesn't show signs of depression currently, which might mitigate some factors. His stable upbringing and religiosity could also be protective.\n\nI'm leaning towards YES because the arrest and drug use are significant, but I'm not sure about the confidence level. Maybe around 70-80%?\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
