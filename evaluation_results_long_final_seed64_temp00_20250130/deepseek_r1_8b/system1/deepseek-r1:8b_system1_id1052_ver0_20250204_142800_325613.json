    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk due to impulsivity or less experience with the criminal justice system.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrest history can sometimes indicate higher risk, especially if there's a pattern of non-conviction but continued behavior that could lead to further issues.\n\nHis physical description is 5'9\" and 199 lbs. Not sure how much this contributes, but larger build might be associated with higher risk in some contexts, though it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe hasn't married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the structure or supervision that could deter criminal behavior.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level is a significant factor; lower education can correlate with higher risk of criminal activity.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the year, which suggests he's employed, potentially reducing risk as employment can be a stabilizing factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a known risk factor, especially if it's recent or frequent. However, not feeling depressed might indicate better mental health, which could mitigate some risks.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. Growing up in a large family might have provided some support, but it's also possible that the environment was chaotic, increasing risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor, but if it's tied to a belief that he's invincible or that he won't face consequences, it might increase risk.\n\nPutting this all together: He's young, has an arrest record without a conviction, lacks education, has a history of drug use, and comes from a potentially unstable family background. These factors could indicate higher risk, especially if there's a pattern of behavior that hasn't resulted in serious consequences yet but could escalate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
