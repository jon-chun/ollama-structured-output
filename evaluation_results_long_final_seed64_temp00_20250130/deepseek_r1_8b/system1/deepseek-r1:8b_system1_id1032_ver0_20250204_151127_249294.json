    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 22-year-old female. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but without a conviction, it's not a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nShe identifies as mixed race, which is a demographic factor that could influence her situation in various ways, but I'm not sure how directly related that is to criminal risk.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 124 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything specific here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable family life might be a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of high-risk behavior.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but she's 22, so maybe she's still catching up or has other plans.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, especially if there are limited opportunities or stressors associated with it.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and feels down sometimes. The lack of recent drug use is positive, but feeling down could indicate mental health issues that might need attention.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. Larger families can have different dynamics, but without more context, it's hard to say if this is a risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God or the supernatural. Atheism isn't inherently a risk factor, so that's neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some risk factors like lack of education and unemployment, which could be concerning. However, she hasn't been convicted, has no recent drug use, and has a stable family life. These protective factors might mitigate the risks. Without more information on her mental health or specific criminal history beyond an arrest, it's hard to say if this is a high-risk case.\n\nI think the confidence is around 40% because there are some concerning factors but also strong protective ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
