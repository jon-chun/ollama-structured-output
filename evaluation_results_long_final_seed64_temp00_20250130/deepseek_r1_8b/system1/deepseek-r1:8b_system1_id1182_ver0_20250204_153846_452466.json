    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's a demographic factor that can sometimes be associated with higher risk in certain contexts, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested 7 times and convicted. That's a significant red flag because a history of criminal behavior suggests he might continue engaging in risky activities. The fact that he's been convicted means he's had formal legal consequences, which could indicate a pattern of problematic behavior.\n\nHis physical description is 5'7\" and 142 lbs. Not particularly indicative of risk, but sometimes body type can be associated with certain behaviors, though it's not directly related here.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 21 isn't uncommon, but it could mean he lacks strong social supports or supervision, which might increase risk if he's engaging in high-risk activities.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having only a high school diploma can sometimes be a risk factor, as education is linked to lower recidivism rates. Not being in college might indicate he's not pursuing further opportunities that could divert him from criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held 2 jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but if he's only holding two jobs and perhaps working in low-risk or manual labor roles, it might not provide enough structure to deter criminal activity.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk, as substance abuse is often linked to criminal behavior. The fact that he's been using marijuana within the last year suggests he's still engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression can be a factor in criminal behavior, not feeling depressed recently doesn't necessarily mean he's low-risk. It could mean he's managing his mental health effectively or that his current behavior isn't influenced by depression.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can have various influences. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and larger families might provide less supervision or model behaviors that could contribute to delinquency.\n\nHe considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor, but if he's using it in a way that justifies his behavior rather than preventing it, it might not have the same protective effect.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of arrests and convictions, which is a strong indicator. His recent drug use adds to the risk. Growing up in an urban environment with possible negative influences could also contribute. However, having employment and not feeling depressed recently might mitigate some risks. But given his criminal history and substance abuse, these factors likely outweigh the others.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's probable that he does indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
