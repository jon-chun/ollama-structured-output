    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to older ones. Being male could also be relevant, though I should consider that gender alone isn't determinative.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own, especially if there's no history of more serious offenses or recidivism.\n\nHis physical description is 6 feet 0 inches and 185 lbs. Not sure how physical stats play into risk assessment beyond maybe factors like health or mobility, which aren't detailed here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might be a red flag if it's due to instability, but without more context, it's hard to say. Single status doesn't inherently pose a high risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence factors like employment stability or access to resources, which might affect risk differently.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment is generally seen as a positive factor, indicating some stability, so that's probably a low-risk indicator.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Lack of recent drug use and mental health issues could lower the risk compared to someone with those problems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household might provide some social support or stability, which can be protective factors.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be associated with lower recidivism rates because of moral beliefs acting as a deterrent.\n\nPutting it all together: no prior convictions, recent employment, no drug use, and religious beliefs might indicate lower risk factors. The only arrest without conviction doesn't show a pattern of criminal behavior. Without more serious history or current issues like mental health problems or ongoing substance abuse, the overall risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
