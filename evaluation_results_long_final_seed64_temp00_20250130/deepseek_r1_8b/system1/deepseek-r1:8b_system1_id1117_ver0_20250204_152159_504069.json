    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. That's a red flag because arrests can indicate higher risk of future criminal behavior, especially if there's no prior conviction. \n\nHe's 5'8\" and 161 lbs. Not sure about the weight in terms of risk factors, but height alone isn't a strong indicator.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might be a risk factor as it can lead to more criminal opportunities or isolation issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor for future delinquency or criminal behavior, as it limits employment and life skills.\n\nHe's held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of criminal activity due to lack of structure and resources.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically cocaine. Recent drug use, especially in the past month feeling down, is a strong indicator of higher risk for further criminal behavior or substance-related issues.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of 4. Growing up in a large urban family might expose him to more stressors or negative influences, which can contribute to delinquency.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his life personally. A lack of religious beliefs isn't inherently risky, but it's a factor that could influence his coping mechanisms and social ties.\n\nPutting this all together: arrest history, unemployment, lack of education, drug use, and urban upbringing are all high-risk factors. His age is 21, which is a transitional period where criminal behavior can escalate. The fact that he hasn't been convicted yet but has arrests suggests potential for future convictions or more severe crimes.\n\nI'm pretty confident this person poses a high risk based on these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
