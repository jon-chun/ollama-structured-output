    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 20-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a White male, which might be relevant but not necessarily indicative of higher risk on its own. Then, he's been arrested once and convicted, which suggests some criminal history. That's a significant factor because prior convictions can predict future behavior.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and between 150-174 lbs, which doesn't seem to add much to the risk assessment beyond maybe physical health, but that's not directly relevant here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is not living alone, so he might be in a family situation or with others. That could influence his stability but isn't a direct indicator of higher risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college, which might indicate lower educational attainment, possibly leading to higher risk factors like unemployment or substance abuse.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which is concerning because job instability can contribute to criminal behavior or other risky activities. Unemployment can be a stressor linked to higher risks.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Recent use within the past month of feeling down could indicate current mental health issues or stressors that might lead to further problems, including criminal activity.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Growing up in a larger family might provide some support, but it's also possible that there were challenges if the household was dysfunctional. However, without specific information on the nature of the household, this is hard to assess.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or considers religion irrelevant to his personal life. This could be a protective factor or a risk factor depending on cultural context and how it affects his decision-making, but it's unclear here.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, substance abuse, unemployment, and potential mental health issues (feeling down) are strong indicators of higher risk. The combination of these factors suggests that this person might be at a higher risk for further criminal activity or other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
