    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. That's a demographic factor that can sometimes be associated with higher risk in certain contexts, but it's not conclusive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests alone don't necessarily predict future criminal behavior, especially if there's no history of convictions. However, the fact that he's been arrested multiple times could indicate some involvement in the criminal justice system, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHis physical description is 5'9\" and 165 lbs. Not sure how relevant height and weight are in risk assessment, but they're not strong indicators.\n\nHe hasn't married and is living with someone else. Living situation can sometimes be a factor, but again, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, as it might limit employment opportunities and contribute to socioeconomic issues that could lead to criminal activity.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a stressor and might increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities for survival or due to lack of legitimate opportunities.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a risk factor, especially if it's recent, but the fact that he hasn't been depressed in the past month might mitigate some risks associated with substance abuse.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, can have various impacts on behavior, both positive and negative. It's a complex factor that could either support or hinder criminal activity.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious beliefs isn't inherently a risk factor, but it might affect his coping mechanisms or social supports, which could be relevant.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of arrests, lacks education and employment, uses drugs, and comes from an urban background. These factors could contribute to higher risk, especially if he's been involved with the criminal justice system before and doesn't have positive outlets like work or education. The lack of a support network and possible socioeconomic disadvantages also play into this.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because multiple factors point towards potential issues, even though there's no direct conviction history. The combination of arrest history, educational deficits, unemployment, and substance use suggests higher likelihood.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
