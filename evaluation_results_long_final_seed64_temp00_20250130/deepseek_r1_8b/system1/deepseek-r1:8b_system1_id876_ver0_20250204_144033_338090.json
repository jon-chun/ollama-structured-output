    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Her age is 18, which might be considered a higher risk due to younger age and possible impulsivity. She has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate higher risk of future criminal behavior, especially if there's a pattern or if she hasn't been convicted yet.\n\nHer physical description: 5 feet 2 inches and 115 lbs. Not sure how much that factors in, but maybe being smaller could relate to past behaviors or vulnerabilities.\n\nShe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone might indicate some level of independence, which could be a risk factor if it's due to not having support systems, but it can also mean she's managing on her own.\n\nShe has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Not having further education might be a risk factor as it could limit employment opportunities and contribute to higher risk behaviors like drug use or criminal activity.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a stressor and might increase the likelihood of criminal behavior, especially if she's not engaged in productive activities.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a significant risk factor. The fact that she has used within the last four years suggests ongoing substance abuse, which can lead to criminal activity.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression isn't directly linked to criminal behavior, feeling in control or not experiencing negative emotions might lower inhibitions, increasing the likelihood of risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both biological parents in a household of four. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support, which could be protective. However, if there were issues within the family, it might have contributed to her current behavior.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens personally. This could indicate a sense of control or belief system that might influence her decisions, possibly in ways that are riskier.\n\nPutting this all together: She's young, has arrest history without convictions, uses drugs recently, is unemployed, hasn't completed higher education, and lives alone. These factors suggest she might be at higher risk for further criminal activity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
