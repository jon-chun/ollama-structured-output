    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Her age might be a factor because younger individuals can sometimes have higher risk tendencies due to impulsivity or lack of experience in decision-making. Being White doesn't inherently pose a higher risk, but it's part of her demographic.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions don't necessarily predict future criminal behavior, but they do indicate some involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, it might suggest that she hasn't had a significant criminal history yet.\n\nHer physical description is 5'10\" and 190 lbs. While this doesn't directly relate to risk factors, body type isn't typically a factor in risk assessments unless there's an issue like obesity affecting health or behavior, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she lacks supervision or support, which could increase risks if she's engaging in high-risk behaviors. However, this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor because it may limit job opportunities and contribute to socioeconomic stressors, which can increase criminal behavior. Not being in college might indicate she's not on a productive path.\n\nShe has held 5 jobs in the year. This suggests some stability or responsibility, which could be a protective factor. People with employment often have routines that reduce criminal involvement.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Regular drug use can lead to criminal behavior, financial issues, and other problems. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate she's currently stable or not experiencing the typical triggers for further issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of five in a rural area. Growing up in a large family could provide support or possibly lead to different stressors depending on family dynamics. Without more info on whether the environment was supportive or neglectful, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. This could be a protective factor if she relies on religious or spiritual beliefs to cope with problems, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. Alternatively, it might not directly impact risk.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a history of arrests but no convictions, which isn't a strong indicator. Drug use is a clear risk factor, but her current mental state seems stable. Her employment suggests some responsibility. Education level is a concern, but her job stability might mitigate that. The lack of depression could mean she's managing stress effectively.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are some risks (arrests and drug use), they don't collectively indicate a high risk. She doesn't have a history of convictions, which is a strong indicator of higher risk. Her current situation shows some stability in employment and mental state. Therefore, the overall prediction might lean towards \"NO\" for high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
