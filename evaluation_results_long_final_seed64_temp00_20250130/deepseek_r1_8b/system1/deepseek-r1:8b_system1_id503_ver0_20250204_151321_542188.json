    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall assessment.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk potential due to impulsivity or lack of experience in managing risks. Being White doesn't inherently pose a higher risk, but it's part of their demographic.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could indicate that he hasn't had a chance to show patterns of behavior that might lead to further issues. However, an arrest does suggest some involvement with the criminal justice system, which is a risk factor on its own.\n\nHis physical description: 5'9\" and 230 lbs. While obesity can be associated with higher health risks, it's unclear how this directly ties to criminal risk unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or socioeconomic status.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone at a young age might mean he lacks the structure and supervision that comes with family or a relationship. This could contribute to higher risk behaviors as he may have more freedom to engage in risky activities without oversight.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not having further education can limit job opportunities, which is a known risk factor for criminal behavior due to economic stressors.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment can provide stability, so limited work history might increase risk if he's not developing positive coping mechanisms through work.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Recent substance use, especially marijuana, is a known risk factor for criminal behavior. However, not feeling depressed could indicate that his substance use isn't exacerbating other issues like emotional instability.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults who aren't his biological parents in a rural area. Growing up in a non-traditional household might have exposed him to different influences or environments that could increase risk factors. Rural areas can sometimes have higher rates of certain crimes due to isolation and limited resources.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be both protective and risk-increasing, depending on the context. If it's used to justify actions without taking responsibility, it might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: he's young, has some involvement with the criminal justice system, lives alone, has limited education and employment, uses substances, comes from a non-traditional household, and holds religious beliefs that might influence his behavior. These factors collectively suggest a moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
