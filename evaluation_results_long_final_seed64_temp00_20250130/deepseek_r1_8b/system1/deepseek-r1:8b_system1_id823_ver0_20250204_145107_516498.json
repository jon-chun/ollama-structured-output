    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 20-year-old female and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times and convicted, which is a significant red flag. Arrests and convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\n\nShe identifies as White, but race alone isn't a determining factor here. It's more about her history.\n\nHer height and weight aren't directly related to risk factors, so I can set those aside.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, though it doesn't negate her criminal history.\n\nHaving only a high school diploma isn't the worst indicator on its own, but combined with other factors like arrests, it might contribute to higher risk.\n\nShe held one job last year. Employment is usually positive, but again, her criminal record overshadows this.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years and feeling down in the past month could indicate substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in a large household as a child might have contributed to environmental stressors that could increase risk.\n\nHer belief in God's influence on her personal life could be a protective factor or a source of motivation, but it's hard to predict without more context.\n\nPutting it all together: arrests and convictions are major. Substance use and feeling down are additional concerns. The rest are less impactful compared to her criminal history. So overall, this seems like a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 6. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
