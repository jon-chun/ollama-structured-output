    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 19-year-old female who identifies as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. That's a red flag because arrests can indicate higher risk of future criminal behavior, especially if there's a pattern or if she hasn't been held accountable yet.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 140 lbs. Not sure about the weight as it might vary, but height alone isn't a big indicator here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but since she's young and maybe facing other stressors, it might not negate other risks.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor for future delinquency or criminal behavior because it limits job opportunities and can lead to higher unemployment, which is linked to crime.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment can provide structure and income, but only one job might not be enough to support herself, especially if she's dealing with other issues like substance use.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent use within the past month makes it more concerning because current drug use is often a indicator of higher risk for further criminal activity. Also, considering she's young, this could impact her decision-making and increase the likelihood of poor choices.\n\nShe feels down in the dumps recently, which suggests possible mental health issues like depression. Mental health problems can lead to higher risk of criminal behavior if not addressed.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a rural area as a child. Growing up in a household with three people might have provided some support, but it's unclear if there were other issues. Rural areas sometimes have different social and economic challenges that could contribute to higher crime rates.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can be protective or risk depending on how it's used. If she uses religion to justify actions or feels that her situation is controlled by a higher power, it might influence her behavior in unpredictable ways.\n\nPutting this all together: Arrest history without conviction, current drug use, lack of education, and possible mental health issues are strong indicators of high risk. The fact that she's married might offer some stability, but the other factors outweigh that. Her age is also a consideration as young people can be more impulsive.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
