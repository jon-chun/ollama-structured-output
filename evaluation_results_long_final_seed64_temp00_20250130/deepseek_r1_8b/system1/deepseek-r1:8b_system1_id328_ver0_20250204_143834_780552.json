    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 22-year-old female. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, though it's just an arrest without a conviction. So that's a slight red flag.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and 115 lbs. Not sure about the weight here; maybe it's relevant for health or other factors, but I don't see how it directly ties to criminal risk yet.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors or isolation, which might contribute to criminal activity, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not being in college could mean she's not pursuing further education, which might increase her risk of engaging in risky activities.\n\nShe's held three jobs this year. Stable employment can be a protective factor, as it suggests she has structure and income stability, which can deter criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. That's a positive sign because drug use is often linked to criminal activity. However, her recent mood might affect this.\n\nShe feels \"so down in the dumps\" most of the time in the past month. Depression or low mood can be associated with higher risk behaviors, including criminal ones, as people may act out when feeling hopeless or angry.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area with a household of four. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, might expose her to different influences or stressors that could increase risk.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can sometimes be protective, but it's also possible that this belief could influence her decisions in ways that aren't clear yet.\n\nPutting all these together: she has an arrest history without a conviction, some indication of low mood, and grew up in a potentially stressful environment. However, she's employed, hasn't used drugs recently, and has a religious belief. These factors might mitigate some risks.\n\nI'm not sure if her depression is severe enough to be a significant risk factor. Also, her employment suggests stability. Without more information on the nature of her arrest or her current mental state beyond feeling down, it's hard to assess high risk.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think she doesn't meet the criteria for high risk based on the given factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
