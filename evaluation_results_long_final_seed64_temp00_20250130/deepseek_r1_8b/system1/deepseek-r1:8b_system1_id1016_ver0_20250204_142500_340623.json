    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as Black. That's a demographic factor that might be relevant, but on its own, it's not conclusive. However, in some contexts, being part of a minority group can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, so I'll keep that in mind.\n\nShe has been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions don't necessarily predict future criminal behavior, especially if she's young and maybe just making poor decisions. It's possible she was arrested for minor offenses or situations where she wasn't ultimately charged or convicted.\n\nHer physical description is 5 feet 2 inches and 140 lbs. Not sure how that plays into risk assessment beyond perhaps physical health, but it doesn't immediately stand out as a significant factor.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some independence, but it could also mean she lacks support systems, which might be a risk factor. However, this alone isn't enough to determine high risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor because it's linked to higher unemployment rates, lower earnings, and more involvement in the criminal justice system. This is a strong indicator that could contribute to higher risk.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment can provide structure and stability, which might reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. Having only one job might not be enough to offset the effects of her education status, though.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Not using drugs recently suggests she's addressing substance abuse issues, which is a positive sign. Feeling depressed briefly doesn't indicate long-term mental health issues that might contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size six. Growing up in a large family can sometimes lead to chaotic environments, which might increase the risk of criminal behavior or exposure to crime. This is another factor that could contribute to higher risk.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor if it leads to positive behaviors or social support. However, without knowing more about how she applies this belief practically, it's hard to assess its impact on her behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: lack of education is a strong indicator. She has some risk factors like living in a large household and possibly lacking support systems. However, she hasn't been convicted despite multiple arrests, which might indicate that she's not a high risk. Additionally, her recent sobriety and lack of depression could suggest she's addressing some issues.\n\nI'm leaning towards this being a moderate to high risk because of the education factor, but other factors like no recent convictions and positive behavior changes might mitigate it somewhat. It's tricky because without more information on her criminal history beyond arrests, it's hard to say for sure.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
