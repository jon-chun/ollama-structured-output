    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk due to impulsivity or lack of stable social ties. Being White doesn't inherently pose a higher risk, but other factors might contribute more.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and convictions, which suggests he has a history of criminal behavior. Each arrest could indicate different types of offenses, but the fact that he's been convicted means there's a track record of illegal activity.\n\nHis physical description is 5'10\" and 170 lbs. Not particularly indicative of risk on its own, unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or criminal history.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less oversight or support systems, which could increase risk if he's engaging in high-risk behaviors like drug use or criminal activities.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED is better than no diploma, but not having further education can be a risk factor as it limits job opportunities and may contribute to higher unemployment, which can be linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of criminal activity because without stable income, individuals might turn to illegal means for money.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher risk. Drug abuse can lead to criminal behavior, financial instability, and increased risk of further arrests.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression isn't directly linked to criminality, it's a factor that could influence behavior. However, since he hasn't reported feeling depressed recently, it might not be a primary driver here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults other than biological parents in a rural area. Growing up in a non-traditional household can sometimes lead to higher risk factors, but the impact varies and isn't always negative.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. A lack of religious beliefs doesn't inherently increase risk, though it might affect his coping mechanisms or social support systems.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions, recent drug use, unemployment, and living alone are significant red flags. These factors often correlate with higher recidivism rates and increased likelihood of further criminal activity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
