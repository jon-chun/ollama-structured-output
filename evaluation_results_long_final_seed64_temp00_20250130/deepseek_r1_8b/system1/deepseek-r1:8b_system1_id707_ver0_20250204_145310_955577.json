    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor that might be relevant, but on its own, it's not conclusive. However, considering other factors could influence the overall assessment.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. That's a significant red flag because a history of criminal behavior suggests higher risk. The fact that he's been convicted means he's had formal legal consequences, which can indicate a pattern of problematic behavior.\n\nHis physical description is 6 feet 2 inches and 145 lbs. Not sure how much that contributes, but it's not particularly concerning on its own.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone at 18 could be normal, especially if he's in school or working. It doesn't immediately raise a red flag unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe is enrolled in school currently. School enrollment can be a positive indicator, suggesting he's engaged in productive activities. However, his past behavior might outweigh this.\n\nHe has held no jobs during the year. Unemployment could be a risk factor if it's due to lack of motivation or other issues, but again, it depends on other factors like his criminal history.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a serious concern. It can lead to further legal problems and may indicate higher risk for recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is important, but not feeling depressed recently doesn't necessarily mean he's low-risk overall. His history of drug use could impact his mental health status differently.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of five. Growing up in a large family can have various effects, including different levels of support or stress, which might influence behavior.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religiosity can be protective or sometimes associated with certain behaviors, but it's not clear how this ties in without more context.\n\nPutting it all together: His criminal history is a strong indicator of higher risk. The drug use also adds to that concern. While some factors like school enrollment might suggest he's trying to turn his life around, the combination of past arrests and substance abuse typically points towards a higher likelihood of recidivism or further issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
