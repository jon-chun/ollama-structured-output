    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 22-year-old female. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, though without a conviction, it's not certain if she poses a high risk.\n\nShe identifies as White, which is a demographic factor that can sometimes be associated with higher risk depending on other factors.\n\nHer physical description includes being 5'7\" and 155 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is unless there are specific risks related to her size, but it doesn't stand out here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she has fewer support systems, which could be a risk factor, especially if combined with other issues like substance use.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree and isn't enrolled in college now. Education level can sometimes correlate with lower criminality, but her current situation might affect her stability.\n\nShe has held four jobs in the year, indicating she's employed, which is generally a positive sign for financial stability and lower risk of certain crimes.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent use within the past month makes this more concerning, as it suggests active substance abuse. This is a significant risk factor because drug use can lead to criminal behavior, especially if she's involved in distribution or other related activities.\n\nShe feels down in the dumps recently, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Emotional instability can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors, including criminal activity.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a large household might have provided some support, but being in an urban environment can expose her to more stressors and higher crime rates.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God, which is a personal belief that might affect her coping mechanisms or social supports, potentially increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a history of arrest, current substance abuse, possible mental health issues, and some demographic factors that could contribute to higher risk. However, without a conviction, her criminal history isn't as strong a indicator. Her employment suggests stability, which might mitigate some risks. The combination of drug use and feeling down is concerning, but it's unclear if this rises to a high risk level without more information.\n\nI'm leaning towards YES because the presence of recent drug use and potential mental health issues are significant factors that could indicate higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has completed a Bachelor's degree and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year.

At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
