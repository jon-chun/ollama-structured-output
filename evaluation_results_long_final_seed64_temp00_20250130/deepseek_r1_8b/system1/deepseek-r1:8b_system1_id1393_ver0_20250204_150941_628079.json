    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 20-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but since it didn't result in a conviction, maybe it's less concerning on its own.\n\nShe's 5'10\" and 165 lbs. Not sure how physical stats play into risk assessment beyond maybe health or appearance, which isn't directly related to criminal behavior.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could be a risk factor if it relates to social support or stability, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Having a diploma is positive, but not being in college might indicate lower educational attainment, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, though it's not definitive.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the year. That shows some employment stability, which is generally a good sign.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Recent use within the past month makes it more concerning. Drug use can be a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if there's a history of arrests or other issues.\n\nShe feels down in the dumps recently, nothing cheers her up. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which are linked to higher risk of criminal behavior. Feeling down might also relate to substance abuse.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in a large family in an urban environment can have various impacts, including exposure to different influences and stressors that might increase risk factors.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. That could be a factor if it relates to her coping mechanisms or belief system influencing decisions, but I'm not sure how significant that is on its own.\n\nPutting this all together: She's got a history of drug use, which is a strong indicator. She's feeling down, possibly indicating mental health issues. She's been arrested once, though not convicted. The rest are mixed factors like education and living situation.\n\nI think the key points here are the recent drug use and possible mental health. These can significantly increase risk. Even without a conviction, arrest history shows some involvement that could be indicative of higher risk behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
