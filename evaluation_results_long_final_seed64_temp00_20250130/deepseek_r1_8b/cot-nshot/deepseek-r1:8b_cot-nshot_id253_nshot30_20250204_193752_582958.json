    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 19. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to reoffend, but it's not a sure thing. Maybe medium risk here because they're still in their teens and might have less impulse control.\n\nNext, race/ethnicity: he's Black. Looking at the examples, Black individuals had mixed outcomes, but sometimes higher recidivism rates. I think this is a high risk factor because of the potential systemic issues faced by minorities in the justice system.\n\nArrest history: he's been arrested 5 times without being convicted. This suggests a pattern of behavior that hasn't been adequately addressed. High risk here because repeated arrests often correlate with higher recidivism.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 165 lbs. Not sure how physical stats directly impact recidivism, but maybe taller individuals or those in better physical shape might have more control over their behavior. I'll consider this a low factor since it doesn't directly relate to criminal tendencies.\n\nMarital status: never married and not living alone. Being part of a stable environment can reduce\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c so this is a negative. Maybe medium risk because without stability, there's more likelihood for issues.\n\nEducation: no diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor because education helps people lead law-abiding lives.\n\nEmployment: held no jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c so this is another high risk factor.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana recently. Drug use itself isn't always criminal, but it's associated with higher recidivism rates. Medium risk here because it indicates potential behavioral issues.\n\nDepression: hasn't felt depressed lately. Mental health issues are a risk factor, but if he's not currently experiencing depression, maybe this is low. However, history of depression could be an underlying issue not mentioned here.\n\nHousehold structure: lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5. Larger families might provide more support, so this is a positive. Maybe low risk because family support can deter\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\nReligious beliefs: he doesn't believe in God's influence. Religion can play a role in behavior, but without knowing specifics, it's hard to assess. I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risks are arrest history, education level, and employment status. These factors are consistently linked to recidivism in the examples provided. So, overall, there's a high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher rates of recidivism due to less developed impulse control.\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues that increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests indicate a pattern of behavior likely to reoccur\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Physical stats don't directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of stability can increase\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Low education levels are strongly linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use indicates potential behavioral issues\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Current lack of depression may not indicate underlying issues\"),\n    (\"household_structure\", \"low\", \"Supportive family environments reduce\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious belief can affect behavior outcomes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
