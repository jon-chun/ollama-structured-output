    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll consider this a medium risk because being young can lead to impulsive decisions that result in further arrests.\n\nNext, race is White. Looking at the examples, it seems like White individuals have varying outcomes, but there's no clear pattern indicating higher or lower risk based on race alone. So, I'll assign this as low since race doesn't seem to significantly influence recidivism in these cases.\n\nArrest history: He's been arrested once but not convicted. From the examples, prior arrests without convictions don't always predict future behavior, but having an arrest record can still be a risk factor. I'll rate this medium because it shows some history of problematic behavior.\n\nWeight is 204 lbs. Obesity or being overweight can contribute to health issues and may lead to higher stress levels, which could increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, this is another medium risk factor.\n\nMarital status: He's never been married. From the examples, being single doesn't seem to directly correlate with recidivism, but it might indicate a lack of support systems. However, since there's no clear link here, I'll consider this low.\n\nLiving situation: Currently not living alone. Sharing a household might provide some structure and supervision, which could reduce the risk of further arrests. So, this is a low factor.\n\nEducation: He has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is positive, but not being in college might indicate a lack of further education, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. I'll rate this medium because education levels can influence future decisions.\n\nEmployment: He's held 4 jobs this year. Stable employment is generally a good indicator of lower recidivism as it provides structure and income. So, this is low.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Current or past drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Since he's using drugs recently, this is high.\n\nMental health: He hasn't reported feeling depressed lately. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, but without current symptoms, it's hard to assess. I'll consider this low since there's no indication of current mental health problems.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe in God. Religiosity can be a protective factor against recidivism, so lacking religious beliefs might increase the risk. This is medium.\n\nPutting all these together, the highest risks are drug use and arrest history, both rated high. The other factors like age, education, employment, and living situation are medium or low. So, overall, there's a moderate to high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race does not significantly influence recidivism in the given examples\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Prior arrest indicates potential for future behavior issues\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Obesity can lead to health issues and stress, increasing criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Single status doesn't directly correlate with recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Shared household may provide structure reducing arrest risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of further education can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment provides structure, lowering recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Current or past drug use is a significant recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current symptoms indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religiosity can increase recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
