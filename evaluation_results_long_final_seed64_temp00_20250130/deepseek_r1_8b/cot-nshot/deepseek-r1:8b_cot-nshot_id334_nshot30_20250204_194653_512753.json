    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll consider that a high risk factor.\n\nHe's White. Looking at the examples, race doesn't always directly correlate with recidivism, but it can influence systemic factors like policing and sentencing. It might be medium risk.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. A history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator. He's already been through the criminal justice system, so this seems high risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'4\" and 190 lbs. While physical size can sometimes affect how people are treated in custody, it doesn't directly predict recidivism on its own. Maybe low or medium.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he has fewer supports, which could increase risk. So, that's probably medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence employment opportunities, which in turn affects recidivism. Since he's not in college, maybe medium risk.\n\nHe held three jobs this year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism, so having a job might lower the risk. That would be low or medium.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently. Drug use itself isn't always a predictor, but recent use can increase the likelihood of further criminal activity. So, that's high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed lately. Mental health issues are sometimes linked to recidivism, but not always. Without more info, maybe low or medium.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a young adult. Family structure and environment can impact behavior. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, so that's medium risk.\n\nHe believes God has control over his life. Religiosity can influence behavior, but its effect on recidivism is mixed. Maybe low or medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are age, prior arrests/criminal history, and recent drug use. These seem to heavily influence the likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"young age increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"racial factors can influence systemic issues\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators\"),\n    (\"physical_size\", \"low\", \"physical size alone doesn't predict behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"living alone may reduce support networks\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"not enrolled in college can affect employment\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"current job may stabilize behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"recent drug use increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no recent depression reported\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"urban environment and family structure influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"mixed effects on behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
