    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested twice and convicted. That seems significant because a criminal history often correlates with higher recidivism rates. So, that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe's 22, which is an adult age where people typically have more stable living situations and decision-making abilities compared to teenagers. But being younger might also mean she's still developing better judgment. I'm not sure if her age alone is a big factor here.\n\nHer weight and height are average, but I don't think physical attributes play a huge role in recidivism. It's more about behavior and circumstances.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone now. Living alone might mean she has more independence, which could be either good or bad depending on her situation. On one hand, it gives her the freedom to manage her own life, but on the other hand, without a support system, she might struggle more if things get tough.\n\nShe has a high school diploma, which is positive because education can help reduce recidivism by providing better employment opportunities and life skills. But she's not enrolled in college, so maybe she's relying solely on her current job for stability.\n\nShe held five jobs this year, which shows she has some work ethic and responsibility. Employment can also be a stabilizing factor, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior as she has a routine income.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it often leads to criminal behavior and can create a cycle where getting arrested leads to more drug use. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate she's addressing some underlying issues.\n\nShe lived in a household of size three when she was younger. A larger family might provide more support, but I'm not sure how that directly affects her current behavior or likelihood of reoffending.\n\nLastly, she believes God has something to do with what happens to her. Religiosity can be protective against criminal behavior by promoting values like honesty and respect for the law. It might also help her cope with stress more effectively.\n\nPutting it all together: Criminal history is a strong indicator (high risk). Employment is positive but not as impactful as criminal history. Drug use is concerning, but she's not currently using, which might lower the risk compared to active users. Education is good, but without college enrollment, maybe not as high as if she were in school. Living situation and age are less impactful. Religiosity could be protective.\n\nSo, I think her criminal history is the most significant factor here. She's been convicted twice, which suggests she has a pattern of behavior that leads to arrest. Even though she's holding down jobs and has some positive factors like education and religion, the fact that she's been convicted before increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact weights, but I think criminal history should be weighted high because it's a strong predictor. The other factors might be medium or low in comparison.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
