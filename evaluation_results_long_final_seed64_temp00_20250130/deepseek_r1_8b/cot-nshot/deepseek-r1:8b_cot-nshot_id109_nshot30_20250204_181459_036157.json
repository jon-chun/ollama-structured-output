    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll consider that as a medium risk because while they might be more likely, it's not extremely high yet.\n\nNext, race: he's Black. Looking at the examples, Black individuals had both YES and NO outcomes, but there was a trend where being Black sometimes correlated with higher recidivism. However, without clear data, I'll assign this as medium.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested once and convicted. From the examples, having an arrest or conviction seems to increase the likelihood of recidivism. So, this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'8\" and between 150-174 lbs. I don't see a direct correlation in the examples, so maybe low or medium. Since he's married and living with his spouse, that might indicate some stability, which could lower the risk. So, I'll go with medium here.\n\nMarital status: He's married and living with his spouse. From the examples, being married sometimes reduced recidivism chances. This seems like a positive factor, so low risk.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. From the examples, lacking education was a significant factor for recidivism. So, this is definitely high risk.\n\nEmployment: Held 2 jobs this year. Having steady employment can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior, so this is low to medium risk.\n\nDrug use: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Not using drugs lowers recidivism chances, so low risk.\n\nMental health: He felt down sometimes last month. Some examples showed that mental health issues could increase recidivism, but it's not clear here. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: Lived in a household of 8. Larger households might provide more support, reducing recidivism, so low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God has something to do with his life. Religion can be a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risks are arrest history and lack of education, both high. The others are medium or lower. So overall, I think there's a moderate chance he'll be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals sometimes had higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Having an arrest and conviction increases likelihood\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"medium\", \"Stable weight and height don't directly correlate\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Married with spouse indicates stability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong recidivism factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held 2 jobs indicating stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Some concern about mental health\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Large household may provide support\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
