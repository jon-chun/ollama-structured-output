    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll consider this a medium risk because being young can lead to impulsive decisions that result in further arrests.\n\nNext, race/ethnicity: he's White. Looking at the examples, it seems that White individuals might not have as high a recidivism rate compared to others, but I'm not sure if there's a clear trend here. Maybe this is a low risk factor since there wasn't a strong correlation in the data provided.\n\nArrest history: he's been arrested twice and convicted once. From the examples, having multiple arrests increases the likelihood of recidivism. So, this should be a high risk factor because prior convictions indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to further issues.\n\nCurrent occupation: He has held 1 job and is not enrolled in college. Having stable employment might reduce the chances of getting into trouble, but since he's only had one job and isn't in education, maybe this is medium risk. It's better than being unemployed, but not great either.\n\nMarital status: Never married. From the examples, being single doesn't seem to directly correlate with recidivism, so I'll consider this a low factor because marital status alone doesn't predict much.\n\nLiving situation: He's living alone now. In the past, living with family might have been protective, but since he's on his own, it could be either medium or high. On one hand, independence might lead to more responsibility, but on the other, without supervision, bad decisions can occur. I'll go with medium.\n\nEducation: He has a GED and isn't in college. A GED is better than nothing, but not having further education might increase his chances of getting into trouble. So, this could be medium risk because education can be a protective factor.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Current drug use is a significant factor. From the examples, active drug use seems to contribute to recidivism, so this should be high risk.\n\nMental health: He hasn't mentioned any issues, but some people who have problems with substance abuse might also have mental health issues. Since he's using drugs, it's possible, but without specific info, I'll consider this a low factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe in God. In the examples, religious beliefs sometimes play a role, but without more data, I can't say for sure. Maybe this is low risk because lack of belief might not directly correlate with recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risks are arrest history and current drug use, both high factors. The others are medium or low. So, overall, the prediction leans towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"race/ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals may not show a strong correlation with recidivism based on the examples provided\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to further issues\"),\n    (\"current_occupation\", \"medium\", \"Having stable employment might reduce but not eliminate the likelihood of trouble\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marital status alone does not strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase the likelihood of bad decisions without supervision\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of further education can be a risk factor for getting into trouble\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Current drug use significantly increases the chances of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No specific mention of mental health issues, but substance abuse often co-occurs with them\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious beliefs may not directly correlate with recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
