    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to reoffend, but it's not a sure thing. Maybe medium risk here because they're still in a higher risk demographic but not the highest.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. In the examples, some Hispanics had outcomes both ways, so I think this is a medium factor since it doesn't consistently predict recidivism either way.\n\nArrest history: He's been arrested once but not convicted. Examples show that prior arrests, especially without a conviction, might be a medium risk because it indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system, which can increase future chances.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 199 lbs. Being heavier could sometimes be protective, but in this case, it's more about muscle mass or perceived threat. Maybe low risk here since he doesn't present an immediate physical threat.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. From examples, being single can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism due to lack of support systems. So maybe medium risk because living alone might mean less supervision but also more opportunity for bad decisions.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a strong predictor; without it, recidivism rates are higher. This seems like a high risk factor because education is linked to better life outcomes and lower criminal behavior.\n\nEmployment: Held 3 jobs this year. Stable employment can be protective. Examples showed that having a job reduces recidivism chances. So maybe low risk here since he's working, which suggests some responsibility.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Current drug use is a significant factor. From examples, current substance abuse increases recidivism risk. This should be high risk because ongoing drug use can lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nDepression: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues are often linked to recidivism, but without current symptoms, it's unclear. Maybe low risk here since he's not currently experiencing depression.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: Lived with his biological mother in a household of 5. Larger households might provide more support or supervision, which could be protective. So maybe medium risk because growing up in a family might offer some stability.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God involved in his life. Religion can be protective, providing moral support and structure. This seems like a low to medium factor since it depends on how strongly he practices and whether it influences his behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risk factors are education (high) and drug use (high). The others are medium or lower. So overall, I think there's a moderate chance of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates, but not the highest.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic ethnicity showed mixed outcomes in examples\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Prior arrest without conviction is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Heavier build may not significantly affect recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone can increase risk due to lack of support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education strongly correlates with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Current drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No current depression symptoms may lower risk\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Larger household at youth may offer some stability\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective but effect varies\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
