    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Age is a big factor because younger people typically have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals who might have more stability in their lives. So I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction doesn't necessarily predict future behavior, but it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. This could be a low or medium factor depending on how it's weighted compared to other factors.\n\nHer height and weight are within a normal range (5'5\" and between 125-149 lbs). Physical health isn't directly linked to recidivism, so I don't think this is a significant factor here.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is currently not living alone. Living situation can impact behavior; having a stable living environment might reduce the risk of criminal activity. So this could be a low or medium factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence employment opportunities, which in turn affects earnings and overall stability. A high school diploma is positive, so maybe this is a low factor since she's not undereducated.\n\nShe held one job last year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, both of which are protective against criminal behavior. So having some work experience might lower the recidivism risk, making this a low factor.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it often co-occurs with other criminal behaviors. This seems like a high factor since substance abuse can lead to further criminal activity.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate she's managing her mental health well. Mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism rates, so if she's not currently experiencing depression, this could be a low factor.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 4. Growing up in non-traditional households might have contributed to her current situation. This is a medium risk because inconsistent care can lead to behavioral issues.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Religiosity can be a protective factor against criminal behavior, so lacking religious beliefs might increase the risk, making this a high factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant factors are her recent drug use and her upbringing in a non-traditional household. These seem to have the highest impact on recidivism. The arrest history is moderate, but without a conviction, it's less concerning. Employment and education are positive, but they might not outweigh the negative influences of substance abuse and unstable upbringing.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think she has a medium risk of being rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"Arrest without conviction is less concerning than with\"),\n    (\"physical_health\", \"low\", \"Physical health not directly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Stable living environment may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma indicates some stability\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Employment provides financial and structural stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant recidivism factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Currently not depressed may indicate good mental health management\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Non-traditional household can contribute to behavioral issues\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"high\", \"Lack of belief may increase recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
