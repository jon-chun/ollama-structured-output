    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 19. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to be rearrested, especially if they have prior convictions. So, I'll give this a high weight.\n\nNext, race: American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. Looking at the examples, it seems that racial factors might influence recidivism rates, but without specific data on this group, it's hard to say. Maybe medium weight.\n\nArrest history: 9 arrests and convicted. That's a lot, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nWeight: 180 lbs. From the examples, being heavier doesn't seem directly linked to recidivism, so maybe low or medium. I'll go with medium since it might affect physical health or mobility, which could be a factor.\n\nMarital status: Never married. In some cases, marriage can be protective, but without that data here, it's unclear. Maybe medium weight.\n\nLiving alone: Yes. Living alone might increase risk due to lack of support, so high weight.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this should be high.\n\nEmployment: Held no jobs this year. Unemployment is linked to higher recidivism rates, so high weight.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Current substance use can increase the likelihood of further arrests, so medium weight.\n\nDepression: Not felt depressed recently. Depression can contribute to criminal behavior, but since it's not currently an issue, maybe low or medium. I'll go with medium because past issues might still influence behavior.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: 8 people. Larger families might provide more support, reducing risk, so low weight.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes in God's influence. Religion can be protective, but it varies. Maybe medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest weights are on arrest history, education, unemployment, and living alone. These factors strongly predict recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Racial factors may influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Physical health can affect behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Marriage can be protective\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Lack of support may increase risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Education is crucial for reducing recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment links to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Substance use increases arrest likelihood\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Depression can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Larger families may offer support\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
