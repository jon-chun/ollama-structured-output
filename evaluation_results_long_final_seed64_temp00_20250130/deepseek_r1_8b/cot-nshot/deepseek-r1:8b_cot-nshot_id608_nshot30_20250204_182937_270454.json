    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has been arrested three times and convicted. That seems like a strong indicator that she might reoffend or be rearrested again. So, I think that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe is 22 years old, which is an adult age where people are more likely to have stable housing and jobs, but in this case, she's living alone without a high school diploma or GED. That lack of education could make it harder for her to find steady employment or improve her situation, increasing the chances of getting into trouble again.\n\nShe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently, which is another red flag. Drug use often correlates with criminal behavior, so this is a significant risk factor.\n\nShe's living alone without family support, which might mean she doesn't have a strong network to help her stay out of trouble. That could contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe has held three jobs in the past year, which shows some work ethic, but since she lacks formal education, it might be challenging for her to maintain stable employment long-term.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a bit confusing because mental health issues can sometimes lead to criminal behavior. Maybe this factor isn't as relevant here.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her. That could mean she has some spiritual support or believes in a higher power, which might help her stay on the right path, but it's unclear how significant this is compared to other factors.\n\nPutting all these together, her criminal history and drug use are major issues. Her lack of education and unstable living situation also play roles. While having a job shows some responsibility, without further education or support, she might struggle in the future. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed recently might mean she's not dealing with mental health issues now, but past problems could still affect her.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the highest risk is from her criminal history and drug use. Those are strong indicators of potential rearrest. Her lack of education and unstable living situation also contribute, so those should be medium risks. The job she held might show some responsibility, so that's a low factor. The spiritual belief and not feeling depressed are less impactful here.\n\nSo, I'd assign high risk to her criminal history and drug use, medium to her education and living situation, and low to her employment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested three times and convicted, which significantly increases the likelihood of future rearrest\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED makes it harder to find stable employment and improve situation\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without family support can contribute to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held three jobs in the past year, showing some work ethic despite lack of education\"),\n    (\"spiritual_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence may provide some support but is less impactful than other factors\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No indication of current depression, which might not be as relevant without more information\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
