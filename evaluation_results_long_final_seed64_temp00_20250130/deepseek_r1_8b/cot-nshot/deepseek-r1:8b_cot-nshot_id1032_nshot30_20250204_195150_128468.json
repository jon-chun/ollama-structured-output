    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as mixed race. Age is a big factor; younger people typically have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals. So I think that's a medium risk because being young increases the chance of reoffending.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. That suggests she might have had some involvement with the criminal justice system, which could mean she's more likely to reoffend if not properly addressed. This seems like a medium factor as well.\n\nHer height is 5'6\" and weight is 124 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stature directly affects recidivism, but maybe being smaller or average size doesn't have a significant impact. Maybe this is a low risk factor since it's less clear how it contributes.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse. Having a stable family life can be a protective factor against criminal behavior. This seems like a strong positive indicator, so I'll consider this as a high protective factor, which might lower the recidivism risk. But since we're focusing on factors that increase risk, maybe this isn't directly applicable here.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits employment opportunities and can lead to higher unemployment, which is linked to criminal behavior. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nShe has held no jobs this year. Unemployment is another significant risk factor as it often correlates with higher crime rates due to limited legal avenues for income. So this is also a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but some of the time she's felt down. This mixed signal is tricky. On one hand, not using drugs recently might indicate lower involvement in the criminal justice system, but feeling down could mean she's at risk for other issues like mental health problems or emotional instability, which can contribute to recidivism. I think this is a medium factor because while drug use isn't an issue now, her mood could still pose risks.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. A larger family might provide more support, but without knowing the specifics, it's hard to say. Maybe having a stable family can be protective, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personal matters. Religiosity can be a protective factor against criminal behavior as it provides moral guidance and social support. If she lacks religious beliefs, that might increase her risk, making this a medium factor.\n\nPutting all these together: age (medium), prior arrest (medium), education (high), employment (high), mood (medium), family size (low), and religiosity (medium). The highest risks are education and employment, both high factors. These contribute significantly to recidivism, so I think the overall risk is medium to high.\n\nBut wait, she's married and hasn't used drugs recently, which might mitigate some of these risks. However, her lack of education and unemployment are strong predictors. So maybe it's a medium-high risk.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if the factors should be weighted differently, but based on the examples provided, education and employment seem to have the highest impact. So I'll assign high weights to those.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Arrest history is a strong predictor of future recidivism\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education increases the risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is linked to higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"mood\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down can contribute to behavioral issues\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"low\", \"A larger family may provide more support, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious beliefs can increase recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
