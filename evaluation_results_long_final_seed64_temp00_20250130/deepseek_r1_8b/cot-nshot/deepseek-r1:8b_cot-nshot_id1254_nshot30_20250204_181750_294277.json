    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. From the examples given, it seems that age plays a role, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors like criminal history or substance abuse.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That might indicate he's at risk of further arrests because he's already had contact with the legal system without completing his sentence. This could mean he's more likely to reoffend due to a lack of accountability.\n\nHis physical build is 5 feet 9 inches and 185 lbs, which I'm not sure how relevant that is. Maybe it affects his ability to avoid detection or participate in criminal activities, but I don't have enough information to assess this accurately.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone now. Living alone might mean he has fewer supports in place, which could increase his risk of engaging in criminal behavior. However, without knowing more about his support network, it's hard to say how significant this factor is.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong indicator for future delinquency because it limits job opportunities and increases the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year, which further supports the idea that he lacks structure and support, making him more vulnerable to recidivism. Without employment, he might resort to illegal activities for income or status.\n\nHe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years and feels down sometimes. Substance abuse is a major risk factor because it impairs judgment and increases the likelihood of criminal behavior. The fact that he's using multiple substances and feels depressed could exacerbate his risk.\n\nHe lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 3. Growing up in a non-traditional household might have contributed to his current situation. However, without knowing the nature of those relationships, it's hard to determine the exact impact on his behavior.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This lack of belief or connection to higher values might mean he lacks internal moral constraints, increasing his risk of reoffending.\n\nPutting all this together, the most significant factors seem to be his lack of education, substance abuse, and criminal history. These are all high-risk indicators based on the examples provided. His employment status and living situation also contribute but perhaps to a lesser extent.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion_or_beliefs\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
