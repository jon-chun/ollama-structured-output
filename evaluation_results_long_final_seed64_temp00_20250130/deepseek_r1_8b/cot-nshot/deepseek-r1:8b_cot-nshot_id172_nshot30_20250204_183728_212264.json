    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old Hispanic female. Age is a big factor; younger people are generally more likely to reoffend because they might have less experience with the consequences of their actions and more exposure to criminal influences.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests she might have some history of problematic behavior, which could increase her risk compared to someone with no prior arrests.\n\nHer weight is 174 lbs., which is on the higher side. I'm not sure how this directly ties in, but being overweight can sometimes be a factor in physical health issues that might contribute to criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone without a support system can increase vulnerability to negative influences and make it harder to avoid criminal activities.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor because it limits job opportunities and increases the chances of involvement in criminal activities.\n\nShe held only one job last year. Employment can provide structure and reduce crime, so having limited work history might be a concern.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a red flag, but frequent use can lead to addiction or other issues that might contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe felt down sometimes over the past month, indicating possible mental health issues. Depression or anxiety can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with adults who weren't her biological parents. This could mean she lacked stable care, which is a known risk factor for delinquency.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God's influence on her life. Religiosity can play a role in reducing crime by providing moral support and structure, so this might increase her risk.\n\nPutting all these together, several factors stand out as high risks: age, prior arrest, lack of education, living alone, drug use, mental health issues, and unstable upbringing. These are all significant indicators that she might be rearrested again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have less experience and more exposure to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A history of arrest can indicate higher likelihood of future criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight may influence physical health but not directly criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Lack of support increases vulnerability to negative influences\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No diploma limits job opportunities and increases crime risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Limited work history reduces structure and stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance use can lead to addiction and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Mental issues like depression can impair judgment and increase crime\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"high\", \"Stable family background is crucial for reducing delinquency\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief may reduce moral support against crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
