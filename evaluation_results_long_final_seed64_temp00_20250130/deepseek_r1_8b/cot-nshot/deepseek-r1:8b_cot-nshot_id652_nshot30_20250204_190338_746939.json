    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have a higher risk of recidivism. For example, in Example 26, an 18-year-old had a \"YES\" outcome. So I'll assign this a high weight because being young and likely to engage in risky behavior increases the chance of reoffending.\n\nNext, Hispanic ethnicity. Looking at the examples, there's no direct correlation mentioned for ethnicity, but since this person identifies as Hispanic, it might be a medium risk factor. However, without specific data on how ethnicity affects recidivism, I'm not sure if it should be high or low. Maybe medium is safer.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested once but not convicted. Examples show that prior arrests are significant. For instance, in Example 26, an arrest led to a \"YES\" outcome. So this is probably a high risk factor because a history of arrest suggests potential for future criminal behavior.\n\nWeight between 150-174 lbs. In the examples, weight wasn't directly addressed, but being within that range might not be as significant as other factors like age or prior arrests. Maybe low or medium. I think it's less impactful, so perhaps low.\n\nNever been married and living alone. From the examples, living alone didn't seem to affect recidivism much. For example, in Example 27, he wasn't living alone but still had a \"NO\" outcome. So maybe this is a low risk factor because living alone doesn't inherently increase or decrease the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHigh school diploma: He has one, which is positive. Examples show that education can be protective. For instance, in Example 26, having a diploma might have contributed to a \"NO\" outcome. So this is probably a low risk factor because education reduces recidivism risks.\n\nNot enrolled in college: This could be a concern as higher education is linked to lower recidivism rates. However, since he has a high school diploma, maybe the impact here isn't as strong. Still, not being in further education might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHeld 2 jobs: Stable employment can reduce recidivism. Examples show that having a job often leads to \"NO\" outcomes. So this is likely a low or medium risk factor. Since he's holding two jobs, it's a positive indicator, so maybe low.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years and felt down at times. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a known risk factor for recidivism. In Example 26, drug use led to a \"YES\" outcome. So this is definitely a high risk factor because substance abuse increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nFelt down sometimes: Depression or feeling down can lead to criminal behavior as people might cope with negative emotions through substance abuse or other harmful ways. This could be a medium risk factor because mental health issues contribute to recidivism, but it's not as direct as substance use.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of size 5: A stable family environment can reduce recidivism. In Example 26, living with both parents led to a \"NO\" outcome. So this is probably a low or medium risk factor. Since he had a supportive family, it's a protective factor.\n\nConsiders God nothing: Religiosity can be a protective factor. If someone lacks religious beliefs, they might have fewer inhibitions, increasing recidivism risk. This could be a medium risk factor because without religion, there's less internal accountability.\n\nPutting this all together, the most significant factors are age (high), prior arrest (high), substance use (high), and possibly mental health (medium). The other factors like education, employment, family support, and religious beliefs might mitigate some of these risks but aren't as impactful.\n\nSo, considering all these weighted factors, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"young age increases risk of engaging in criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic ethnicity may contribute to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"prior arrest suggests potential for future criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"within 150-174 lbs, not directly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"not married and living alone doesn't inherently increase risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"high school diploma is protective\"),\n    (\"college_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"not enrolled may pose some risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"holding 2 jobs is positive\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"marijuana use is a known risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"feeling down can lead to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"low\", \"supportive family environment is protective\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"lack of belief may increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\"\n}\n```",
