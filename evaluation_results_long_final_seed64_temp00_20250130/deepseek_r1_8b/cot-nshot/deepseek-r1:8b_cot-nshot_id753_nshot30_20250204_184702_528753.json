    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 19. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll give this a high weight.\n\nNext, race: he's White. Looking at the examples, White individuals had mixed outcomes but didn't show a clear pattern that stands out compared to others. Maybe medium weight here.\n\nArrest history: He's been arrested twice and convicted once. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of higher risk. High weight for this factor.\n\nWeight: 230 lbs. Being overweight can contribute to health issues, which might lead to more criminal behavior or poor decision-making. Medium weight seems appropriate.\n\nMarital status: Never married. From the examples, being single didn't seem to correlate strongly with recidivism, so maybe low weight here.\n\nLiving situation: Lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor as there's less supervision and accountability. Medium weight makes sense.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED. Lack of education is a significant risk factor for recidivism. High weight here.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job. Having some employment history might reduce the risk compared to unemployed individuals, so medium weight.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Current or recent drug use is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk. High weight for this factor.\n\nMental health: He feels down all the time. Depression can lead to criminal behavior, so high weight here as well.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in a household of size 4. Stable family environments might reduce risk, but since he's using drugs and feeling down, maybe medium weight.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his life. Lack of religious belief isn't directly tied to recidivism, so low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest weights are on arrest history, drug use, mental health, education, and age. These factors strongly suggest a high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
