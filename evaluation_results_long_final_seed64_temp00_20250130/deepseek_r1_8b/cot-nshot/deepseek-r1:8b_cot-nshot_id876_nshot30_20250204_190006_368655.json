    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. That suggests she might have some criminal history, which could increase her risk. But since she hasn't been convicted before, maybe she's less likely to reoffend compared to someone with a conviction. I'll give this a medium weight because it shows some involvement with the legal system.\n\nNext, she's 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 115 lbs. Not sure how physical stature directly affects recidivism, but being underweight might indicate stress or other factors that could contribute to criminal behavior. Maybe this is a low factor since it's less clear.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor as it might lead to more opportunities for bad decisions without accountability. This seems like a medium weight because living alone can influence behavior.\n\nShe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is positive, indicating some education, which could reduce her risk compared to someone without it. But not being in college might mean she's less motivated or lacks structured activities, so this is a bit of a medium factor.\n\nShe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a stressor and might increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. This seems like a high-weight factor because joblessness is a known risk for recidivism.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator, but active use can definitely contribute to criminal behavior. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean she's addressing some issues. Still, recent drug use is concerning, so this is a high-weight factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which could indicate she's managing her mental health or that she's not currently dealing with that issue. This seems like a low weight because it suggests she's in a better mental state.\n\nLastly, at a young age (18), she lived with both parents in a household of size 4. Growing up in a stable home might have provided her with better support, which could reduce her risk compared to someone without such support. This is a medium-weight factor because family support can be protective.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest weight factors are joblessness and drug use, both high. The others are medium or low. So, I think she has a higher likelihood of being rearrested, but not certain. Maybe around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested twice, indicating some involvement with the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"Physical Build\", \"low\", \"Her physical stature may indicate stress or other factors but is less directly related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes increase risk due to lack of accountability\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not being in college might indicate lower motivation\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can be a significant stressor and risk factor\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use increases the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests she may be managing mental health issues\"),\n    (\"Age and Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a stable household can provide support, reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
