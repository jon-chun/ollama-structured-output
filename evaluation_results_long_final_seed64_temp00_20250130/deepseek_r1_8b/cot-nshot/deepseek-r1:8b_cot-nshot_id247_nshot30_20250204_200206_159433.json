    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. From the examples provided, younger individuals seem more likely to have higher recidivism rates. So, I'll give this a high weight.\n\nNext, race: he's White. Looking at the examples, White individuals had mixed outcomes, but it didn't seem as strong a predictor as other factors. Maybe medium weight.\n\nArrest history: He's been arrested twice and convicted once. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk. High weight here.\n\nWeight: 275 lbs. Being overweight can sometimes correlate with higher criminal activity, though the examples don't directly tie it to recidivism. I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nMarital status: He's married and living with his spouse. Marriage is often associated with lower crime rates, so this should reduce the risk. High weight for this factor.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having education can sometimes prevent recidivism, but without further education, it might not be as protective. Medium weight.\n\nEmployment: He's held two jobs this year. Employment is a strong positive factor that reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior. High weight here.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Current or recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. High weight.\n\nDepression: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, so not being affected might lower the risk. Medium weight.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents as a child in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment is protective against crime. High weight.\n\nReligious beliefs: He considers God has something to do with his life. Religious beliefs can be protective and reduce recidivism risk. High weight.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors with high weights are age, arrest history, employment, drug use, family background, and religious beliefs. These seem to heavily influence the likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals had mixed outcomes in examples\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions are strong predictors\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Overweight may correlate with higher criminal activity\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Marriage reduces crime rates\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without further education is less protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Employment is strongly linked to lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Stable family environment is protective\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Religious beliefs can reduce recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
