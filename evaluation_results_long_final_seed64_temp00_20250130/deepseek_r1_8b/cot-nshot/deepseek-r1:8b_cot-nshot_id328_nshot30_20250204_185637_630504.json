    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the likelihood of this person being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has a history of arrest but hasn't been convicted. That might mean she's more likely to reoffend because she hasn't been held accountable before. But I'm not sure if that's a strong indicator on its own.\n\nNext, her current mental state is a concern. She feels mostly down and hopeless, which could be a sign of higher risk for further issues. People who are struggling mentally might have a harder time staying out of trouble.\n\nShe's living alone now, which could mean she doesn't have the support system that might help her avoid getting into more legal trouble. On the other hand, having her own place might give her more freedom, which could also be risky if she's dealing with negative emotions.\n\nHer employment situation is positive\u2014she has a steady job and has held three positions. That's a good sign because work can provide structure and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. But I wonder how stable that job is or if there are any underlying issues affecting her mental health that could impact her work performance.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is positive. Drug use often correlates with higher recidivism rates, so this might lower her risk compared to others.\n\nHer family background includes living with her biological mother in a household of size four. That's a moderate-sized family, but I don't know if that's supportive or not. If the family environment was unstable, it could contribute to her current issues, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe considers God as something that affects her life. This might mean she has a strong sense of purpose or moral framework, which could help her avoid criminal behavior. Alternatively, it might be a coping mechanism that's not effective enough.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the most significant factors are her recent arrest history and her current mental health struggles. These seem to have the highest weight because they directly relate to recidivism\u2014past behavior is often indicative of future behavior. Her employment and lack of drug use are positive signs but might not outweigh the negative factors.\n\nSo, assigning weights: arrest history and mental health would be high risk factors. Living alone and job stability could be medium. Family background and her religious beliefs might be low since there's less direct correlation with recidivism.\n\nBased on these weights, I'm leaning towards a higher likelihood of rearrest, but not certain. Maybe around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
