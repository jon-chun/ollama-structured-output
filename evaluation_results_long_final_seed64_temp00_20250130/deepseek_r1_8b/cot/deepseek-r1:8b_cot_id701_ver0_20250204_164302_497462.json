    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. From what I know, younger people, especially those in their late teens and early twenties, are more likely to reoffend because they might have less experience with the consequences of their actions or better access to opportunities for criminal behavior. So that's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race is a significant factor here, but some studies suggest that racial disparities can influence arrest and conviction rates, which in turn affect recidivism. Since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe this isn't the highest priority factor.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. A history of arrest without a conviction might indicate that she's more likely to engage in criminal behavior again because she hasn't faced the same consequences as someone who's been convicted before. So that's another medium risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are within the average range, so I don't think physical factors play a big role here. It's more about behavioral or situational factors.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she has more freedom to engage in risky behaviors without supervision. Being single could also be associated with higher risk-taking activities, so that's another medium factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having completed high school is generally positive, but not being in college might indicate she's not pursuing further education or stable employment, which can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. So that's a medium risk.\n\nShe has held four jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so having multiple jobs suggests she's motivated and perhaps less likely to engage in criminal activities. That might lower her risk, making this a low factor.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's recent. However, not feeling depressed could indicate she's managing her mental health well, which might mitigate some risks. So maybe medium here.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a rural area. Growing up in a stable family environment is protective against criminal behavior. But since she's now living alone and has been arrested, the influence of her upbringing might be less relevant. Still, it's a positive factor, so low risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God or religion. Lack of spiritual beliefs can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors because there's no perceived consequences. So that's a medium risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the highest risk factors are her age and history of arrest, followed by drug use and lack of belief in religion. The lower factors are her education level and stable employment. So overall, she has a moderate to high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in criminal behavior due to less experience with consequences\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Arrest rates and conviction disparities may influence recidivism, but not directly predictive here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction may indicate higher likelihood of future engagement\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase risk-taking freedom\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is positive; not in college may reduce stability\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Multiple jobs suggest stability and lower risk-taking\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may indicate better mental health management\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing is protective, but current situation may outweigh it\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief can correlate with higher risk-taking\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
