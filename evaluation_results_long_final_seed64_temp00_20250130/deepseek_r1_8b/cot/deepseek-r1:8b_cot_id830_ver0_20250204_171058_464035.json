    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male who's been arrested twice and convicted. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: Hispanic male, 5'9\", 260 lbs. He's never married and lives alone. Having a high school diploma but not in college. Held one job last year. Past drug use, specifically marijuana, and he's been feeling down lately. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area with three people. He believes in God's influence on his life.\n\nStarting with criminal history: two arrests and convictions. That's a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nNext, drug use. He used marijuana recently, which is a significant factor linked to recidivism. So that's another high.\n\nHis living situation: urban area, large household when young. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. Plus, growing up in a bigger family might mean less supervision or different role models. That seems like a medium risk.\n\nHe feels down recently. Depression can lead to poor decision-making and increased criminal behavior. So that's another medium factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: He thinks God affects his life personally. Religion can sometimes be protective, but it can also be used to justify actions if someone believes they're acting according to their faith. That might be a medium risk because it could influence his behavior in unpredictable ways.\n\nEmployment: Held one job last year. Stable employment is usually a positive factor, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. So that's low risk.\n\nAge: 21 years old. Younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism compared to older adults. That's medium.\n\nEducation: High school diploma but not in college. Higher education levels are linked to lower recidivism rates, so this is a low factor.\n\nLifestyle factors like living alone might increase risk because there's no one to monitor or intervene in negative behaviors. So that's medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risks are criminal history and drug use, both high. The others are medium: urban background, depression, religion, age, and lifestyle. Employment and education are low.\n\nSo, considering these factors, the prediction is likely \"YES\" with high confidence because of the significant criminal history and ongoing issues like drug use and emotional distress.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"urban_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"lifestyle\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
