    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part of her history step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White and 5'5\", 135 lbs. Not sure how relevant physical build is, but maybe it's a factor in how authorities perceive her or if there's any history of violence based on body type stereotypes. I'll note that as medium.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone might mean she has more access to drugs or can engage in risky behavior without supervision. That could be high risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which is positive. Education often correlates with lower recidivism because it provides structure and opportunities. So that's low risk.\n\nShe hasn't held a job this year. Unemployment can be a stressor leading to criminal behavior, so that might be medium risk.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism, especially if she's still using. High risk here.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can lead to substance abuse or criminal behavior, but since it's not current, maybe lower risk.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences. That's medium risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes God plays a role in her life. Religion can provide support and deter criminal activity, so that's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risks are drug use and living alone. The prediction is likely \"YES\" with high confidence around 80% because of these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"physical_build\", \"medium\", \"Height and weight may influence perceptions or past behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"high\", \"Living alone may increase access to risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High education level typically reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can be a stressor leading to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression may reduce risk associated with mental health\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing increases exposure to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can deter criminal activity\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
