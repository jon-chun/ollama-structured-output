    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's a Black male, which is often associated with higher recidivism rates. But since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe that's a good sign. He's 6'2\" and 230 lbs, which might make him more imposing, but I'm not sure how that affects risk.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone now, which could mean he doesn't have the support system that might prevent him from reoffending. Being enrolled in school suggests he has a structure, which is positive. Holding two jobs shows responsibility, which is also a good sign.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Past drug use can be a risk factor, but not using currently might reduce that risk.\n\nHe grew up in a large household in an urban area with his biological mother. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which could increase his risk. His religious beliefs about God's influence on his life might provide him with a sense of purpose or guidance, potentially reducing recidivism.\n\nArrest history: Two arrests without convictions. Maybe he was charged but not convicted, so he hasn't been through the system yet. That might mean he hasn't learned from previous interactions with law enforcement.\n\nPutting it all together, his current responsibilities (school and work) are positive, but his past drug use and urban upbringing are risks. His lack of conviction history is a plus. His religious beliefs could help him avoid future issues. So overall, I think the risk is medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"Black male demographic associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without support system\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in school showing responsibility\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Held two jobs indicating stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use could pose risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Urban upbringing with large household\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs may provide guidance and purpose\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 230 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
