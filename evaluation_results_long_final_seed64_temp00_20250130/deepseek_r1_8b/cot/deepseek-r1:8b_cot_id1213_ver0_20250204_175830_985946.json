    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her background and see how it might influence her likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's a young woman, 19, which is typically a higher risk age group for recidivism because they're more impulsive and might have less experience with decision-making. That could be a high factor.\n\nShe identifies as Black. I know that racial disparities often play a role in the criminal justice system, but here it's about her personal background and how it might affect her behavior. Maybe being part of a marginalized group increases her risk, so that's probably medium.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. That suggests she might have some familiarity with the legal system, which could either make her more cautious or more likely to reoffend if she feels frustrated. I'm leaning towards medium here because it shows she knows the system a bit, but without a conviction, it's not a strong indicator.\n\nHer physical description: 5'6\" and 190 lbs. Not sure how much weight plays into criminal behavior, but being overweight can sometimes be linked to socioeconomic factors that contribute to recidivism. Maybe medium.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the same level of supervision or support as someone in a family setting. That could increase her risk, so high here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is a strong protective factor. Being in college suggests she's motivated and less likely to engage in criminal activities, so that's low.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, both of which reduce recidivism risks. So that's another low factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Lack of substance abuse is a big plus because it reduces impulsive behavior. Not feeling depressed also indicates she's mentally stable, so high protection there. That would lower her risk factors, maybe medium overall.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. Plus, family issues can contribute to delinquency. So that's a medium factor.\n\nHer religious beliefs about God influencing her life might provide her with a sense of purpose or moral guidance, which could deter criminal behavior. That's another protective factor, so low.\n\nPutting it all together: high for age, medium for race and living situation, medium for arrest history, medium for employment, low for education and religion, and maybe medium for substance use and depression. Overall, her factors seem to balance towards lower risk, but she's still young and has some exposure to the system. I'm not entirely sure if it tips towards YES or NO, but my confidence is around 60% because of her positive aspects like education and no recent issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases risk due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction suggests system familiarity\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"Weight and height don't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"high\", \"Living alone may lack supervision and support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment indicate motivation\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Job holding provides stability reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"No recent drug use reduces impulsive behavior risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"No depression indicates mental stability\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with family issues increases risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs provide moral guidance potentially deterring crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
