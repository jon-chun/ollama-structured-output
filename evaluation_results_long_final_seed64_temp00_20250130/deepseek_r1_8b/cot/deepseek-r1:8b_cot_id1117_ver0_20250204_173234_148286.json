    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male who's been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's Black, 5'8\", 161 lbs. Being a young male can sometimes be a factor in criminal behavior, especially if there are other contributing elements. His race might also play into systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly affects recidivism without more context.\n\nHe hasn't been convicted, which is a good sign because convictions often correlate with higher recidivism rates. But he's been arrested twice, so there's some history of involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant risk factor because it limits employment opportunities and can lead to economic struggles, which are linked to higher crime rates.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year, which is concerning. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as individuals may feel disconnected from society or experience financial stress.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically cocaine. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator of future criminality, but combined with other factors like unemployment and lack of education, it could be a higher risk factor.\n\nHe feels down sometimes and considers that God doesn't affect his life personally. This suggests possible mental health issues or a lack of coping mechanisms, which can contribute to criminal behavior as individuals might turn to illegal activities when facing personal struggles.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with a household of four, including his biological mother. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences from a young age can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHis lack of religious beliefs or connection to faith could mean he lacks a support system that might otherwise deter him from criminal behavior.\n\nHe's been arrested but not convicted, which is a point in his favor. However, the fact that he's been arrested twice shows some involvement with the justice system, which can sometimes lead to more criminal activity if not addressed properly.\n\nPutting it all together: race (maybe medium), lack of education (high), unemployment (high), drug use (medium-high), mental health indicators (medium), urban background (medium), and lack of faith (medium). \n\nI think each of these factors contributes, but the most significant ones are his lack of education and unemployment, which can really increase risk. His drug use is also a notable factor. So I'd rate them as medium to high.\n\nConsidering all this, it's more likely he'll be rearrested within three years. My confidence isn't 100% because there are positive aspects like no convictions yet, but the combination of these factors makes it a significant risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black demographic and potential systemic issues\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits opportunities\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"No job held during the year increases risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent cocaine use contributes to higher risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and lack of faith in religion may indicate issues\"),\n    (\"urban_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment with exposure to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"faith\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious beliefs may reduce deterrence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 161 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
