    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: Hispanic male, 5'9\", 199 lbs. He's never married and lives alone. That might indicate some independence, but also possible social isolation. His education level is low since he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. Not having higher education could be a risk factor for future issues.\n\nHe has held three jobs this year, which shows some stability, but it's only part-time or temporary positions. Work history can influence recidivism; stable employment might reduce the likelihood, but if they're low-skilled jobs, maybe not as protective.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana in the past four years. Recent use could increase risk of rearrest, especially if there are pending charges or if substance abuse contributes to criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate he's managing his drug use better now.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five when young. That's a big family unit, which can sometimes lead to higher risk factors due to exposure to criminal influences or chaotic environments. On the other hand, it might have provided some support.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religion can be a protective factor, promoting prosocial behavior and reducing recidivism. But if it's used in a way that justifies criminal actions, it could be a risk.\n\nArrest history: One arrest but no conviction. This might mean he's at the threshold of entering the criminal justice system. If this is his first significant interaction with law enforcement, it's a moderate indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, factors like education and employment are low, which are risks. Drug use is medium. Family structure is medium as a risk. Religion is medium as a protective factor. Arrest history is medium. His current situation shows some stability but also areas where he might struggle.\n\nI think the overall risk is medium to high because while there are some protective factors like employment and religion, the lack of education, past drug use, and family background could increase his chances of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of high school diploma or GED increases risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Stable employment can reduce risk but low-skilled jobs may not provide enough protection\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent marijuana use is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a large household may expose to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Religious beliefs can be protective but may not fully counteract other risks\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: One arrest without conviction indicates potential for further interaction with justice system\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
