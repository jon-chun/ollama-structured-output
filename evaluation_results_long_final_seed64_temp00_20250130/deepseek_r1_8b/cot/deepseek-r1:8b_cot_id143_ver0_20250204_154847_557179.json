    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman who hasn't been convicted but has been arrested once. Let me go through each part of her history step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White and 5'7\", 155 lbs. Not sure how relevant height and weight are here, but maybe they can affect behavior or stress levels. She's never married and lives alone, which might mean she lacks support systems. That could be a risk factor because isolation can lead to more criminal activity.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree and isn't in college now. Education level is important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. But since she's not enrolled, maybe that's a concern if she's not finding stable work or support.\n\nShe's held four jobs this year, which is good. Employment stability can reduce criminal behavior because it provides structure and income. So that might be a positive factor, but I need to see how it interacts with other factors.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Plus, she's been feeling down lately, which could indicate stress or instability. Stress can lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with both parents, so a stable but possibly stressful household. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. Her upbringing might influence her current behavior.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God, which is an agnostic view. Spirituality can play a role in providing emotional support or moral guidance. Without that, she might struggle with decision-making, increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a history of drug use, feels stressed, lacks social support, and has some positive indicators like education and employment. The key high-risk factors are the recent drug use and current stress. The lack of social support is also a concern. Her education might mitigate some risks, but her drug use and stress are more impactful.\n\nSo, I think she's at medium to high risk. But considering she hasn't been convicted yet and has stable employment, maybe it's medium-high. However, the recent drug use and stress are strong indicators, so perhaps high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is a common age for risk assessment but not inherently high risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender can be a low-risk factor as it may correlate with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race is not inherently a high-risk factor in criminal justice risk assessment\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Never married and living alone can increase risk due to lack of support systems\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Bachelor's degree is positive but not sufficient alone\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Four jobs in a year indicate stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant high-risk factor\"),\n    (\"stress_level\", \"high\", \"Feeling down recently indicates potential instability and higher risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with both parents may increase exposure to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Lack of belief in God can reduce support systems and moral guidance\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
