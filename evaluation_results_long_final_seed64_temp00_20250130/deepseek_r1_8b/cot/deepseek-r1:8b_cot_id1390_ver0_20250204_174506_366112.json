    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor. I know that age can be a factor\u2014yOUNGER people might have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals. But I'm not sure if being 20 is particularly high or low. Also, his race is white, which might influence sentencing or other factors, but I'm not certain how significant that is in risk assessment.\n\nHe has been arrested five times and convicted. That's a strong indicator because a history of arrests and convictions directly correlates with future rearrests. Five arrests suggest he's had multiple opportunities to reoffend, so this should be a high factor.\n\nHis physical description: 6'3\" and between 200-224 lbs. I don't know if body size is a significant risk factor, but being heavier might have some association with substance abuse or other issues, but without more info, it's probably low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might mean less supervision or support. But not having been married isn't always a negative; some people choose to live solo for various reasons. So maybe medium.\n\nEducation: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits employment and life opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior. This should be high.\n\nEmployment: He held one job during the year. Having some employment can indicate stability, which might reduce recidivism. So this could be low or medium. Since he only had one job, maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: He hasn't used drugs in four years. No recent drug use is positive because it reduces the immediate risk of substance-related offenses. This should be a low factor.\n\nDepression: He hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, but if he's not currently experiencing it, maybe this isn't a significant factor. So low.\n\nFamily background: Lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can have negative influences. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal activities. This is likely medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe God affects his life personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor because it provides moral support and community ties. Without that, maybe this increases risk, so high.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are arrest history (high), education (high), family background (medium), religious beliefs (high). The others like employment and depression are lower. So overall, he's at a higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"history of multiple arrests and convictions directly correlates with future recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"lack of education limits employment opportunities and increases criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"urban upbringing may expose to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"absence of religious beliefs may reduce protective factors\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"holding one job indicates some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no recent drug use reduces immediate substance-related offense risk\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"current lack of depression is positive\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"white demographic may influence sentencing but impact is unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
