    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his background and see how it might contribute to the likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, he's an 18-year-old, which is pretty young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills and might not fully grasp the consequences of their actions yet. That makes me think this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know that racial factors can influence sentencing and probation rates, but in this case, he hasn't been convicted, so maybe his race isn't directly affecting his current situation. Still, it's something to note because some studies show differences in how the criminal justice system interacts with different demographics.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That means he might have a history of getting into trouble, which could indicate higher risk. People who've been arrested before are more likely to reoffend if not given proper intervention or supervision.\n\nHis physical description is 6'9\" and 185 lbs. I'm not sure how much body size factors into criminal behavior, but being larger might make him more intimidating, possibly leading to more confrontations or situations where he feels the need to assert himself, which could contribute to further arrests.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be both good and bad. On one hand, it gives him more freedom, which might lead to higher risk-taking behavior. On the other hand, having no one around to monitor or intervene in his actions might increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having a diploma is a positive indicator because it's associated with lower recidivism rates compared to those without. However, not being in college means he might be more likely to engage in criminal activities if he's looking for stimulation or excitement.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so having only one job might not be as strong as having a steady job. Still, it shows he has some responsibility, which could mitigate risk factors.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Marijuana is commonly associated with criminal behavior, even if it's not as severe as other drugs. His recent use (within the past year) might increase his chances of getting rearrest.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Depression can lead to higher criminal activity because of issues like impulsivity and poor decision-making. If he's not currently experiencing depression, that's a positive sign, but I don't know about his history beyond that single point in time.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four. Growing up in a stable family environment is protective against delinquency. However, he considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life, which might indicate a lack of spiritual or belief-based support, potentially increasing risk.\n\nPutting all this together, I think the key factors are his age, history of arrest, drug use, and family background. His age is a strong indicator, as younger people tend to recidivate more. The fact that he's been arrested but not convicted suggests he might have some issues with self-control or getting into situations that lead to arrests.\n\nHis drug use is another major factor. Recent marijuana use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. The lack of depression might help, but without knowing his past mental health, it's hard to assess that fully.\n\nThe stable family background is a positive, but his lack of belief in God could mean he doesn't have a support system or moral framework that might deter him from criminal activities.\n\nI'm also considering the fact that he hasn't been convicted yet. Sometimes, being arrested without conviction can be a sign that he's been involved in situations where he could have been charged but wasn't, which might indicate lower severity or more minor offenses.\n\nIn terms of prediction, I think there's a moderate risk. He has several factors that push towards higher risk, like age and drug use, but some protective factors like education and family. However, without more information on his mental health or social support, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, I'd assign high risk to age, arrest history, and drug use. The family background is medium because while it's positive, the lack of belief in God might counteract that a bit. His current mental state and employment are low risk factors, as they don't significantly increase his chances compared to the others.\n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards a prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest within three years with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates due to developing decision-making skills\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Arrest without conviction indicates potential behavioral issues\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Stable family environment is protective, but lack of belief in God may increase risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression; limited info on past history\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma reduces recidivism risk compared to those without\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"One job shows responsibility, mitigating some risk factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
