    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me go through each part of his background step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White and identifies as such. That might be relevant in terms of societal or systemic biases, but I'm not sure how much that directly affects recidivism risk. Maybe it's a low factor since it doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. This is interesting because arrest records don't always lead to convictions. It suggests he might have had charges dropped or acquitted, which could mean he's less likely to reoffend if he's not been convicted before. So I think this factor might be low in terms of risk.\n\nHis physical description: 5'7\" and 140 lbs. Not sure how height and weight directly contribute to criminal behavior. Maybe it's more about other factors like socioeconomic status or mental health, so I'll consider this a low factor.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate he has more freedom or less supervision, which could increase risk. But without knowing his financial stability or social support, it's hard to say. Maybe medium risk here because living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level is usually a positive indicator, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. So this should be a low factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, which might reduce recidivism. So another low factor here.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor, so this should be high. However, not feeling depressed could mitigate that risk a bit, but overall, drug use is still a strong indicator.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable household might have provided him with better support systems. Urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates, so maybe this is medium risk because of the environment.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God or that God affects his life personally. Religiosity can influence behavior, but without strong ties to a faith community, it's hard to say how much this impacts recidivism. Maybe low since it's more about personal belief than institutional support.\n\nPutting all these together: arrests without convictions (low), education (low), employment (low), drug use (high), family background (medium), living situation (medium), and lack of religion (low). The high factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors are family and living situation. Low factors don't contribute as much.\n\nSo the prediction would lean towards \"YES\" he will be rearrested in three years. Confidence is around 70% because while there's a high risk from drug use, other factors might mitigate it slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Race may have systemic impacts but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism alone\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Arrests without convictions may indicate lower likelihood of reoffending\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Physical characteristics don't directly predict criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone might increase risk through reduced supervision\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Higher education reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Employment provides stability and reduces crime risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Stable upbringing may reduce risk, urban area increases exposure to crime\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of belief doesn't directly correlate with higher recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
