    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, her demographic: she's Hispanic, 5'3\", 110 lbs. She's never married and lives alone. Having a GED and working five jobs suggests some stability, which might lower the risk factors. But she's using drugs like marijuana and cocaine recently, which is a red flag for recidivism.\n\nHer mental state: feeling down a lot in the past month. That could mean she's dealing with depression or stress, which can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism. She also mentions that God plays a role in her life, which might influence her decision-making and risk-taking behaviors.\n\nShe has a history of living in an urban area with both parents, which is a stable environment, but she's now on her own, which could be challenging. Being young when her parents were together might have given her some resilience or different coping skills compared to others her age who grew up in more chaotic households.\n\nHer past arrest without a conviction is interesting. It shows she's been involved with the criminal justice system before, but she hasn't been convicted yet. This could mean she's at risk of continuing behavior that might lead to further arrests or convictions.\n\nLooking at her employment: five jobs in a year suggests she's motivated and has some structure in her life, which is positive. But drug use can interfere with work, so that's something to consider.\n\nHer drug use is recent (past four years) and includes both marijuana and cocaine, which are serious drugs. Current use can increase the risk of rearrest because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\n\nHer mental state being a concern could mean she's more likely to engage in risky behaviors as a way to cope. This ties into higher recidivism rates seen in individuals with untreated mental health issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think her age is a medium risk factor. She's an adult but still young, which can influence decision-making and the likelihood of reoffending. Her current drug use is high risk because it's recent and involves more serious substances. Her mental state is another high risk factor as feeling down could indicate underlying issues that need attention.\n\nHer past arrest without a conviction might be a medium risk since it shows some involvement but not a history of convictions yet. Her living situation is low risk because she has her own place, which can provide stability.\n\nOverall, the combination of drug use and mental health concerns are significant. The fact that she's been arrested before adds to the risk, even if she hasn't been convicted. Her employment suggests some structure but doesn't negate the impact of substance abuse and mental health.\n\nI'm a bit unsure about her being Hispanic and how that might influence recidivism rates. I know there are disparities in the criminal justice system, but without specific data on how her ethnicity affects her risk, it's hard to assign a weight. Maybe it's a low factor because it doesn't directly relate to her current situation as much as the others.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are drug use and mental health. The past arrest is medium, and living alone is low. Her age is also a consideration but might be medium since she's an adult making decisions that could lead to further issues.\n\nSo, I think the prediction would lean towards \"YES\" because of the significant high risk factors. My confidence isn't 100% because there are positive aspects like her employment and living situation, but the negative factors are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: She is an adult, which increases the likelihood of decision-making that could lead to further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent use of marijuana and cocaine significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Feeling down frequently may indicate underlying issues that can lead to risky behaviors\"),\n    (\"past_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Arrest without conviction shows involvement in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone provides some stability, reducing risk factors related to environment\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: GED and five jobs indicate structure, which can deter criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
