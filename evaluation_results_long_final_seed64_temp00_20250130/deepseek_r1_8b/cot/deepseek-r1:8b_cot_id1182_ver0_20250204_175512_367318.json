    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who has been arrested seven times and convicted. He's Black, lives alone, hasn't married, has a high school diploma, works two jobs, uses marijuana in the past four years, isn't currently depressed, grew up in an urban household with his biological mother, and believes in God's influence on his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each factor and assign a weight. Let me think about each one:\n\n1. Race: Being Black is often associated with higher recidivism rates. So this might be a high risk factor.\n2. Criminal History: He has been arrested seven times and convicted, which suggests he's had multiple opportunities to change behavior without success. High risk here too.\n3. Age: 21 is considered young adulthood, where decision-making can be impulsive. Maybe medium.\n4. Employment: Holding two jobs shows some responsibility, so this could reduce risk. Probably low.\n5. Education: Having a high school diploma is positive; maybe medium since it's not college-level.\n6. Drug Use: He has used marijuana recently. Recurrent drug use is linked to higher recidivism. High risk here.\n7. Mental Health: Not depressed currently, but past issues aren't mentioned. Maybe low unless there's a history.\n8. Family Structure: Growing up in a large urban household might have exposed him to more stressors. Could be medium.\n9. Religiosity: Believing in God might provide some structure, so maybe low.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" he will be rearrested within three years. Confidence is around 70% because while several high-risk factors exist (criminal history, race, drug use), there are also protective factors like employment and education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"7 arrests and convictions indicate persistent issues\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 is young adulthood, associated with impulsive decisions\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs shows responsibility and stability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma suggests some structure but no college\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use links to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not currently depressed, but history isn't detailed\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose to stressors\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might offer structure\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 142 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
