    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's Black, 5'10\", 155 lbs. Being a young male involved in the criminal justice system is a known risk factor. I think that's a high risk because younger males often have higher recidivism rates due to less life experience and peer influences.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support of family, which can increase risks. So that's probably medium.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is positive, but he hasn't held a job this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it may lead to financial stress or boredom, increasing criminal involvement. That seems like a high risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years but was feeling down recently. Recent emotional distress could increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism. So that's another high risk.\n\nHis upbringing: grew up with both parents in a large household in a rural area. A stable family background is usually protective, so that's low risk.\n\nHe believes in God and personal involvement of religion. Religiosity can be protective by providing moral support and reducing criminal behavior, so that's medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors are: age, employment, recent emotional state, and religiosity. The high factors are age, unemployment, and emotional distress. Medium is religiosity. Low is family background.\n\nSo, prediction is YES with high confidence because multiple high-risk factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young males often have higher recidivism rates due to less life experience and peer influences\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial stress or boredom, increasing criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"emotional_distress\", \"high\", \"Recent emotional distress may increase likelihood of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral support and reduce criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"A stable family background is protective against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in a rural area.
