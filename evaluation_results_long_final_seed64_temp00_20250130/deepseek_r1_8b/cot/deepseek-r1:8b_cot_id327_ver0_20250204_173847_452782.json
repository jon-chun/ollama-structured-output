    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of being rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's 18 and hasn't been convicted yet. That makes me think she's still pretty young in the criminal justice system. Younger people often have less experience with the system, which can lead to more mistakes or poor decisions. So I'm leaning towards this being a medium risk factor because her age is a significant indicator.\n\nShe identifies as Black. I know that race can play a role in how the criminal justice system interacts with individuals. There's a lot of research showing disparities, so being part of a marginalized group might increase her risk. This seems like it could be a high factor because systemic issues can affect how she's treated after arrest.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and 140 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stature directly affects recidivism, but being underweight or smaller build might make her more vulnerable in certain situations. Maybe in custody or during interactions with law enforcement, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is not living alone. Living with others might provide some support, which can reduce the chances of getting into trouble. But on the flip side, living with others might mean she's more exposed to negative influences or stressors. I'm thinking this is a low factor because family support could be protective.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase stress, which might lead to criminal behavior. This seems like a medium risk since education is a key indicator for future outcomes.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Having steady employment suggests she has some structure in her life, which can deter criminal activity. So this could be a low factor because work provides stability and reduces risks.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down during the past month. Drug use is a clear risk factor for recidivism. The fact that she's using marijuana recently increases her chances, so this is definitely a high factor.\n\nShe grew up in a big household in an urban area. Big families can offer more support, but urban areas often have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal influences. This might be a medium factor because while family support is there, the environment could still pose risks.\n\nHer belief in God's influence on her life could provide her with a sense of purpose or moral guidance, which might reduce recidivism. So this is probably a low factor as religious beliefs can act as a protective measure.\n\nPutting it all together, I think she has some risk factors that are medium to high, but there are also some low ones. The main high factors are her recent drug use and being Black. The medium factors include her age, lack of education, and living situation. The low factors are her employment, family structure, and religious beliefs.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about the exact weights, but based on what I know, this analysis seems reasonable. It's a bit nuanced because each factor interacts with others, so it's hard to isolate them perfectly. But overall, considering all these points, I think she has a moderate risk of being rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have less experience with the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Research shows racial disparities in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"physical_stature\", \"medium\", \"Physical build can affect interactions with law enforcement and custody\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide support or expose to negative influences\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities and increases stress\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Steady employment provides stability reducing criminal activity\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a clear risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban areas have higher crime rates despite family support\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs can provide moral guidance and reduce recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
