Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's a White male, which might be relevant because some studies show racial disparities in recidivism, but I'm not sure if it's a strong factor here. Maybe medium.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and between 150-174 lbs. Height and weight aren't usually big predictors, so probably low.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is not living alone. Living situation can affect risk; living alone might mean more access to drugs or opportunities for crime, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence employment and life choices, which are protective factors. So that's probably low.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial stress or criminal activity. That seems like medium.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism, so high.\n\nHe feels down sometimes, which could indicate emotional issues that might contribute to criminal behavior. Maybe medium.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Family structure can influence outcomes; larger families might provide more support or maybe less supervision. I'm not sure how impactful this is, so perhaps low.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God. Religiosity can be a protective factor, so lack thereof might increase risk\u2014maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use is the highest risk factor. His joblessness and feelings of being down are also significant. The rest are lower but still contribute. So overall prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"White male\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"6 feet 1 inch, 150-174 lbs\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Not married and not living alone\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma, not enrolled in college\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held during the year\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in past four years\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Felt down sometimes in the past month\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of 4 in rural area\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Does not believe in God\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
