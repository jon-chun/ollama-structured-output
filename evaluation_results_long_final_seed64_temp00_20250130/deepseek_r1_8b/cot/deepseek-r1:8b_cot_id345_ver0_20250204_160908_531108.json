    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old male who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. I know that younger people, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are more likely to reoffend because they have less experience with the consequences of their actions and may have fewer ties to the community. So, I think this is a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. From what I've read, racial factors can influence recidivism rates, but it's a bit complex. Some studies show that Black individuals are overrepresented in recidivism statistics, which might mean higher risk for them. However, being White doesn't automatically mean low risk, so maybe this is medium.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Having a criminal history increases the likelihood of future arrests. So, this should be high.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 128 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stats directly affect recidivism, but being under or over a certain weight might relate to substance use or health issues that could contribute to criminal behavior. Maybe medium.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be both good and bad. Without a support system, he might struggle more, increasing risk. So, high.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is important; higher education can reduce recidivism by providing better opportunities. Not being in college could mean lower educational attainment, so maybe medium to high.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs in the year. Employment is a strong protective factor. More stable employment reduces crime rates because of financial stability and structure. So, this should be low risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent. However, not feeling depressed might indicate better mental health, which could mitigate some risks. Maybe medium.\n\nAt 20, he lived with both parents in a rural area. Growing up with both parents is protective, providing emotional and financial support. So, low risk here.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it provides moral support and social ties. So, this should be low.\n\nPutting it all together: age (high), criminal history (high), employment (low), education (medium), drug use (medium), family background (low), religiosity (low). The prediction would lean towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Youthful age increases risk of recidivism due to lack of life experience and exposure to consequences\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"While racial factors can influence recidivism, being White doesn't automatically determine risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Previous arrest and conviction directly correlate with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"physical_stats\", \"medium\", \"Under/over weight may relate to substance use or health issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase risk due to lack of support and supervision\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Not being in college may indicate lower educational attainment, a known recidivism risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment provides structure reducing crime likelihood\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in a stable environment is protective\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral support and reduce criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
