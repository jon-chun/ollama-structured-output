    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his background step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's an 18-year-old, which is pretty young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they might be less developed in decision-making and impulse control. So that's a point in favor of higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race directly correlates with recidivism, but some studies suggest that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, so maybe this is a medium factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is better than not, but not having further education could be a risk factor because it limits opportunities and might contribute to higher unemployment rates, which are linked to crime.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A history of arrest can sometimes predict future behavior, especially if there's a pattern or underlying issues that led to the arrest. So this is probably medium.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 230 lbs. Being overweight might contribute to health issues, which could lead to substance abuse or other problems that increase criminal activity. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 can be isolating, especially if there are no supportive family members nearby. Isolation often leads to higher risk-taking behaviors, so this is probably medium.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't a direct indicator of future crime, but it's a significant factor because substance abuse can impair judgment and lead to more risky decisions. This is definitely high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a form of self-harm or coping mechanism, so not being depressed might lower the risk a bit. So this could be low.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with adults who weren't his biological parents in a rural area. Growing up without stable parental figures can have long-term effects on behavior and self-regulation. Rural areas might also have different social dynamics that could influence crime rates. This is likely high because it's a significant environmental factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be protective against criminal behavior, but if he's using this belief as a justification for his actions, it might actually increase his risk by providing a moral rationale for misconduct. So this could be medium or high depending on how it's used.\n\nPutting all these together, I think the factors that stand out are: age, substance use, living situation, and upbringing. These seem to have the highest impact, so I'll assign them as high risk. The others like race, education level, past arrest record, and current mental state are medium or low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals often exhibit higher rates of recidivism due to immature decision-making\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Racial disparities in the criminal justice system can influence recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"A GED indicates some educational attainment, which may reduce recidivism risk compared to no education\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Previous arrest without conviction can sometimes predict future behavior\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"high\", \"Obesity is linked to health issues that can contribute to criminal activity\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may lead to isolation and higher risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use impairs judgment and increases the likelihood of risky decisions\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may indicate lower risk compared to those experiencing depression\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"high\", \"Growing without stable parental figures can lead to behavioral issues and higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective, but if used to justify actions, they might increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
