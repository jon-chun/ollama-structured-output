    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of his background and see how it might contribute to the likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, he's an 18-year-old, which is pretty young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills and might not fully grasp the consequences of their actions yet. So that's a point in favor of a higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know that racial factors can influence outcomes in the criminal justice system, but it's a bit tricky because sometimes there's systemic issues involved. However, in terms of recidivism, being White doesn't necessarily mean higher or lower risk on its own. It might not be a major factor here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting. Sometimes an arrest without a conviction can indicate that the charges were dropped or dismissed, which might suggest he wasn't a high risk to reoffend in that particular case. But it could also mean he was close to being charged and might have similar behavior again.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 165 lbs. Not sure how physical build plays into recidivism, but I don't think it has a direct correlation. Maybe if he's more likely to engage in physical altercations or something, but that's speculative.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the same level of supervision or support as someone in a family setting. That could increase the risk because he's more on his own to make decisions without guidance.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is positive, but not having further education can sometimes be a risk factor because it might limit job opportunities and lead to higher unemployment rates, which are linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. That's a good sign. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, both of which can deter criminal activity. So this might lower his recidivism risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Recent drug use could be a factor, but since it's been recent, it might indicate he's still experimenting or dealing with substance issues. However, not feeling depressed recently suggests he's managing his mental health, which can be protective against certain behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of six with both biological parents in an urban area. A big family and urban environment can sometimes lead to higher stressors and more exposure to criminal influences. Urban areas often have more crime and opportunities for delinquent behavior.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That's a personal belief, which might influence his decision-making or how he handles challenges. It could be either a protective factor if it helps him make positive choices or a risk factor if it leads to risky behaviors influenced by religious beliefs.\n\nPutting this all together: Young age is a high risk factor. Arrest without conviction is medium because it shows some involvement with the system but not a conviction. Employment is low, which is good. Drug use is medium since it's recent and could indicate higher risk. Family background is medium as urban environments can be challenging. His personal beliefs are unclear, so I'll consider them medium because it's a less direct factor.\n\nSo, each factor's weight: Young age (high), Arrest without conviction (medium), Employment (low), Drug use (medium), Family background (medium), Beliefs (medium). Combining these, the overall risk is moderate to high. I'm leaning towards YES with high confidence because several factors point towards higher recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases risk due to immaturity in decision-making\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_status\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction may indicate behavioral tendencies\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment provides stability, reducing criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use can indicate higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with large family increases exposure to stressors\"),\n    (\"religion_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Personal beliefs may influence decision-making and behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
