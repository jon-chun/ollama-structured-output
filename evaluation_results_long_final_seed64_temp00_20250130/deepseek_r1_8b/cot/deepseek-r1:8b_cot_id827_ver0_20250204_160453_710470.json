    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested 10 times and convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. I know that younger people, especially around this age, are more likely to reoffend because they're still developing better decision-making skills. So, high risk there.\n\nHe identifies as White. From what I've read, racial factors can influence recidivism rates, but it's a bit nuanced. Some studies show higher rates among certain groups, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe has 10 arrests and convictions. That's a strong indicator of prior criminal history, which usually correlates with higher recidivism. So, high risk.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 160 lbs. I'm not sure how much physical build affects recidivism, but being within a normal weight range might not be a big factor. Maybe low or medium.\n\nNever married and living alone now. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because it might lead to more unsupervised time, which could increase criminal activity. So, maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a significant predictor of recidivism. Without these, he's less likely to have job opportunities or coping skills, so high risk here.\n\nHe held 1 job last year. Having some employment history might indicate he can hold down a job, which could reduce recidivism. So, low or medium.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a strong predictor of criminal behavior, especially for younger males. High risk here.\n\nHasn't felt depressed in the past month. Depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism, but if he's not currently depressed, maybe it's less of a factor. So, low or medium.\n\nAt a young age, lived in a household of 3. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support or more chaotic environments. It could go either way, so maybe medium.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior; if it's a positive influence, it might lower risk. Without knowing the specifics, it's hard, but maybe low.\n\nPutting this all together: age is high, criminal history is high, education is high, drug use is high. Those are strong indicators. His employment and current mental state might mitigate some factors, but overall, the high ones outweigh them. So, prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger age increases risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"10 arrests and convictions indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Within normal weight range, less impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase unsupervised time\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"1 job held indicates some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not currently depressed may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Large household could be chaotic\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might provide support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
