    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman who's been arrested twice and convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From what I know, younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they might be less likely to change their behavior. So that's probably a medium risk there.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race directly affects recidivism, but some studies suggest systemic issues might influence outcomes. It might be low since it's just her identity without more context.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and convicted once. Having a criminal history is a strong indicator of higher risk. So that's definitely high.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and 135 lbs. Body size doesn't inherently predict behavior, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean she lacks support, which could increase risk, so maybe medium.\n\nHigh school diploma, not in college. Education level can affect employment and stability, which are protective factors. So that's a positive, probably low.\n\nShe has held 5 jobs in the year. Stable employment is good, so that's another protective factor, likely low.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use itself isn't always a red flag, but recent use could be concerning. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate she's managing her mental state. So maybe medium.\n\nAt a young age, lived in a household of 3. Growing up in a larger family might provide more support or different influences. Not sure if that's directly related to recidivism, so low.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God involved in her personal life. Religion can be a protective factor, promoting prosocial behavior. So probably low.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors with high risk are criminal history and age. The others seem less concerning. So overall prediction is YES with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to less time for behavioral change\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself does not directly correlate with recidivism without systemic factors\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested and convicted is a strong indicator of higher risk\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"low\", \"Body size does not inherently predict behavior or recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Education level can influence stability and employment, which are protective factors\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is a positive indicator for reduced recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use could indicate higher risk behavior, though not determinative alone\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a larger household may provide different influences but does not directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can promote prosocial behavior, acting as a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
