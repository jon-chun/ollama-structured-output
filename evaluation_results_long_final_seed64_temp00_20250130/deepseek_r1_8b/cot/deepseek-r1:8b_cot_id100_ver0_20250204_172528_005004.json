    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old male who's been arrested nine times and convicted. He's American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut, lives alone, hasn't worked in a year, dropped out of high school, used marijuana in the past four years, doesn't feel depressed now, and at a young age lived in a household of eight. He also believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes.\n\nFirst, I should consider each factor one by one. Age is 19, which is relatively young, so that's probably a medium risk because younger people might have more opportunities for change but also higher likelihoods of recidivism. His ethnicity is American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut; I think this group often faces unique challenges, so that's another medium factor.\n\nHe has nine arrests and convictions, which is high. That's a strong indicator he's involved in criminal behavior, so that's definitely a high risk factor. He's never married and lives alone now, but he might have had chaotic family environments before, which could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHis education level is no diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\u2014this lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates, so that's medium. Unemployment for a year suggests he's not holding steady work, which can lead to criminal behavior due to economic stress, so that's another medium factor.\n\nHe used marijuana recently (past four years), which is a drug crime and indicates substance abuse issues. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, so high. He doesn't feel depressed now, but past depression or mental health issues could have contributed to his behavior, so maybe low here since he's not currently reporting it.\n\nHe comes from a large household of eight\u2014chaotic environments can lead to higher criminality, so that's medium. His belief in God's influence on his life might provide him with a sense of structure or purpose, which could lower his risk compared to others without such beliefs, so maybe low here.\n\nPutting this all together: high for arrests and substance use, medium for age, ethnicity, education, unemployment, and family size, and low for depression and belief. So the prediction is YES with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates due to less time for behavioral change\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut communities often face unique challenges contributing to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Nine arrests and convictions indicate a strong history of criminal activity\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to economic stress, increasing criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use indicates ongoing substance abuse issues\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No current depression reported; past issues may not be as relevant here\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"Large household size at a young age can contribute to chaotic environments\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence might provide structure, potentially reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
