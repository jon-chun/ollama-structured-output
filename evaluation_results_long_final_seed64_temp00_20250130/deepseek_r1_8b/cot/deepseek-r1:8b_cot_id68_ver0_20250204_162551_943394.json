    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old female who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. From what I know, younger people, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are more likely to reoffend because they have less experience with the consequences of their actions and may have fewer ties to the community. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race is a significant factor here, but some studies suggest that racial disparities exist in recidivism rates. However, since she's only been arrested once, maybe it's not a huge factor. I'll consider this medium because the impact might not be as direct without more information.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. Having a criminal history is a strong indicator of higher risk for recidivism. Even one conviction can lead to future offenses due to learned behavior or lack of effective rehabilitation. So that's definitely high.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 130 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics alone contribute much to recidivism, so this is probably low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she lacks the supervision or support that a family environment could provide. This could increase her risk because she doesn't have someone monitoring her behavior. So, medium.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant factor. Those without diplomas often struggle more to find stable employment and may engage in criminal activities out of necessity or poor decision-making. This is definitely high risk.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs in the year. Having steady employment can reduce the likelihood of recidivism by providing structure and financial stability. So, more jobs mean lower risk. That's medium.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator, but frequent or recent use can increase the risk of criminal behavior. She also mentioned feeling down in the dumps recently, which could be linked to substance abuse. So, high risk here.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of three as a young child. Growing up in a larger family might provide more supervision and support, which could buffer against delinquent behaviors. But since she's now living alone, maybe the influence is less. Still, having that family structure as a child could be protective, so low risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God or religion. Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can deter criminal behavior by instilling values and accountability. Without such beliefs, there might be fewer inhibitions, so this is medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: age (high), criminal history (high), education (high), employment (medium), drug use (high), family structure (low), religion (medium). The high factors are age, criminal history, and drug use. The medium ones are employment, religion, and family. Low is only family.\n\nSo the prediction would lean towards YES because of the high factors outweighing the others. Confidence is about 70% because while there's a strong case for recidivism, some factors like stable employment might mitigate it somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Youthful age increases risk due to lack of life experience and higher impulsivity\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Racial disparities in recidivism rates may influence risk, though impact is less direct here\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Conviction indicates existing behavior that could repeat\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone reduces supervision, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits employment opportunities and decision-making\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Stable job provides structure reducing criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use increases likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Family size may offer some protection, though current situation is alone\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief may reduce internal accountability mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
