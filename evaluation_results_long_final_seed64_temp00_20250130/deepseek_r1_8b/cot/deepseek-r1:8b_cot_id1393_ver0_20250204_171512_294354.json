    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 20-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of being rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's a young woman, 20 years old, which is a common age for first-time offenses or situations where she might be more impulsive. Being Black could mean she faces different societal and systemic challenges that White individuals might not, which can influence her chances of reoffending.\n\nShe has a history of drug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years. That's concerning because substance abuse is a known predictor of criminal behavior. Plus, she mentioned feeling down recently, which could indicate emotional instability or stressors that might lead to further issues.\n\nHer living situation growing up was in an urban area with a household of three, including her biological mother. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences. Being part of a larger family might mean she had more opportunities for negative influences or modeling behavior from others.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone now. Living alone can be both a protective factor if it means she has more independence, but it can also be risky if she lacks support systems or supervision. It might contribute to higher risk if she doesn't have someone to check in on her or provide guidance.\n\nHaving held four jobs in the past year suggests she's motivated and responsible, which are positive signs. Employment can be a stabilizing factor that reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior. However, if she lost her job recently, that stress could contribute to recidivism.\n\nHer education level is a high school diploma, which is good, but not enrolled in college. Higher education is linked to lower crime rates, so not being in college might increase her risk compared to someone with further education.\n\nShe considers God's influence on her life, which could be a form of social support or a source of moral guidance. Religiosity can sometimes deter from criminal behavior, but if it's weak, it might not provide enough protection against recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: her age, race, drug history, living situation, independence, employment, education, and religious beliefs. The most significant factors seem to be her recent emotional state and past substance abuse. These are strong indicators that she might be at a higher risk of rearrest.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact weights, but I think substance abuse is a high factor because it's directly linked to criminal behavior. Emotional distress could also be high since it can lead to impulsive actions. Living in an urban area and having been part of a larger household might each be medium factors, as they contribute to systemic issues but aren't as direct as the others.\n\nEmployment is positive, so that would be low. Education level is also low because not having college enrollment could increase risk, but it's not as impactful as substance abuse or emotional state. Her race and being alone are moderate factors, with race affecting systemic issues and living alone indicating some independence but without support.\n\nPutting this together, I think the prediction leans towards \"YES\" she will be rearrest within three years, with a high confidence level because of her substance use and current emotional struggles.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 20, which is a common age for first-time offenses or impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Being Black may face systemic challenges that could increase criminal involvement\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"History of marijuana use and current emotional distress are strong predictors\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone can be protective if it indicates independence, though without support it might be risky\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Four jobs held suggests responsibility and motivation, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is positive but not as impactful as other factors\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence can provide moral guidance but might be weak\"),\n    (\"urban_area\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose to higher crime rates and influences\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
