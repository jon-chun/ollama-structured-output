    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's White, 5'8\", weighs between 150-174 lbs. He's single and living alone now. Being an adult and living independently might indicate some level of maturity or responsibility, which could be a protective factor. But since he's been arrested before, maybe that's a red flag.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is positive because education can reduce the risk of recidivism. He held one job last year, which also suggests he has some structure in his life, another protective factor.\n\nHis substance use: he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent use could increase the likelihood of further arrests, especially if he continues using. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate he's not currently using heavily or experiencing the typical triggers for recidivism related to mental health.\n\nHe grew up in a household with both biological parents in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, so that's a risk factor. Also, living with both parents might provide some level of supervision or support, but since he's been arrested, maybe the family environment wasn't as supportive.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That could be a protective factor if it gives him a sense of purpose or control over his life, potentially reducing criminal behavior. Alternatively, it might not directly impact recidivism much either way.\n\nArrest history: two arrests but no convictions. This suggests he's at risk because he's been involved with the criminal justice system before, which is a known predictor of future rearrests. However, since there are no convictions, maybe he hasn't been as deeply entrenched in the criminal world yet.\n\nHe's 18, which is a young age. Youth is generally a lower risk period for recidivism compared to adulthood or older ages, but his past arrests might indicate higher risk.\n\nPutting it all together: He has some protective factors like current school enrollment and employment, but also some risks like substance use and living in an urban area. His belief system could be either protective or neutral. His arrest history is a significant risk factor, especially since he's been arrested multiple times without conviction, which might indicate higher likelihood of future rearrests.\n\nI think the key factors here are his arrest history (high), substance use (medium), living in an urban area (medium), and possibly his belief system (low or medium). His school enrollment and employment could mitigate some of these risks, so they should be considered as protective factors with high weights.\n\nSo, assigning weights: Arrest history is definitely a high risk. Substance use is also high because it's directly linked to recidivism. Urban area is medium because while it's a risk, its impact might not be as severe as the other factors. His belief system could be low or medium; I'm leaning towards medium since it might provide some structure but not as strong as others.\n\nHis age is 18, which is a protective factor, so that should be low. His current school and job are also protective, so those get low weights too. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently could be another protective factor, maybe low or medium.\n\nWait, I think I might have missed some factors. Let me list them out again:\n\n1. Age: 18 - Protective (low)\n2. Arrest history: High\n3. Substance use: High\n4. Urban upbringing: Medium\n5. School enrollment: Protective (low)\n6. Employment: Protective (low)\n7. Belief in God: Could be protective, maybe medium.\n8. Depression status: No depression recently - Protective (low)\n\nSo, the factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: High\n- Substance use: High\n- Urban area: Medium\n- School/Work: Low\n- Belief: Medium\n- Age: Low\n- Depression: Low\n\nNow, considering all these together, the prediction would lean towards \"YES\" because the high risk factors outweigh the protective ones. Confidence is probably around 70% since there are significant risks but also some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"school_enrollment\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"depression_status\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
