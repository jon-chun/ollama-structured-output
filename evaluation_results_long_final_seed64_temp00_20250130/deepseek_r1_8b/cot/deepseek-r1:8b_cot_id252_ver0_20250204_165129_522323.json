    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old male who's been arrested three times and convicted. He's Asian/Pacific Islander, 5'7\", 230 lbs, married but living alone. No high school diploma or GED, not in college. Held two jobs this year. No drug use in the past four years, but he's felt down lately. At a young age, he was in a household of 11. Believes God has something to do with his personal life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out each factor and assign a weight based on how it might influence rearrest risk.\n\n1. **Age**: He's 20, which is relatively young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills. So, this is probably a high risk factor.\n\n2. **Gender**: Male. Men are generally more likely to reoffend than women, so that's another high.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Asian/Pacific Islander. Some studies show higher recidivism rates among certain ethnic groups, but I'm not sure about this specific group. Maybe medium.\n\n4. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: 230 lbs at 5'7\". That's significantly overweight. Higher BMI can be linked to higher risk factors, so high.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: Married but living alone. Being married might reduce risk, but living alone could mean more time for criminal activities. Maybe medium.\n\n6. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED and not in college. Lower education levels are strongly linked to higher recidivism rates. High.\n\n7. **Employment**: Held two jobs this year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, so low.\n\n8. **Drug Use**: No drug use in the past four years. Clean from drugs is good, but he felt down recently. Maybe medium.\n\n9. **Mental Health**: Felt down recently. Depression or similar issues can increase risk. High.\n\n10. **Household Size at Young Age**: Lived in a household of 11. Larger families might have different influences, but I'm not sure how this affects recidivism. Maybe low.\n\n11. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God has something to do with his life. Religion can be protective or risk-increasing depending on context. Maybe medium.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the highest risks are age, gender, BMI, education, and mental health. These likely outweigh other factors. So, prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates due to developing decision-making skills\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Men are more likely to reoffend than women\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Some ethnic groups may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"BMI\", \"high\", \"Higher BMI is linked to increased risk factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Married but living alone might increase risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lower education levels correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Clean from drugs is positive, recent unhappiness may affect\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Mental health issues like depression increase risk\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Larger households' influence on recidivism unclear\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective or risky\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
