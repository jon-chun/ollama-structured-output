    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person who's a 22-year-old male. He identifies as Black, which might be relevant because of racial disparities in the criminal justice system. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which could mean he's at higher risk since arrest is often a precursor to further involvement.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 185 lbs, so he's of average build, maybe not particularly imposing or small, which might affect how authorities perceive him. Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests he has limited education, which can be a risk factor for recidivism because education is a protective factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year, so he's currently unemployed. Unemployment can lead to financial stress, which might contribute to criminal behavior. He's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and feels down sometimes, indicating possible substance abuse issues that could increase his risk of rearrest.\n\nHe was raised by adults other than biological parents in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in a non-traditional household might have exposed him to environments that normalize criminal behavior or reduce the stigma of it. Also, being in an urban area often correlates with higher crime rates and limited access to resources.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with his life personally, which could mean he lacks a support system or moral framework that might otherwise deter him from criminal activity. This lack of spiritual or social connections can increase risk.\n\nLooking at each factor:\n\n1. **Race**: Black individuals are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, so this is likely a high risk factor.\n2. **Arrest History**: One arrest but no conviction\u2014still, a history of arrest is a significant predictor.\n3. **Employment Status**: Unemployed increases risk due to economic stress.\n4. **Education Level**: No diploma or GED is a medium-high risk.\n5. **Drug Use**: Current use of marijuana and cocaine is high risk.\n6. **Household Structure**: Growing up in a non-traditional household is medium-high.\n7. **Urban Residence**: Urban areas have higher crime rates, so this is high.\n8. **Lack of Faith**: No belief in God might mean less deterrence, so high risk.\n\nCombining these, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" he will be rearrest within three years. Confidence is around 75% because while several factors are strong, some like arrest without conviction and lack of faith are significant but others like education and employment could mitigate if there were more positive factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals are overrepresented in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without a conviction increases risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployed may face economic stress leading to crime\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium_high\", \"No diploma/GED is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Current use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant factor\"),\n    (\"household_structure\", \"medium_high\", \"Non-traditional upbringing may normalize crime\"),\n    (\"urban_area\", \"high\", \"Urban areas have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"lack_of_faith\", \"high\", \"No belief in God may reduce deterrence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
