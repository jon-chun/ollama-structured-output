    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested twice and convicted. Let me start by going through each part of his background.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male, which is often a significant factor in criminal justice systems due to systemic issues. I think that's a high risk factor because of the higher likelihood of being overpoliced or having harsher sentences.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted, so he has a criminal history. That definitely points towards a higher risk of recidivism. People with prior convictions are more likely to reoffend if not given proper intervention.\n\nHis weight is between 200-224 lbs, which is on the heavier side for someone his age. I'm not sure how much that directly affects criminal behavior, but being overweight can sometimes be linked to stress or other issues that might contribute to recidivism. Maybe medium risk there.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean he lacks supervision or support, which might increase his chances of getting into trouble again. That seems like a medium factor because without stable living conditions, it's harder to stay on track.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a big red flag for future opportunities and potential criminal behavior. This is probably a high risk factor because education is linked to lower recidivism rates.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs in the year, which shows some responsibility. That's a positive sign, so maybe that's a low risk factor. Employment can provide structure and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Recent drug use could be a medium risk because it indicates ongoing substance issues, which are linked to criminal behavior. However, not feeling depressed might lower the risk compared to someone experiencing more severe mental health issues.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can have negative influences like exposure to crime and lack of resources. That's likely a medium factor because it contributes to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be protective against criminal behavior, so that might be a low risk factor. Faith-based beliefs often correlate with lower recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the highest risks are his race, criminal history, lack of education, and living situation. The lowest is his employment and religious beliefs. So, I'd assign high to race, criminal history, education, and living situation; medium to age, drug use, and family background; and low to employment and religiosity.\n\nNow, for the prediction: given these factors, it's more likely he'll be rearrested within three years. Confidence is around 70% because while several high-risk factors are present, some like employment and recent mental state might mitigate it a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Black male; higher likelihood of overpolicing and harsher sentences\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Arrested twice and convicted; prior convictions increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Overweight; potential stress or health issues contributing to behavior\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone at 18; lack of supervision may lead to trouble\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma; education linked to lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held 3 jobs; shows responsibility and structure\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana recently; substance issues linked to crime\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not depressed recently; better mental state than severe cases\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with single parent; negative influences\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Believes in God's influence; faith can protect against crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
