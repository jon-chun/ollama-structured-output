    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 19-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of being rearrested in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's a young woman, 19, which is pretty early in life for criminal behavior. I know that younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might make poor decisions. So age could be a medium factor here.\n\nShe identifies as Black. I remember reading that racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, with minorities often facing harsher sentences and more arrests. Being Black might increase her risk, so that's probably a high factor.\n\nShe has a history of being arrested once but not convicted. That single arrest suggests she's been involved in some illegal activity, which could indicate higher likelihood of future issues. So that's another medium factor.\n\nHer physical description: 5'6\" and 160 lbs. I'm not sure how much body weight affects criminal behavior, but maybe if she's under or over a certain weight, it might influence her decisions. Not sure, so maybe low here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the same level of supervision or support that someone in a family setting might have. That could be medium because without that structure, she might be more prone to risky behaviors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not having further education might limit her opportunities and increase stress, which can lead to criminal behavior. So that's probably medium.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it can lead to financial stress or boredom, which might push someone towards illegal activities. That seems like a medium factor as well.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive. If she's clean now, that reduces her immediate risk compared to active users. So that's low.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues are linked to higher recidivism, but since she's not currently experiencing depression, it might be a lower factor unless there's a history we don't know about.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a single-parent household, especially in an urban environment, can expose her to more stressors and possibly higher crime rates. That's medium because urban areas often have more crime opportunities.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God or the divine's role in her life. Religiosity can influence behavior; without it, she might lack a moral framework or support system that could deter criminal behavior. So that's another medium factor.\n\nPutting this all together, I think each of these factors contributes to some extent, but none are extremely high. The prediction is a bit on the edge, so maybe 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may contribute to higher recidivism rates due to immaturity and decision-making\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Racial disparities in criminal justice system involvement\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest suggests potential for future behavior\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"Limited impact on criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack supervision and support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without further education may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to stress and boredom\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces immediate risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Currently no depression, but history unknown\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with single parent may expose to stressors\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief may lack moral framework\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
