Let me start by going through each piece of information given.\n\nFirst, she's mixed race, which might relate to systemic issues or discrimination in the justice system, but I'm not sure how significant that is on its own. Maybe it's a medium factor because it could influence treatment or sentencing disparities.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and between 150-174 lbs. That's average weight for her height, so maybe that doesn't contribute much to risk factors. Probably low.\n\nShe hasn't been married and lives alone now. Being alone might mean she has fewer supports, which could increase risks. Maybe medium because it relates to social support and supervision.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not being enrolled in college could indicate lower educational attainment, which is linked to higher recidivism. So that's probably a medium factor.\n\nShe hasn't held a job this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it may lead to financial stress or difficulty finding constructive activities, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior. That seems like a medium factor too.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator for recidivism. High risk here because substance abuse often correlates with reoffending.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate she's managing her mental health or stress effectively. If she was feeling depressed before, it could be a higher risk factor, but since she's not now, maybe low.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with adoptive parents in a rural area. Growing up in a large household might provide more supervision or role models, which could reduce risk factors. So that's probably a low factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God having anything to do with her life personally. Religiosity can influence behavior and rehabilitation. If she lacks spiritual support, maybe higher risk because she might not seek help from religious or community-based programs.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use is high, criminal history is significant, lack of education and employment are medium, living alone is medium, mixed race is medium due to systemic issues, and lack of belief in God is medium as it removes a potential support. The prediction would lean towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"mixed_race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic issues and potential disparities in justice system\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average weight for height, no direct correlation to risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Not enrolled in college linked to higher recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial stress and criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Currently not feeling depressed may indicate effective management\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Large household in rural area may provide supervision\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief may reduce access to support programs\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
