Let me start by going through each part of his background.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, which might be relevant because some studies show demographic differences in recidivism. But I'm not sure if it's high or low. Maybe medium since there could be both positive and negative stereotypes.\n\nHe has three arrests and convictions, so that's definitely a high risk factor. A history of criminal behavior is a strong indicator for future rearrests.\n\nHis height and weight are average, but I don't think physical stats alone contribute much to recidivism risk. Maybe low or medium.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he doesn't have the support system that could help him stay out of trouble. That could be a medium factor.\n\nNo high school diploma and not in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher crime rates, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to financial stress, which might increase recidivism. So that's another high factor.\n\nHe has used drugs recently\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and felt down in the past month. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. High priority here.\n\nHe grew up in a large household in a rural area. Big family might provide more support or maybe less supervision, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism. Maybe medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God. Religiosity can influence behavior; without it, he might have fewer inhibitions. That could be a high risk factor.\n\nPutting this all together: arrests/convictions (high), drug use (high), unemployment (high), no education (high). The other factors like demographics and living situation are medium or low. So the prediction is likely \"YES\" with high confidence, maybe around 85.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"White male demographic factors\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Arrests and convictions history\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without family support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or college enrollment\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployed with no job experience\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use history\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up in a large household but in rural area\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"high\", \"Lack of religious beliefs\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in a rural area.
