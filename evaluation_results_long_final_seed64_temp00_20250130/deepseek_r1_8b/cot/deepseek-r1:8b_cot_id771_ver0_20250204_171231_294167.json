    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this person and predict if they'll be rearrested in three years. Let me start by going through each piece of information given.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age is important because younger people might have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals who've had more time to settle down or change their behavior. So I think that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted. A history of arrests and convictions directly correlates with future rearrests, so this should be high. People with a criminal history are more likely to reoffend because they've already adapted to a life that includes crime.\n\nHis height is 5'11\" and weight 160 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stats play into recidivism, but maybe being taller or heavier could affect things like job opportunities or social interactions, which might indirectly impact criminal behavior. Maybe this is low or medium.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might provide more structure or supervision, reducing the risk of recidivism compared to living alone. So not living alone could be a protective factor, maybe low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be both a protective and a risk factor. Higher education often correlates with lower crime rates, so not being in college might increase risk, but having a diploma is positive. I'm leaning towards medium here because without further education, he might struggle more.\n\nHe's held one job this year. Employment is a strong protective factor. People with stable jobs are less likely to reoffend because they have a routine and responsibilities. So this should be low or medium. One job isn't a lot, but it shows some stability.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Not using drugs is great because substance abuse is a major contributor to crime. Feeling depressed could either increase or decrease risk, depending on the context. If he's not currently depressed, that's positive, so maybe low.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two. Growing up in a two-parent household is generally protective against delinquency. So this factor should be low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God affects his life personally. Religiosity can be a protective factor because it provides moral support and social ties. Without strong religious beliefs, he might lack these supports, so this could increase risk. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together: age is medium, criminal history high, employment low, education medium, living situation low, substance use low, mental health low, family background low, and religiosity medium.\n\nSo the prediction would be \"YES\" with a confidence around 70% because while there are several protective factors like employment and not using drugs, his criminal history is significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"History of arrests and convictions directly correlates with future rearrests\"),\n    (\"physical_stats\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics may influence social and employment opportunities\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide more supervision and structure\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is positive, but lack of college education increases risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"One job shows stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a two-parent household is protective\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God may increase recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
