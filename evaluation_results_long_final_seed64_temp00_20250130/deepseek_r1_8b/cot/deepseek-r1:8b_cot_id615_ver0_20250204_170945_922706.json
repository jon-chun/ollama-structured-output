    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who has been arrested twice and convicted. He's White, 6'0\", 165 lbs, never married, living alone. He has a GED and is not in college, held one job last year. He used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. He grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. He doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, I should consider each factor's weight. Let me list them out:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: He has two arrests and convictions. That's a point in favor of higher risk because prior criminal history is a strong predictor of recidivism.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a direct indicator, but combined with other factors like criminal history, it can increase risk.\n\n3. **Employment Status**: He held one job last year. Stable employment can reduce risk by providing structure, so this might be a lower factor.\n\n4. **Living Situation**: Growing up in an urban area with both parents (household of four) could provide better support, which might lower recidivism risk compared to other backgrounds.\n\n5. **Religious Beliefs**: He doesn't believe in God. Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can influence behavior, so this might increase the risk slightly.\n\n6. **Age and Gender**: 21-year-old male. Younger age is typically higher risk for recidivism, but it's a bit offset by other factors like employment.\n\n7. **Marital Status**: Never married, living alone. Living alone without a partner can be a risk factor as it might reduce social support.\n\n8. **Education Level**: GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels are often linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\n9. **Depression**: He hasn't felt depressed recently. Depression is sometimes a contributing factor for criminal behavior, so this could lower the risk.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- **Arrest History (High)**: Strong predictor.\n- **Drug Use (Medium)**: Combined with arrest history, it's significant but not alone.\n- **Employment (Low)**: Positive factor reducing risk.\n- **Living Situation (Medium)**: Urban background might increase risk compared to rural areas.\n- **Religious Beliefs (Medium)**: Lack of belief could contribute.\n- **Age and Gender (High)**: Young male is a high-risk demographic.\n- **Marital Status (Medium)**: Living alone can be risky.\n- **Education Level (Medium)**: Lower education increases risk.\n- **Depression (Low)**: Recent lack of depression might help.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors lean towards higher risk. The prediction would be \"YES\" with high confidence around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Prior criminal history significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Substance abuse is a known contributor to recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Stable employment can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living\u60c5\u51b5\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and family background may increase risk\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious belief can contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"age_gender\", \"high\", \"Young males are a high-risk demographic for recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a partner increases risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lower education levels correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Recent lack of depression may reduce risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
