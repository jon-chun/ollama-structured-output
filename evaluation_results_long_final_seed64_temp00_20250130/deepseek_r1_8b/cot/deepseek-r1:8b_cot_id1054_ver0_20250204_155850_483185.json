    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: Hispanic, 5'11\", 150-174 lbs. He's never married and lives with someone else. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college. He held one job last year. No drug use in the past four years but felt down recently. He grew up in an urban area with both parents, so that's a stable upbringing. He doesn't believe in God.\n\nI should consider each factor's weight. Age is 18, which is young and might be more impulsive. Hispanic ethnicity can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates. His criminal history is minimal\u2014only one arrest without a conviction, so maybe low risk there.\n\nEmployment: he held one job, which is positive, so that's probably a good factor reducing risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years suggests lower risk of substance-related offenses, but he felt down recently. Depression could be a risk factor for criminal behavior, so that might be medium.\n\nFamily structure was stable with both parents, which usually reduces risk compared to chaotic households.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might indicate lower reliance on external moral frameworks, possibly increasing risk as internal controls are weaker.\n\nPutting it all together: Age is high risk, ethnicity medium, criminal history low, employment good (low), substance use low, family stable (low), religion non-belief (high). So factors like age and non-belief in God might increase the risk. The prediction would lean towards YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Young age may increase risk of impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Hispanic ethnicity may correlate with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No convictions despite one arrest\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: One job held indicates stability\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No drug use in past four years\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Stable upbringing with both parents\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Non-belief may reduce internal moral constraints\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
