Let me break down each part of her history and see how it might contribute to her likelihood of rearrest in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she's 18, which is pretty young. Younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing decision-making skills and might be more impulsive. That could be a high risk factor right there.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race alone is a significant factor in recidivism, but it can sometimes influence outcomes in the criminal justice system, so maybe that's medium.\n\nShe has a GED, which is good because education can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. So that might be low or medium. I think having some education is better than none, so maybe medium.\n\nShe's living alone now, but she hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it can lead to financial stress or boredom, which might contribute to criminal activity. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe has used drugs recently\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't always a crime, but if she's been using, there's a higher chance she could get rearrested for new offenses or because of drug-related issues. So that's definitely high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is interesting. Sometimes, mental health issues like depression can lead to criminal behavior, so not feeling depressed might lower that risk a bit. Maybe low.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a household of four. A stable family environment can be protective against delinquency, so that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. That could mean she has strong religious beliefs which might influence her behavior positively or negatively. It might give her a sense of purpose, reducing crime, but it could also lead to more strict moral codes. I'm not sure, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting this all together: age is high, race is medium, education is medium, unemployment is high, drug use is high, mental health is low, family support is low, and religious beliefs are medium.\n\nSo the prediction would lean towards \"YES\" she'll be rearrested. Confidence-wise, considering several high factors like age, unemployment, and drug use, I'd say around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Youthful age is a significant risk factor for recidivism as younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"While race itself may not directly correlate with recidivism, systemic biases can influence outcomes in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is a positive factor that can reduce recidivism risks compared to having no formal education\"),\n    (\"unemployment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial stress and boredom, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use increases the risk of rearrest due to potential new offenses or drug-related issues\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed may indicate better mental health, which can reduce recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"low\", \"A stable family environment with both biological parents is protective against delinquency\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Strong religious beliefs can influence behavior positively or negatively, potentially reducing crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
