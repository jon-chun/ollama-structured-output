    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested 10 times and convicted. He's living alone, hasn't held a job in a year, uses marijuana, and considers God's influence on his life. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is relatively young. Younger individuals typically have higher recidivism rates because they might lack the impulse control or opportunities that come with maturity. So I think Age would be a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. Racial factors can influence outcomes in the criminal justice system, but it's complex. Some studies show higher rates of rearrest among certain racial groups, so maybe this is medium to high.\n\nHe has 10 arrests and convictions, which suggests a pattern of behavior. A history of arrests is a strong indicator of future recidivism, so that's definitely high.\n\nUnstable living conditions: he lives alone, hasn't held a job in a year. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, and unemployment can lead to financial stress, increasing criminal opportunities. That seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use is another key point. He has used marijuana recently, which is associated with higher recidivism. So that's high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so mental health isn't an immediate concern here. If he were showing signs of depression or instability, that would be a different factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: he considers God's influence on his life. Some studies suggest religious involvement can reduce recidivism, but it varies. It might lower risk, so maybe low.\n\nHe has no educational background beyond high school and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is linked to higher crime rates, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nUnemployment for a year indicates he's not currently employed, which can contribute to criminal behavior due to financial strain or boredom. That's another medium.\n\nPutting it all together: Age (high), Race (medium-high?), Arrest history (high), Employment (medium), Education (medium), Drug use (high), Living alone (medium). I think each of these contributes, but some might have more weight than others. Maybe assign high to the most impactful ones like arrest history and drug use.\n\nSo, factors would be:\n\n- Age: High\n- Race: Medium\n- Arrest History: High\n- Employment: Medium\n- Education: Medium\n- Drug Use: High\n- Living Alone: Medium\n- Religion: Low\n\nPrediction is likely \"YES\" he'll be rearrested. Confidence around 85 because of the strong factors like arrest history and drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates due to lack of impulse control and opportunities\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Racial factors can influence outcomes in the criminal justice system, with certain groups having higher rearrest rates\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"A history of 10 arrests indicates a pattern of behavior linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial stress and increased criminal opportunities\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education is associated with higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision and increase exposure to criminal influences\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can sometimes reduce recidivism, though impact varies\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
