    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old male who has been arrested twice and convicted. He's White, 6'2\", 275 lbs, married, living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college. He's held two jobs this year. He's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. He grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of five. He believes God plays a role in his personal life.\n\nFirst, I should consider each factor one by one. Age is 20, which is relatively young, so that's probably a medium risk because younger people might have more opportunities for crime but also more chances for change. Criminal history: he's been arrested twice and convicted, so that's two prior convictions. That suggests higher risk, maybe high.\n\nRace: White males are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, so that's another high factor. Employment: he's held two jobs, which is positive, indicating he has a stable income source, reducing the likelihood of crime. So that's low.\n\nMarital status: Being married and living with his spouse can be protective, so that's low. Education: He has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not being enrolled might indicate lower educational engagement, which could increase risk, maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism, so that's high. Depression: He hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good because depression can lead to criminal behavior, so low.\n\nFamily background: Growing up in an urban household with both parents might provide some social support or influence, but it's mixed. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, so maybe medium. Religious beliefs: Believing God has a role in his life could be protective, suggesting he has a value system, so that's low.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors are:\n\n- Age: Medium\n- Criminal history: High\n- Race: High\n- Employment: Low\n- Marital status: Low\n- Education: Medium\n- Drug use: High\n- Depression: Low\n- Family background: Medium\n- Religious beliefs: Low\n\nNow, weighting them. High factors are criminal history and drug use, each worth 3 points. Race is also high, another 3. Medium factors are age (2), education (2), family background (2). Low factors are employment (1), marital status (1), depression (1), religious beliefs (1).\n\nTotal: 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 +1+1+1+1 = 18 points. The threshold is usually around 15, so this would predict a \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
