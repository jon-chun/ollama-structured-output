    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male who's been arrested three times and convicted. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, which might be relevant in terms of demographic factors. I know that being White can sometimes correlate with different arrest rates, but I'm not sure if it's a significant factor here. Maybe it's medium because it could influence sentencing or police interactions.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and 215 lbs. That's on the heavier side for someone his age. Body weight can affect physical health, which might lead to substance abuse issues or other problems that increase arrest risk. I think this is a high factor because being overweight can contribute to higher recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 could mean he lacks supervision or support, which might increase his chances of getting into trouble. This seems like a medium factor since it relates to social support, which is important for preventing criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not being enrolled in college might indicate lower educational attainment, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. This could be a medium risk because education is a protective factor against crime.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Employment can provide structure and financial stability, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, having steady employment is a positive sign, making this a low factor.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down in the dumps recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor. The recent downturn might indicate stress or emotional issues that could lead to further problems. This is definitely a high factor because substance abuse and emotional instability are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nHe grew up in a household of seven, which is a large family size. Big families can provide more support, but they might also have higher rates of crime due to overcrowding or lack of resources. I'm not sure how this plays in, so maybe it's medium because it could either help or hinder depending on the situation.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor against criminal behavior by promoting values and social connections. This is a low factor since it suggests he has some positive influences or beliefs that might reduce his risk.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the highest risks are drug use and being overweight. The job and religiosity are positives, but the lack of education and living alone could also contribute. So, I'm leaning towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"White male demographic factors\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"high\", \"Overweight status contributing to health issues\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but no college enrollment\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Steady employment providing stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and emotional distress\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Large household potentially affecting support\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide protective factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
