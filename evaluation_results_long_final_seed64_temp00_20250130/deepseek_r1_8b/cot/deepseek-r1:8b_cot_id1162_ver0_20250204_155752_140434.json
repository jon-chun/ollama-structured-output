    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her demographic: she's Hispanic, 5'5\", weighs between 125-149 lbs. Not sure how much weight plays into criminal risk, but maybe being in that range is average, so probably low impact.\n\nShe hasn't been married and isn't living alone. She has a high school diploma, not enrolled in college. Having a job might indicate some stability, but she's only held one job this year. Maybe that's a positive sign, so lower risk there.\n\nDrug use: she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recurrent drug use can be a significant factor for recidivism, so I'd rate that as high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate she's not dealing with some issues that could lead to further problems. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: she doesn't believe in God. I'm not sure how that affects behavior, but maybe without religious ties, there's less structure, so that could be medium risk.\n\nShe was raised in an urban area by non-biological parents in a household of four. Growing up in a big, possibly chaotic household might contribute to higher risk factors, so that's high.\n\nHer criminal history is just one arrest without a conviction. That's low since she hasn't been convicted before.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use and upbringing are high risks. The rest seem lower. So overall prediction leans towards YES with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"low\", \"Her age, gender, height, weight, marital status, living situation, education level, and employment status do not significantly contribute to criminal risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"She has no prior convictions, indicating a lower likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recurrent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant factor associated with higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"She reports not feeling depressed in the past month, which may indicate better mental health and lower risk of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Her lack of religious beliefs might contribute to a less structured life, increasing criminal risk\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"high\", \"Growing up in an urban area with non-biological parents may expose her to higher levels of environmental risk factors\"),\n    (\"job_stability\", \"low\", \"Having held one job suggests some stability, which may reduce criminal risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.
