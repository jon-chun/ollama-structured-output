    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each part of his background step by step.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's Black, 5'8\", 145 lbs. He hasn't married yet and is living alone. He has a high school diploma and isn't in college. He held one job last year, which might indicate some stability but not a lot. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that's positive. However, he feels really down most of the time, which could be a red flag for mental health or emotional instability.\n\nLooking at his upbringing, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area along with two others. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences. He also mentions that he believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes, which might influence his decision-making or coping mechanisms.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted, so maybe he was charged but not found guilty or the case is pending. That could mean he's at higher risk if there's a pattern of non-conviction but continued behavior that leads to arrests.\n\nHis education level is high school diploma, which is good, but not being in college might indicate lower educational attainment, possibly leading to fewer opportunities and higher stress levels.\n\nHe held one job, so he has some work experience. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but only one job might not provide enough structure or income stability.\n\nHis mental state seems concerning because feeling consistently down could lead to issues like depression or anxiety, which are risk factors for recidivism. He hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive, but his current emotional state might be a new issue.\n\nConsidering all these factors: race (Black males often have higher rates of arrest), no prior convictions but an arrest record, possible mental health issues, living situation in an urban area, and some work history. He's young, so recidivism risk might be medium to high depending on how these factors interact.\n\nI think the key factors here are his current emotional state (high risk), race (medium), no prior convictions but one arrest (maybe medium), living in an urban area (medium), and having a job (low). His belief system could also play a role, possibly increasing his risk if he's using it as a coping mechanism.\n\nSo, assigning weights: emotional state is high because it directly relates to mental health. Race is medium due to statistical correlations. Arrest history is medium since there's one but no conviction. Urban environment is medium as urban areas often have higher crime rates. Employment is low because having a job can reduce recidivism. Belief system might be medium if it's influencing his behavior.\n\nPutting this together, the prediction would lean towards \"YES\" with high confidence, maybe around 75% or so.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"current_emotional_state\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_environment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion_or_belief\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
