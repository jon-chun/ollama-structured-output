    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger people, especially those in their early twenties, are more likely to reoffend because they might have less experience with stable living or employment. So this seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. From what I've read, racial factors can influence recidivism rates, but it's complicated because of systemic issues. However, being part of a marginalized group does increase the likelihood of reoffending, so I'll consider this medium to high. Maybe medium since it's not just about race but also other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. A history of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator. Each prior arrest increases the chance of future ones, so this should be high.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 165 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stats directly affect recidivism, but being average doesn't necessarily mean low risk. Maybe medium.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be both good and bad. Without a support system, it might lead to higher risk, so maybe medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a big red flag for future crimes because it limits employment and life skills. This should definitely be high.\n\nHe's held one job this year. Employment can provide structure, so having only one job might not be enough to lower risk much. Maybe medium.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use is a significant factor. Recent use and feeling down could indicate higher risk, especially if he's using now and maybe struggling with mental health. So high.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a large urban household. Growing up in a big family might have provided some support or chaos. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, so this adds to the risk. Maybe medium.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. Religiosity can influence behavior, but it's not clear if it's protective or not. It could be either, so maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together: age is high, race medium-high, arrests high, physical stats medium, living situation medium, education high, employment medium, drug use high, family background medium, and religiosity low.\n\nSo the prediction would lean towards YES with high confidence because several high factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"physical_stats\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
