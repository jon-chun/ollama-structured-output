He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
