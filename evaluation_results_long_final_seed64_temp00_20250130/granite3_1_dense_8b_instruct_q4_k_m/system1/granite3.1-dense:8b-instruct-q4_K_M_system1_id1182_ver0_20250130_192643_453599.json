While the individual has a history of arrests and convictions, the number is not extremely high. His age (21) suggests he may be at a developmental stage where risky behaviors are more common. His employment history shows some stability with 2 jobs held during the year. He does not report feeling depressed recently, which can be a positive indicator. The absence of recent drug use and lack of marital status or family responsibilities also suggest less risk. However, living in an urban area and having a history of drug use could potentially indicate higher risk. Overall, given the information provided, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 60%.",
