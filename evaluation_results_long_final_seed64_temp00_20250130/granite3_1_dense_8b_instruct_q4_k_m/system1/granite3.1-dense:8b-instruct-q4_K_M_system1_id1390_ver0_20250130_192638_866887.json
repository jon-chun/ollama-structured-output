While the individual has a history of arrests and convictions, he has not engaged in drug use or experienced depression recently. He also does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, which could potentially impact his employment opportunities and overall life stability. However, the absence of recent criminal activity, substance abuse, and mental health issues, along with his stable living situation, contribute to a lower risk assessment compared to individuals with these factors present. The age, gender, ethnicity, and family background do not significantly influence the risk level in this case.",
