The individual is young, has no prior convictions, and has not used drugs in the past four years. She is married and living with her spouse, which can be a protective factor against criminal behavior. Her educational attainment (high school diploma) and employment history (holding 2 jobs during the year) also suggest stability. However, the fact that she has felt persistently sad for a month could potentially indicate mental health issues, which might increase risk if left untreated. The urban upbringing in a large family could be a factor depending on the specifics of her environment and family dynamics. Overall, while there are some potential risk factors, they are not severe enough to predict high risk based on the information provided.",
