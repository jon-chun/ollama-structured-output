The individual's age (20), gender, and ethnicity do not inherently suggest high risk. His criminal history is limited to one arrest and conviction, which is also indicative of lower risk. His physical attributes are average. He has never been married and lives alone, which does not significantly impact his risk level. His educational background (high school diploma) and employment history (holding 3 jobs in a year) suggest stability and adaptability. He has no recent drug use and has experienced prolonged periods of depression, but this factor is balanced by his lack of substance abuse issues. His upbringing in a rural area with adults other than biological parents does not significantly increase risk. Lastly, his religious beliefs do not typically correlate with high criminal recidivism rates. However, the confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information provided and the complexity of predicting human behavior.",

He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
