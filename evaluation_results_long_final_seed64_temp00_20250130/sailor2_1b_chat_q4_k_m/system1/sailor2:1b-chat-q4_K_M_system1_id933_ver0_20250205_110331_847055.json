This aligns with a high risk profile.\n- **Background Information**: His background includes being White, living alone, not having a high school diploma/GED, and holding one job, which suggests stability but does not indicate severe financial or employment instability.\n- **Marital Status and Family Dynamics**: He is single and has no family members who might be at risk. The lack of social support networks indicates minimal risk.\n- **Employment History**: No criminal record, no drug use in the past four years, and a stable job status suggest he does not pose immediate risks from employment-related issues.\n- **Family Background**: Living with both biological parents suggests a strong familial bond but does not indicate significant family instability or financial strain.\n- **Personal Beliefs and Religious Affiliation**: He identifies himself as White and has no religious beliefs that might be associated with high-risk behaviors, indicating minimal spiritual risk.\n\nAll these factors contribute to a high probability of low-to-moderate risk. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 90%.",
