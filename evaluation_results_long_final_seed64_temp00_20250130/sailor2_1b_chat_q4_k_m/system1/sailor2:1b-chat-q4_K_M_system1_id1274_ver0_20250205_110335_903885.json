His physical attributes are typical for his age group.\n- **Arrest History and Conviction**: Arrested twice but not convicted, suggesting a stable criminal record.\n- **Occupations and Income**: 4 jobs in the past year, consistent income level (202 lbs), and holding a high school diploma indicate stability and potential employment.\n- **Drug Use**: Past four years of marijuana use without depression, indicating a controlled substance use pattern.\n- **Family Background**: Living with an adoptive parent(s) in a large household (5 people) suggests familial support but does not imply isolation or lack of social interaction.\n- **Cultural Identity and Personal Beliefs**: His Hispanic identity and cultural background suggest a strong personal connection to God, which could be a significant factor influencing his life choices.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is that he has a high risk due to his stable criminal record, drug use history, and potential religious beliefs. Therefore, **YES** indicates high risk.\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
