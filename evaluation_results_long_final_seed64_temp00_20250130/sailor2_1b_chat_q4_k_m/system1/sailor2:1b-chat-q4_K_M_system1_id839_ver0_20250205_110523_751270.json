His physical measurements are within the normal range for his age.\n- **Background Information**: He has no criminal history, no employment, and uses drugs regularly, indicating substance abuse issues.\n- **Family Background**: Living with biological mother in a rural area without college education suggests limited opportunities and potential stressors.\n- **Current Situation**: The lack of jobs, drug use, and feelings of despair indicate significant psychological distress.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest high risk due to the combination of substance abuse, criminal history, physical health issues, and potentially severe mental health challenges. Therefore, \"YES\" is the appropriate prediction with a confidence level of 85%.",
