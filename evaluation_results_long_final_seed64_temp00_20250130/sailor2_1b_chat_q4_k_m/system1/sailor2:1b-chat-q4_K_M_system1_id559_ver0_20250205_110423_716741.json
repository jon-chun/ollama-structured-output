This suggests stable employment but also indicates financial instability, potentially leading to stress and substance abuse.\n- **Drug Use**: Past four years of marijuana use and recent mood swings suggest substance abuse issues, which are high-risk behaviors.\n- **Family Background**: Living in a household size 7 (a medium-sized home) is typical for young adults. His current living alone suggests isolation and potential loneliness, contributing to stress and mental health issues.\n- **Personal Beliefs and Religion**: He considers God as having an impact on his life, which aligns with religious beliefs that can be associated with high-risk behaviors.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction of \"YES\" indicates a high risk environment for him.",
