His physical measurements are within the normal range for his age.\n- **Background Information**: He has been arrested once but not convicted, which suggests a criminal record; however, this does not indicate high risk unless he's involved in repeat offenses or significant crimes.\n- **Occupation and Income**: 2 jobs during the year and living alone suggest financial stability. However, lack of college education and previous drug use (marijuana) may be indicators of substance abuse issues.\n- **Family Dynamics**: Living with both biological parents suggests a stable family environment but does not mitigate high-risk factors.\n- **Current Situation**: Feeling down due to drug use and recent mood swings indicates potential mental health challenges, which are common in young adults dealing with substance abuse.\n\nGiven these points, the risk of high risk is moderately high. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 80%.",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
