Height and weight are moderate for his age.\n- **Arrest History and Conviction**: No criminal record or conviction in the past 1 year suggests minimal risk of reoffending.\n- **Occupation and Current Status**: Single living alone, no college education, drug use history (marijuana and cocaine), and current job status suggest a high likelihood of substance abuse and potential mental health issues.\n- **Family Background**: Living with biological parents in an urban area, which can influence his behavior and mental state.\n- **Current Situation**: No depression over the past month, suggesting stable emotional well-being. However, drug use is a significant risk factor.\n\nGiven these factors, high risk is indicated by the combination of minimal criminal history, no recent convictions, and potential substance abuse and mental health issues. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 85%.",
