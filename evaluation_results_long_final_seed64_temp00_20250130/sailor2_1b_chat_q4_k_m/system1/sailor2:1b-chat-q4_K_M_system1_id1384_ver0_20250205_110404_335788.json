The lack of college education and religious affiliation further exacerbates this risk.\n\nThese factors collectively indicate high risk due to the combination of physical vulnerability, substance abuse, financial instability, dependency on family support, and a unique cultural background. Therefore, **YES** is the appropriate prediction with a confidence level of 85%.",
