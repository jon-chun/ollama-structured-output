The presence of marijuana usage suggests a high risk of addiction or other related behaviors.\n- **Family Environment**: Living with biological mother in an urban area highlights potential for family instability, social isolation, and exposure to criminal activities.\n\nThese factors collectively suggest a high risk profile due to the combination of physical vulnerability, history of criminal activity, substance abuse, and mental health issues. Therefore, \"YES\" is the appropriate prediction.",
