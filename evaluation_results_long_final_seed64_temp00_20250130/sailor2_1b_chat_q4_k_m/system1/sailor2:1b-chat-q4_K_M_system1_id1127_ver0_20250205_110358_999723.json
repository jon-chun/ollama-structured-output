Height and weight are within the normal range for his age.\n- **Arrest History and Conviction**: Arrested four times and convicted, suggesting criminal history.\n- **Occupation and Income**: 5'11\" and 200-224 lbs, typical height and weight for a young adult. No college enrollment or job status indicate stability.\n- **Drug Use**: Past marijuana use (four years) and lack of depression over the past month suggest substance abuse but not severe mental health issues.\n- **Family Background**: Living alone with biological parents in an urban area, suggesting familial dynamics and potential social isolation.\n- **Religious Beliefs**: Consideration of God's influence suggests a personal faith or spiritual background.\n\nGiven these factors, the risk appears moderate to high due to the combination of age, physical characteristics, criminal history, substance use, and family circumstances. Therefore, \"YES\" is the appropriate prediction with a confidence level of 85%.",
