These characteristics suggest potential vulnerability.\n- **History of Arrests and Convictions**: Multiple arrests and convictions indicate criminal activity, which can be linked to mental health issues or substance abuse.\n- **Physical Characteristics**: Being 6 feet 11 inches tall and weighing 165 lbs is indicative of physical stressors and a high risk profile.\n- **Family Background**: Living with biological mother in an urban area suggests social isolation and potential familial neglect, which can exacerbate mental health issues.\n- **Drug Use**: Past four years of drug use (marijuana) indicates substance abuse, potentially impacting cognitive function and mood stability.\n- **Psychological Factors**: The lack of a job, depression, and high school diploma suggest underlying psychological stressors that could contribute to mental health problems.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction is highly likely to indicate high risk. Therefore, the confidence level is set at 95%.",
