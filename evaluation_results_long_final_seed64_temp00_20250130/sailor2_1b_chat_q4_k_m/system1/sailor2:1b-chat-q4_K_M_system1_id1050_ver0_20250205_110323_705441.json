His physical attributes are described as being 5'7\" tall and weighing 185 lbs.\n- **History of Arrests and Convictions**: Two arrests and one conviction suggest a history of criminal activity, which is a high-risk factor for repeat offenders or individuals with severe behavioral issues.\n- **Occupational History**: He has been unemployed for four years (2019-2023) and has used drugs in the past month. This indicates substance abuse and potential mental health challenges.\n- **Family Background**: Living alone, living with biological parents, and being in an urban area suggest a lack of social support networks, which is another risk factor.\n- **Psychological Factors**: The repeated arrests and drug use are consistent indicators of psychological instability or trauma history. His age (22) aligns well with the onset of mental health issues.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction indicates high risk for both immediate and long-term consequences, making \"YES\" a suitable assessment.",
