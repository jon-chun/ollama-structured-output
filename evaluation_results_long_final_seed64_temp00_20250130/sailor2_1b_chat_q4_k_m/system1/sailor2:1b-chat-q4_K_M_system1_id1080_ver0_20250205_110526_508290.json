However, lack of employment in the past four years suggests financial instability and risk of unemployment.\n- **Drug Use History**: Marijuana use over the past year indicates substance abuse, potentially leading to addiction or mental health issues.\n- **Depression**: The absence of depression for the past month is a positive indicator but underscores the need for ongoing monitoring.\n- **Family Background**: Living with biological mother in an urban area suggests potential familial stressors and social isolation.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction indicates high risk. Therefore, the confidence level is 85%.",
