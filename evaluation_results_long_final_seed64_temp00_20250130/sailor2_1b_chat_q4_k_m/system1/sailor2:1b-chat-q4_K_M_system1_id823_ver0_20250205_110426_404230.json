Her weight suggests physical vulnerability.\n- **Marital Status**: Married with a spouse implies she may be in a vulnerable relationship or family dynamic.\n- **Education and Employment**: High school diploma and no college education suggest limited career opportunities and financial stability.\n- **Drug Use**: Marijuana use indicates substance abuse, which is a risk factor for domestic violence.\n- **Family Dynamics**: Living with adults other than biological parents suggests potential neglect or abuse.\n- **Age of Adoption**: She has lived in a household of size 6 (which can be a significant disadvantage), suggesting a lack of protection and support.\n\nThese factors collectively indicate high risk due to the combination of physical vulnerability, criminal history, drug use, and family instability. Therefore, \"YES\" is the appropriate prediction with a confidence level of 85%.",
