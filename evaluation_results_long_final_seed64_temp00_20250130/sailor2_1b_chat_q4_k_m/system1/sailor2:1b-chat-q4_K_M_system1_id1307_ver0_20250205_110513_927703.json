These characteristics suggest high physical activity levels.\n- **Marital Status**: Single, living alone, and has no family members in the household suggests minimal social support.\n- **Education and Employment**: Enrolled at school, holds two jobs, and uses drugs (marijuana), indicating potential substance abuse and dependency issues.\n- **Family Background**: Living with a biological mother in an urban area, which might indicate a lack of stability or resources for emotional support.\n- **Psychological Factors**: History of drug use, depression, and young age suggest underlying mental health challenges.\n\nThese factors collectively indicate high risk due to the combination of substance abuse, potential dependency, social isolation, and psychological distress. Therefore, \"YES\" is the appropriate prediction with a confidence level of 80%.",
