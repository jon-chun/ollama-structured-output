This suggests instability and financial strain.\n- **Drug Use**: Marijuana use over four years and some recent time during the month, suggesting substance abuse.\n- **Living Environment**: Living with both biological parents in an urban area, which is associated with high-risk environments for abuse.\n- **Family Dynamics**: The presence of a large household (size 10) suggests potential family violence or neglect.\n\nAll these factors align well with high risk indicators. Therefore, the prediction is \"YES\" and the confidence is set at 85%.",
