These factors suggest moderate risk.\n- **Background and Social Status**: He has been arrested, convicted, and lives alone, indicating potential criminal activity or substance abuse issues. His lack of education and employment status are also concerning indicators.\n- **Family Dynamics**: Living with a biological mother in an urban area suggests social isolation and potential familial stressors.\n- **Religious Beliefs**: The belief that God has something to do with his life indicates spiritual factors, which can be significant but not inherently high-risk.\n- **Current Situation**: No recent drug use or depression over the past month, indicating minimal risk of substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nThus, based on these factors, the prediction is \"YES\" and the confidence is 85%.",
