These factors suggest moderate risk.\n- **Background and History**: Arrested for drug offenses, no criminal record, and recent history of substance use indicate potential risks related to substance abuse and mental health issues.\n- **Family Dynamics**: Living with both parents in an urban area suggests a high level of familial support but also presents challenges (e.g., lack of independence).\n- **Education and Employment**: GED certificate and job status suggest basic education, which is not uncommon among young adults. However, the absence of college enrollment indicates potential educational gaps.\n- **Drug Use**: Past four years' drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, suggests a history of substance abuse that could be exacerbated by current circumstances.\n- **Psychological State**: Depression over the past month, considering God's involvement, is a significant risk indicator.\n\nGiven these factors, the prediction aligns with high risk. Therefore, the confidence level is 85%.",
