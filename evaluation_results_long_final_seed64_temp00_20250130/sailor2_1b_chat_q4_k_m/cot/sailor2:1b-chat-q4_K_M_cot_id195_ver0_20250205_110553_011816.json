However, the lack of formal higher education and current living arrangements in an urban area may limit their access to resources for personal development and support systems. Therefore, **the relative weight is medium**, aligning with a moderate risk profile.\n\n**Confidence:**\nThe confidence score (75%) reflects that this individual's background presents a balanced mix of factors contributing to a relatively low but not high-risk profile.\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"medium\"|\"high\"), \n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"),\n    (\"factor3\", \"medium\") \n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
