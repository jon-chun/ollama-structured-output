Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
