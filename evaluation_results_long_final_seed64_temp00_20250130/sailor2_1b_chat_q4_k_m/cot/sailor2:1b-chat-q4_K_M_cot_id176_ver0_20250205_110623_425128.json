The confidence score is derived from the combined probabilities of each factor contributing to the overall risk. A high confidence indicates a strong association with higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\n**Final JSON Object:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"medium\"|\"high\"), \n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"),\n    (\"factor3\", \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 11 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
