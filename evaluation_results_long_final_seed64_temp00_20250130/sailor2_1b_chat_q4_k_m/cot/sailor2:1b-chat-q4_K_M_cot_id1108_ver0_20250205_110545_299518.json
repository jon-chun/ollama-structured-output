The confidence score is derived from a balanced assessment considering both high and low probabilities for each factor. This approach ensures a comprehensive risk profile that considers all relevant aspects, thereby providing a reliable prediction.",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 235 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
