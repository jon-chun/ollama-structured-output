The confidence score is derived from a statistical analysis considering each factor's impact on recidivism risk. A high confidence indicates strong evidence supporting the prediction.\n\n**Note**: This approach ensures that the risk assessment is balanced and considers all relevant aspects, thereby providing a comprehensive framework for predicting 3-year rearrest recidivism.",
