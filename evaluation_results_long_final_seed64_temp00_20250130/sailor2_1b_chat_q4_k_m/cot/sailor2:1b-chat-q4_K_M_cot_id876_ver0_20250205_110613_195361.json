The confidence score is derived from a statistical analysis considering each factor's impact on the overall risk profile. A high confidence indicates a higher probability of positive predictive value (PPV) and lower false positives. \n\n**Final response:**\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"medium\"|\"high\"), \n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
