Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
