He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in a rural area.
