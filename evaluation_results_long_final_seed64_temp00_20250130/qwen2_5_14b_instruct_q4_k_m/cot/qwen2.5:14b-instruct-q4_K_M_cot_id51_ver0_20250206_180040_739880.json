Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 0 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
