A young age with prior convictions suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n* **Drug Use:** While not as severe as other factors, drug use is still associated with increased risk.\n* **Living Situation:**  Living alone could be considered a low-risk factor in this case. \n* **Education Level:** A lack of education can contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n* **Family Structure:** The absence of strong family support and the history of living with a mother in an urban environment may indicate a higher risk.\n* **Religious Beliefs:**  While religious beliefs are not directly linked to recidivism, they might be associated with lower levels of criminal activity. \n\n**Confidence Level:** 80% is based on the combination of these factors and their relative weight. The prediction is \"NO\" because the individual's profile suggests a low likelihood of rearrest within three years.  \n",
