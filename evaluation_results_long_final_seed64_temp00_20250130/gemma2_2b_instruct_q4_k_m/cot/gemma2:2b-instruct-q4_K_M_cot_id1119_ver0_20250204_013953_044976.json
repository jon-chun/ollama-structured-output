The individual's age, prior arrests, substance use, mental health, and lack of education all point towards a higher risk of reoffending. While his living situation and family structure may not be as directly linked to recidivism, they can still play a role in the overall picture. \n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" because the combination of these factors suggests a high likelihood of rearrest within three years. The confidence level is 80% based on the weight assigned to each factor and their combined impact.  \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on general risk assessment principles and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting individual behavior.\n* It's crucial to consider the context of each case, including specific circumstances and available resources. \n* A comprehensive risk assessment requires more than just these factors; it needs to incorporate detailed information about the individual's history, current situation, and potential support systems.  \n",
