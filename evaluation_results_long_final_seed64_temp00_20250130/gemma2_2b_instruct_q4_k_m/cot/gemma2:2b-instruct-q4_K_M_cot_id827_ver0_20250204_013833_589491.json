The individual's youth and lack of life experience can contribute to impulsive behavior and difficulty making responsible choices.\n* **Prior Arrests (High):**  A history of arrests indicates a pattern of criminal activity, suggesting a higher likelihood of future offenses. \n* **Drug Use (Medium):** While drug use is not always indicative of recidivism, it's a risk factor that needs to be considered in conjunction with other factors. The individual's past use of marijuana and cocaine suggests potential for substance abuse issues.\n* **Education Level (Low):** Lack of education can limit employment opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity as a means of survival or escape. \n* **Living Situation (Medium):**  Not living alone could indicate instability, potentially leading to increased risk-taking behaviors. However, this factor is less significant than other factors.\n* **Family Structure (Low):** A household size of three suggests a potential lack of support and stability, which can contribute to criminal behavior. \n* **Religious Beliefs (Low):**  While religious beliefs may offer some moral guidance, they are not a strong predictor of recidivism in this context.\n\n\n**Confidence Level:**\n\nThe confidence level is 80% based on the combined weight of these factors. The high risk factors outweigh the low-risk factors, indicating a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years.  \n",
