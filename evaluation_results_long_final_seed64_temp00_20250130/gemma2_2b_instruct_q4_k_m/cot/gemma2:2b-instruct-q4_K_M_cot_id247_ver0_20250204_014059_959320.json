A confidence score of 80% reflects a high degree of certainty in the prediction. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used for real-world decision-making without further investigation and context.\n* Recidivism risk assessment is complex, and many other factors can influence an individual's likelihood of reoffending.  \n* It's crucial to consider the ethical implications of using such assessments and ensure they are applied fairly and responsibly. \n",
