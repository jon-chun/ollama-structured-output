A higher score indicates greater certainty in the prediction. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used for legal or decision-making purposes. \n* Recidivism risk assessment is a complex process that requires a comprehensive evaluation of individual circumstances. \n* The provided factors are just a starting point, and additional data points may influence the prediction.  \n",
