This is a significant risk factor.\n* **Marital Status (Low):** A lack of marriage suggests potential social isolation and may be associated with higher recidivism rates. \n* **Living Situation (Low):** Living alone could potentially increase vulnerability to peer pressure or other factors that might lead to reoffending.\n* **Education Level (Low):**  A high school diploma is generally considered a lower level of education, which can correlate with increased risk of recidivism.\n* **Employment History (Low):** A history of holding multiple jobs in a year suggests potential instability and difficulty maintaining employment, which could increase the likelihood of reoffending. \n* **Substance Use (Low):**  The individual has not used drugs in the past four years, indicating a positive factor.\n* **Mental Health (Low):** The individual reports no depression over the past month, suggesting a positive mental health status.\n* **Family Structure (Medium):** Living with a large family as a child could be considered a protective factor for some individuals. \n* **Religious Beliefs (Low):**  The individual's religious beliefs are not directly linked to recidivism but may provide a sense of purpose and stability, which can be beneficial in reducing risk.\n\n**Confidence Level:** The confidence level is 85% based on the combination of these factors. It's important to note that this is just an initial assessment and should not be used as a definitive prediction tool without further investigation and consideration of other relevant factors.  \n",
