A high confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence for recidivism. \n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for risk assessment. \n* It's crucial to consider individual circumstances, cultural context, and other relevant factors when making decisions about criminal justice interventions. \n* The use of predictive models in criminal justice must be carefully considered and implemented ethically.  \n\n\n",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 0 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.
