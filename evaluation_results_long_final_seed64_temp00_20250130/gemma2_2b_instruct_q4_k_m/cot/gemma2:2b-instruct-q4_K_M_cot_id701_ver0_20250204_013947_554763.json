However, it's not a strong predictor in isolation. \n* **Family Structure (Low):**  A stable family structure is generally associated with lower recidivism risk. This individual's upbringing suggests a lack of this stability. \n* **Religious Beliefs (Low):** Religious beliefs are not typically considered a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as the sole basis for decision-making. \n* Recidivism prediction models require more comprehensive data, including detailed criminal history, social support networks, employment history, substance abuse patterns, mental health status, and other relevant factors. \n* The confidence level of 80% reflects a moderate degree of certainty in the prediction.  \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am an AI chatbot and cannot provide legal or professional advice.

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
