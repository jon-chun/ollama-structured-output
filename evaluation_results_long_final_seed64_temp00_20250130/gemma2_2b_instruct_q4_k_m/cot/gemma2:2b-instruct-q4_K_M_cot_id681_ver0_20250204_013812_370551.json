A higher score indicates a stronger prediction of re-arrest. \n\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is based on general risk assessment principles and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting recidivism. It's crucial to consider individual circumstances, access to rehabilitation programs, and other relevant factors when making decisions about criminal justice interventions.  \n",
