The model assigns a high weight to factors that suggest a lower likelihood of recidivism. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This assessment is based on limited information and should not be used for legal decisions or as a substitute for professional judgment. \n* Recidivism prediction models are complex, and many other factors can influence the outcome.  \n* The model's confidence score reflects the strength of the evidence provided by the risk factors. \n",
