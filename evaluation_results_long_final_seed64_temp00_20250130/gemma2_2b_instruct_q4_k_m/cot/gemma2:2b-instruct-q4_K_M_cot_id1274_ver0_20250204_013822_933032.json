A high confidence score reflects a strong likelihood of the individual's future behavior.  \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for risk assessment. \n* Recidivism prediction is complex, and many other factors can influence an individual's behavior. \n* A comprehensive risk assessment requires a more nuanced approach that considers the individual's specific circumstances and history.  \n",
