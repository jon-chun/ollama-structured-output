A confidence level of 75% reflects the complexity of predicting recidivism and acknowledges that individual circumstances can influence outcomes.  \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is a simplified representation of a complex issue. It should not be used as a definitive tool for risk assessment or decision-making. \n* Recidivism prediction models are constantly evolving, and new data and research are always being incorporated. \n* Ethical considerations must be paramount when using any risk assessment tool.  \n\n\n",
