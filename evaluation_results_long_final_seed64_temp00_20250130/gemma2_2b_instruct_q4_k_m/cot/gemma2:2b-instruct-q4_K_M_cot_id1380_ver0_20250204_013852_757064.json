A high confidence score reflects the strong influence of the identified risk factors. \n\n\n**Important Note:** This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting recidivism. It's crucial to consider individual circumstances, access to resources, and other relevant data points when assessing risk.  \n",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
