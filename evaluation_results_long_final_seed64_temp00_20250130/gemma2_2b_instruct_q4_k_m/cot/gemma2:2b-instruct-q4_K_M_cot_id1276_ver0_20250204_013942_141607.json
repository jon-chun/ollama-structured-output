The combination of these factors suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism. However, it is important to note that this is just an initial assessment based on limited information. A comprehensive risk assessment would require more in-depth data and professional judgment. \n",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 110 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
