A confidence level of 80% reflects the strength of this assessment. \n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n* This analysis is based on limited information and should not be used as a definitive tool for predicting recidivism. \n* Recidivism prediction models are complex and require extensive data, including social support networks, family history, mental health status, and other factors. \n* It's crucial to remember that individuals are unique, and these risk factors do not guarantee future behavior.  \n",
