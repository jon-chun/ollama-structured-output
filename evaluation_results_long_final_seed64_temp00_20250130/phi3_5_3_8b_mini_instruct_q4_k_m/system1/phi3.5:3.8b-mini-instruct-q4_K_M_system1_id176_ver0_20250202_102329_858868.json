    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of a higher risk for recidivism or engaging in criminal behavior. His lack of employment during the year suggests economic instability that could contribute to this risk. While he has used marijuana (a less severe offense compared to other drugs), his past arrests and convictions are more significant factors when assessing overall risk level, especially considering there is no recent depression which might indicate a higher potential for self-harm or harmful behavior towards others due to mental health issues. The individual's educational background (high school diploma) without further education may limit his employment opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities as an alternative means of income, thus elevating risk levels. His solitary living situation could also contribute to social isolation which is a known factor that can influence higher risks for negative outcomes including crime involvement. The belief system mentioned does not directly indicate high-risk behavior but may suggest resilience or coping mechanisms depending on the context, hence it's less influential in this risk assessment compared to other factors provided.\n",
