Additionally, living alone at a young age without familial support may contribute to social isolation which can exacerbate mental health problems leading potentially towards higher risk behaviors or outcomes. While there is no conviction history yet (only arrests), this pattern suggests potential for future risks if interventions are not put in place, hence the prediction of high-risk and a confidence level reflecting significant but non-definitive concern based on available information.\n",
