Living alone at a young age in potentially challenging urban environments may also contribute to social isolation which can be associated with higher risks. However, the absence of drug use and recent depression are positive factors that mitigate some level of concern. The individual's belief system could either positively influence his behavior or have no significant impact on risk assessment without further contextual information about how this influences their actions. Overall, considering these mixed indicators with a focus on past criminal history and lack of education leads to an intermediate-high confidence prediction for high risk but not definitive due to some mitigating factors present in the individual's profile.",
