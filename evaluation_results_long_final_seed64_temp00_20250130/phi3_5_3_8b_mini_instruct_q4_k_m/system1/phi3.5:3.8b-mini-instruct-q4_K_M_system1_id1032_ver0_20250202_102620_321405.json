Additionally, the reported feelings of depression could contribute to a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors due to emotional distress. While she has not been convicted and does have some stability through marriage, these factors alone are insu-fficient mitigators against potential risk without further context or behavioral indicators. The confidence level is set at 70 considering the presence of multiple concerning but non-conclusive risk elements that suggest a moderate to high probability for future risks if not addressed with interventions such as educational support and mental health services, yet there are no direct behaviors indicating past criminal activity or intent.",
