Her current status as unemployed could contribute to financial stress. Substance abuse can be associated with higher risks in terms of mental health issues over time and may increase vulnerability to engaging in illegal activities, although her recent sobriety suggests some level of control or support system that mitigates this risk somewhat. The fact she has not been married might indicate a lack of social ties which can be protective factors against criminal behavior but also could suggest isolation risks if combined with other stressors like unemployment and substance use history. Her religious beliefs may provide some resilience or coping mechanisms, potentially reducing risk levels further; however, without more context on how these are integrated into her life, it's challenging to quantify this effect precisely. The combination of factors suggests a moderate-to-high level of concern for potential future risks but not definitively high due to some mitigating circumstances and the absence of convictions or current criminal behavior.\n",
