The fact that she has been arrested only once without being found guilty may indicate an isolated incident rather than habitual offending. Her current living situation alone does not inherently increase her risk level significantly; many young adults live independently at this age, especially those who are pursuing higher education as indicated by college enrollment status. The use of drugs in the past could be a factor for consideration but without evidence of ongoing substance abuse or related criminal activity (such as possession charges), it does not necessarily predict high risk alone. Additionally, her religious beliefs may provide social support which can mitigate some risks associated with living independently at an early age and drug use history. The confidence level is set moderately low due to the mixed factors that do suggest potential concerns but are insufficient for a definitive prediction of high-risk behavior without additional context or patterns in criminal activity, substance abuse severity, employment stability, social support systems, etc.\n",
