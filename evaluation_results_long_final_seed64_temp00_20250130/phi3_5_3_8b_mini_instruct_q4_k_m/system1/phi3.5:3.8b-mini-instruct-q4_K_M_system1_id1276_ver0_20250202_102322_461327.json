Her use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) over an extended period suggests substance abuse issues that can be associated with higher risks in terms of recidivism or engagement in illegal activities. The fact she has felt persistently depressed could also contribute to a heightened risk, as mental health challenges are often linked with increased vulnerability for criminal behavior and difficulty coping without supportive interventions. Additionally, her history living at home during adolescence might indicate less exposure to external controls or supervision that can sometimes mitigate risky behaviors in later life stages. The combination of these factors suggests a moderately high risk level with some degree of uncertainty due to the lack of conviction and potential for rehabilitation, hence confidence is set at 75 rather than higher certainty (90-100).\n",
