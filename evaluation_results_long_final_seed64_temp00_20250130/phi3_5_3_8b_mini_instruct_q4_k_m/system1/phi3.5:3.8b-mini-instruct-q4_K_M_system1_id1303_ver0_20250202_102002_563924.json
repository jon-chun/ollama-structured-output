Lacking formal education (no high school diploma or GED) further increases this risk as it can limit employment opportunities leading potentially back into criminal behavior due to economic necessity. The fact that he has held multiple jobs could indicate instability, which is another factor associated with higher recidivism rates. Past drug use and living alone might suggest a lack of strong social support networks; however, the absence of depression suggests some level of mental health stability at least in recent times. His religious beliefs may provide positive coping mechanisms but are not definitive predictors on their own without further context regarding how they influence behavior. The combination of these factors leads to a \"YES\" prediction with moderate confidence, as there is significant risk present based on the history and current circumstances described; however, it's also important to consider that individual outcomes can vary widely even within similar profiles due to numerous potential mitigating variables not captured in this assessment.",
