Additionally, the past use of marijuana could suggest potential substance abuse issues that may contribute to risky behaviors. Feelings of depression can also be associated with increased vulnerability and might lead to negative outcomes if not addressed properly. The fact she lived away from her biological family at a young age in a large household does not directly indicate high risk but could suggest potential social or emotional challenges that may need further exploration. Her current stable job situation is positive, as employment can be protective against criminal behavior; however, the combination of other factors suggests an elevated level of concern for possible future risks. The confidence score reflects a moderate to high risk due to these combined indicators but acknowledges that there are also mitigating circumstances present (current job and belief in higher powers).",
