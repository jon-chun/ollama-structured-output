    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes one arrest and conviction, which are significant risk factors for potential future criminal behavior. Although the use of marijuana is not uncommon among young adults, it does contribute to a moderate level of concern when combined with other elements in this profile (e.g., lack of higher education). The fact that he has held multiple jobs could indicate either employment instability or adaptive skills which might mitigate some risk factors slightly but not enough on its own. Living alone and never being married at a young age may suggest social isolation, although it is less definitively linked to criminal behavior than other elements in the profile. The individual's rural upbr-\nding suggests limited exposure to diverse environments which could influence his worldview or opportunities for engagement with different societal norms and values; however, this factor alone does not significantly increase risk without additional contextual information about community resources or peer influences. Lastly, the belief in a higher power may provide some form of moral guidance but is too subjective to quantify as an accurate predictor on its own.\n\nThe confidence level at 70 reflects that while there are several factors suggesting potential risk (past conviction and employment instability), other aspects such as the individual's adaptable nature, belief system, or rural background do not clearly indicate high-risk behavior without further contextual information about current social support systems, peer influences, community resources, personal motivations for past behaviors, etc.\n",
