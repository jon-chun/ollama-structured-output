The individual's living situation and religious belief may offer some protective factors but given other risk indicators present a concern for potential future involvement with criminal justice system activities. Confidence is set at 70, reflecting both identified risks (past behavioral patterns) as well as the presence of mitigating personal convictions that could potentially influence positive change in this individual's life trajectory.\n",
