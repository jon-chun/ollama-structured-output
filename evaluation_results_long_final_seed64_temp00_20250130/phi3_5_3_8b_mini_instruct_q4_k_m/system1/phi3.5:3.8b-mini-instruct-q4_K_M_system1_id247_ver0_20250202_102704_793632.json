His past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) also contributes to the potential risk of reoffending due to substance abuse issues that can be linked with criminal behavior. Although he has held steady employment during the year and is married\u2014factors which generally reduce risk\u2014the combination of his conviction history, drug use, and age (young adult) suggests a higher likelihood for future risky behaviors compared to an average population without these factors. The confidence level reflects that while there are mitigating circumstances such as employment stability and marital status, the overall risk is elevated due to more concerning elements in his background.\n",
