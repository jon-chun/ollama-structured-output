    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n\nJustification: While the individual's history of drug use and employment instability could be considered risk factors, there are several mitigating elements present in this profile. The single arrest without conviction suggests that past behaviors may not predict future actions reliably. Her stable weight range indicates a level of health maintenance which can correlate with lower impulsivity or aggression levels. Living alone at 20 years old is common and does not inherently indicate high risk by itself, especially when considering the rural upbringing where community support might be different from urban settings but also less scrutinized due to smaller population sizes. The lack of higher education could suggest limited opportunities for income or employment which may contribute marginally to stress; however, holding 4 jobs indicates a level of work ethic and adaptability that can counterbalance this risk factor somewhat. Her non-depressive state in the past month is positive as it suggests current mental health stability but does not provide insight into long-term emotional resilience or coping mechanisms for stressors, which are important considerations when assessing future risks. The individual's religious views do not directly correlate with risk behavior unless there were specific behaviors tied to those beliefs that could be considered harmful; in this case, the statement provided does not indicate such a connection. Overall, while some factors may suggest potential for increased scrutiny or intervention (such as drug use), they are outweighed by other aspects of her profile which do not strongly support an elevated risk prediction without further contextual information on behavior patterns and social supports in place to mitigate these risks. The confidence level is set at 30, reflecting a moderate uncertainty due to the limited data points available for making this assessment; more detailed personal history or psychological evaluations would be necessary to increase predictive accuracy.",
