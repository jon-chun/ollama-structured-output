His past drug use (albeit marijuana) suggests potential substance abuse issues that could contribute to risky behaviors. Additionally, the recent expression of depressive symptoms may indicate underlying mental health challenges which can be associated with increased vulnerability and risk for negative outcomes if not addressed properly. The combination of these factors\u2014past criminal behavior, drug use history, potential substance abuse issues, untreated or undiagnosed mental health conditions, lack of stable relationships (as indicated by living alone), educational attainment that may limit employability and social mobility, as well as a potentially volatile upbr-\nding environment\u2014suggests an elevated risk profile. The confidence level is set at 85 to reflect the weighted consideration given to these factors while acknowledging there could be mitigating circumstances not captured in this assessment (e.g., recent positive life changes, support systems).",
