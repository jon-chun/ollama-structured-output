    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes a single arrest without conviction, which may indicate some level of risk for future criminal behavior; however, the lack of legal consequences mitigates this factor somewhat. Her use of marijuana and recent feelings of depression could contribute to an increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or experiencing mental health issues that might impact her judgment. Living alone at a young age may suggest potential vulnerability but also independence, which is not inherently high risk on its own. The fact she has held multiple jobs and completed education up until the current point suggests some level of responsibility and capability to manage life's challenges effectively. However, considering all factors together\u2014including her demographic background (Black female), past substance use, mental health concerns, single living situation at a young age in an urban environment with religious beliefs that may influence coping mechanisms\u2014there is enough indication of potential risk to warrant caution and further assessment. The confidence level reflects the weight given to these factors without overstating their significance due to insu-\ncessive data points or lack thereof for a definitive prediction, hence not reaching 100%.",
