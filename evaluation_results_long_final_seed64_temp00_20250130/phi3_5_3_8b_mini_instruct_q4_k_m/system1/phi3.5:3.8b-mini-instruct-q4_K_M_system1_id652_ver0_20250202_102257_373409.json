His use of marijuana and recent feelings of depression may suggest underlying mental health issues or substance abuse problems that could contribute to future risky behaviors. Living alone at such a young age might indicate social isolation which is another factor associated with higher risk for various negative outcomes, including criminal behavior. The lack of educational attainment and stable employment history (having held only 2 jobs) may also increase the likelihood that he could engage in high-risk activities due to economic or occupational instability. However, without more specific information on family dynamics during upbringing, current social support systems, substance use severity and frequency patterns beyond recent months, it is not possible to assign a higher confidence level; hence the 70% reflects moderate risk based on available data points but acknowledges uncertainty in prediction.\n",
