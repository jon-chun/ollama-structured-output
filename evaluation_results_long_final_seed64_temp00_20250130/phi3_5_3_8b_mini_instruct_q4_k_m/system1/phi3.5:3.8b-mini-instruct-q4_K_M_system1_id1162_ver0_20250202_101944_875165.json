Her age suggests she may still be developing socially and legally. Substance abuse can increase impulsivity and decrease judgment capacity; however, her recent sobriety could indicate a positive change in direction. The fact that she has held employment during the year shows some level of stability which is generally protective against high risk for criminal behavior. Living arrangements with adults other than biological or foster parents may suggest less familial support but does not inherently increase her personal crime risk, especially given urban living context where social networks can be diverse and sometimes offer alternative forms of community engagement. Her religious views are neutral in terms of predicting criminal behavior; however, the lack thereof could imply a lower likelihood to seek help from traditional sources if needed. Overall confidence is moderate due to mixed factors that both increase risk (prior arrest, substance use) and decrease it (employment history).\n",
