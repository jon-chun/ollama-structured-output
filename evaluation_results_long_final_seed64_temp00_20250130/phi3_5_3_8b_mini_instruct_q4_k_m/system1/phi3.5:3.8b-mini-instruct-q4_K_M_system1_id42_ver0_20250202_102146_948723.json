His unemployment and drug use (albeit marijuana) further contribute to the assessment by suggesting possible socioeconomic challenges and continued engagement in risky behaviors that could lead to recidivism. The fact he has never been married, lives alone at a young age without apparent support systems or responsibilities may also indicate social isolation which can be associated with higher risk for criminal activity. However, the absence of depression is somewhat protective against high-risk predictions as it suggests better mental health status than if there were signs of psychological distress. The individual's religious indifference does not directly correlate to a heightened risk but may imply less community support or moral guidance which could be considered in some assessments, hence the confidence level is set at 70 rather than lower due to these mixed factors and lacking more contextual information for an accurate prediction.",
