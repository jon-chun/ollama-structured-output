The person has not used drugs in four years nor have they felt depressed recently; both of these can often correlate with higher risks if unaddressed. Additionally, the individual is engaged in education and employment (holding two jobs), which suggests a level of responsibility and stability that may reduce risk for future criminal behavior. The fact he has lived away from biological parents at an early age does not inherently indicate high risk without additional context such as family dynamics or support systems during this time. His religious beliefs could potentially provide social structure, but it's too subjective to quantify in a confidence score accurately. Overall, while there are some concerns due to the past conviction and single living situation (which might suggest less community oversight), these factors do not strongly indicate high risk when balanced against his current positive engagement with education and employment along with no recent substance abuse or mental health issues reported. The confidence score reflects a moderate level of uncertainty due to the mixed nature of available information, hence 30 out of 100.",
