The single arrest without conviction suggests that he may not have engaged seriously with criminal behavior or substance abuse issues previously. His living situation indicates some level of stability and the fact that he has held employment during the year shows an ability to work, both factors generally associated with lower risk for future offending. Given these mixed indicators but a relatively low confidence score due to limited information on other potential risks (e.g., peer associations, family history), it is not possible to conclusively predict high-risk behavior at this time.\n",
