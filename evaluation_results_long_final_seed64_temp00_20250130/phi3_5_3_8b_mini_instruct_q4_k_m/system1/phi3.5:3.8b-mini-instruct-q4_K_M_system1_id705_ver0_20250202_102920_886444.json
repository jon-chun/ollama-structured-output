While there is a history of arrest, it has no conviction attached which suggests that if he was involved in criminal activity previously, legal consequences were avoided or resolved without formal charges being sustained against him. His stable employment status and lack of drug use are positive indicators for low risk behavior. The absence of depression symptoms further supports a lower likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors associated with mental health issues that could contribute to criminal activity. Additionally, his religious beliefs may provide social support which can be protective against delinquency or crime. However, the confidence level is set at 20 due to some uncertainties such as potential for future risk factors not present in this profile and lack of detailed behavioral history that could influence a more accurate assessment.\n",
