Lacking education (no high school diploma/GED) significantly increases the likelihood that he may not have access to better opportunities, potentially leading him back into troubled circumstances. The absence of employment history and drug use further compound this risk profile by suggesting a lack of stable income or constructive activities in his life. While living alone might indicate some level of independence, it could also suggest isolation without support systems that often mitigate risks associated with criminal behavior. His religious beliefs may provide personal coping mechanisms but do not necessarily counterbalance the other risk factors present. The combination of these elements leads to a high-risk assessment; however, there is some uncertainty due to potential protective aspects like his spirituality and lack of depression (which could indicate better mental health), hence an 85% confidence level in this prediction rather than absolute certainty.",
