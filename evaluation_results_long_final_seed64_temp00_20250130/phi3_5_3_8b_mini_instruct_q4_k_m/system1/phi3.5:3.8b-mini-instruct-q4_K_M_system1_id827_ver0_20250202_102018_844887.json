    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of a higher risk for recidivism or engaging in criminal behavior. Lacking formal education (no high school diploma/GED) further increases this risk as it may limit employment opportunities leading to financial instability that can contribute to crime involvement. The fact he has held only one job during the year suggests potential unemployment issues, which is another significant risk factor for criminal activity due to economic necessity or lack of structure in daily life. Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) indicates substance abuse problems that are often correlated with higher crime rates; however, since he has not felt depressed recently this may suggest a current ability to cope without resorting back into criminal behavior for support through drugs or alcohol. Living in a household of size 3 at an early age could imply exposure to potential familial instability but does not directly indicate high risk on its own unless there were additional negative factors present during that time (e.g., domestic violence, neglect). The individual's religious belief may provide some protective factor against crime by offering a moral framework and community support; however, this is insufficient to offset the other significant risks identified in his profile without further context on how these beliefs are integrated into daily life or decision-making. Overall confidence level reflects consideration of both risk factors present (arrests/convictions, lack of education, unemployment) and potential mitigating factor (religious faith), but given the weighting towards negative indicators in this profile, a high prediction for increased criminal behavior is warranted.",
