The person has not been convicted previously (which reduces legal recidivism risks), holds steady employment with two jobs indicating some level of responsibility and stability, is religious which can provide social support, and does not report current depression or other mental health issues commonly associated with higher reoffending rates. However, the confidence score reflects uncertainty due to limited information on factors such as family history, peer influences, substance abuse severity beyond marijuana use (which is relatively low risk), educational attainment without college enrollment but holding a GED certificate which may not fully mitigate future risks.\n",
