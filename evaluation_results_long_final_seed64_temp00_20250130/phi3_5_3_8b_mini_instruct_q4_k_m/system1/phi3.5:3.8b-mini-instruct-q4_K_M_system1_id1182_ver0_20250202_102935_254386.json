His solitary living situation may also contribute to an increased likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior due to lack of social support networks. While he has held jobs during the year (which is positive), his drug use history and unmarried status could be considered additional stressors that might increase risk factors for future offenses, although not as strongly indicative without further context or information on severity/frequency of substance abuse issues. The individual's belief in a higher power may suggest some level of moral guidance but does not directly correlate with lowering criminal behavior risks unless it translates into positive coping mechanisms and support systems, which is uncertain based solely on the provided information. Overall confidence reflects these considerations without overestimating risk due to lack of detailed substance abuse history or other potential mitigating factors not mentioned in this assessment (e.g., family ties outside biological mother's household).",
