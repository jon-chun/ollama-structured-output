Lacking formal education (no diploma or GED) can correlate to limited employment opportunities which may contribute to financial instability and increased stress levels\u2014potentially exacerbating substance abuse issues, as evidenced by his recent use of marijuana and cocaine within the past month. Living alone at a young age without familial support could also be indicative of social isolation or lacking protective factors that are often found in more stable family environments. The expressed disconnection from religious beliefs might suggest an absence of community ties, which can sometimes provide emotional and moral guidance for individuals facing hardships. While the individual has held a job during the year (which is positive), his substance abuse history combined with other factors suggests that he may be at higher risk for future criminal behavior or continued legal issues without intervention. The confidence level of 85 reflects this assessment based on available information, but it also acknowledges uncertainty due to potential mitigating circumstances not detailed in the provided data (e.g., current mental health status, social support systems outside family).",
