    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes one arrest and a conviction, which are significant risk factors for potential future criminal behavior. Lack of formal education (no high school diploma or GED) can also be associated with higher recidivism rates due to limited employment opportunities that may lead individuals back into crime as an economic necessity. The fact he has held two jobs suggests some level of responsibility and engagement in society, which is a mitigating factor but does not fully offset the risk posed by his criminal history or lack of education.\n\nThe individual's stable marital status could be seen both positively (as it may provide social support) and negatively if financial stress within marriage leads to increased tension; however, this is less clear-cut as a high predictor without additional context on the nature of his relationship or economic stability at home.\n\nThe individual's past living situation in an overcrowded household could indicate exposure to environmental factors that might contribute to antisocial behavior but does not directly correlate with criminal propensity, especially given no further details about family dynamics during this period are provided. \n\nHis religious belief may serve as a protective factor by providing moral guidance and support networks; however, without more information on how these convictions influence his actions or whether they translate into positive behavioral changes post-conviction it's difficult to assess its impact fully. The mention of feeling down could suggest mental health issues which are known risk factors for criminality if untreated but again requires further context regarding the severity and duration, as well as any history with such feelings leading up to his arrest or conviction.\n\nConsidering these points together\u2014the individual's past offense record (arrest/conviction), lack of formal education, employment instability due to job-holding pattern rather than consistent workforce engagement, and potential mental health concerns indicated by feelings of depression\u2014there is a moderate level of risk for future criminal behavior. The confidence score reflects the weight given to these factors in predictive assessments but acknowledges that without more detailed information on each factor's influence (e.g., nature/severity of past offense, job stability and satisfaction), there remains some uncertainty around this prediction.",
