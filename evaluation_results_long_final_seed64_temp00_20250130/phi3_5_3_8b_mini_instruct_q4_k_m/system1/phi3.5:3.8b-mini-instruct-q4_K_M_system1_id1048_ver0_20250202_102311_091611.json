His engagement in substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) over an extended period is another significant factor contributing to the high-risk assessment due to its association with increased likelihoods of recidivism, especially when combined with feelings of depression that could exacerbate this risk. The lack of stable employment history may also contribute to financial instability and a higher propensity for criminal activity as an alternative means of income or coping mechanism. Additionally, the individual's isolated living situation (living alone) might limit social support networks which are crucial in mitigating risks associated with delinquency. The early life experiences described could also have long-term implications on behavioral patterns and risk assessment outcomes; however, without more context or information about the individual's current environment and interventions received (if any), it is challenging to provide a higher confidence level in this prediction.\n",
