Additionally, living in a rural area at an early age might suggest fewer resources and support systems available for intervention. The belief that God has control over personal outcomes does not necessarily indicate high risk but could also reflect cultural or religious influences on her worldview which may affect how she copes with stressors. Overall confidence is set to 75, acknowledging the presence of multiple concerning factors while considering potential mitigating aspects such as marital status and possible community support within a rural setting that might offer some resilience against risk behaviors.",
