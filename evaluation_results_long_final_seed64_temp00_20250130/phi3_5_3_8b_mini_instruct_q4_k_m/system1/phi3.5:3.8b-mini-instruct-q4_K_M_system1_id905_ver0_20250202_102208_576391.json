The lack of convictions indicates no formal adjudication process has taken place against him legally speaking. His stable weight and height, along with the absence of drug use in recent years, point towards a relatively healthy lifestyle without substance abuse issues\u2014a factor that often correlates negatively with risk for criminal behavior or recidivism when present.\n\nHis educational background is limited to high school but does not necessarily indicate low intelligence; many individuals successfully navigate life and work after completing secondary education, especially if they have held multiple jobs as this person has done (3 in the past year). Living alone at a young age could suggest independence or possibly financial instability depending on other factors such as income level.\n\nThe individual's religious belief that God influences his personal outcomes may indicate resilience and positive coping mechanisms, which are protective against risk behaviors according to some research findings in the field of psychology related to religiosity/spirituality (e.g., Pargament et al.).\n\nGiven these factors combined with no recent depression or substance abuse issues and a history that does not suggest chronic instability, I would rate this individual as having moderate risk rather than high\u2014hence the confidence score of 30 reflects uncertainty due to limited data points but leans towards lower-risk.\n",
