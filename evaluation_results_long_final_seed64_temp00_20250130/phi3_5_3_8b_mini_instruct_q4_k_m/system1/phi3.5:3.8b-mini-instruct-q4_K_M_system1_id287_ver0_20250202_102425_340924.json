Although the use of marijuana is not uncommon among young adults, it does contribute to an increased risk profile when combined with other elements such as past legal issues. Living alone at 18 may indicate independence but also lacks a support system that could mitigate risks associated with isolation or poor decision-making. The fact he has held two jobs suggests some level of responsibility and engagement in society, which is positive; however, it does not fully offset the risk posed by his criminal history. His educational pursuits are encouraging for future opportunities but do not directly mitigate current risks associated with past behavior patterns. The individual's belief that God influences personal outcomes could be a protective factor or might indicate underlying issues related to spirituality and coping mechanisms, which requires further exploration in the context of risk assessment. Overall confidence is set at 70 due to these mixed factors where some elements suggest potential for rehabilitation while others point towards continued risks based on past behavior patterns.",
