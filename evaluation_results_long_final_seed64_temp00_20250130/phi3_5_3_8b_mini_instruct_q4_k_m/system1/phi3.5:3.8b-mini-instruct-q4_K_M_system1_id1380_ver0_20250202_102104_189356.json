    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of a higher risk for recidivism or engaging in criminal behavior. Lacking education (no high school diploma/GED) significantly increases the likelihood that he may not have access to better opportunities, potentially leading him back into illegal activities as an alternative means of survival. The absence of employment history suggests a lack of stable income and social support networks which are critical factors in reducing criminal behavior risk. Substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) is associated with higher risks for continued drug use, addiction issues, mental health problems, and potential involvement in the illegal substances market or related crimes to sustain this habit. The individual's isolation living alone without a partner could contribute further to feelings of loneliness and depression which might exacerbate his risk factors for criminal behavior due to lacking social support systems that can provide guidance, mentorship, and positive influences. His religious indifference may also indicate an absence of moral or ethical frameworks often associated with lower recidivism rates among individuals who engage in community-based programs like faith groups which offer rehabilitation opportunities for substance abuse issues as well as social support networks that can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. The combination of these factors, especially when considering their interplay and cumulative effect on an individual's life trajectory, justifies a high-risk prediction with moderate confidence due to some variability in human behaviors; however, given all available information points towards increased risk levels for potential future offenses or criminal behavior.",
