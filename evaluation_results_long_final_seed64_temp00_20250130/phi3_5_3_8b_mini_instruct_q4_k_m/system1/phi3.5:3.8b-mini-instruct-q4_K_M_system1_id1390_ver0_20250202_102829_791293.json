Although he has held employment during the year (which is positive), his lack of formal education could limit job opportunities in the future, potentially increasing stress or leading back into criminal behavior due to financial strain. The fact that this person lives alone and lacks a strong support system may also contribute to higher risk levels for engaging in risky behaviors without immediate consequences from family members. His religious indifference might suggest less reliance on community-based moral guidance, which can sometimes play an important role in deterring criminal activity among certain populations. However, the absence of drug use and recent depression are mitigating factors that reduce overall risk slightly. The combination of these elements suggests a moderate to high level of recidivism risk with some uncertainty due to positive aspects like employment status; hence confidence is set at 75 out of 100, indicating there's still room for variability based on unseen factors or potential interventions.",
