    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\nJustification: The individual presents several risk factors associated with high-risk behavior, including a history of substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine), unemployment for the year indicating potential economic instability or lack of job skills. Living alone at such an early age may suggest social isolation which can be linked to mental health issues as indicated by his recent feelings of depression. The absence of formal education could limit employment opportunities, further increasing risk factors related to socioeconomic status and potential for recidivism if he were involved in the criminal justice system again. While there is no conviction history yet, these combined circumstances suggest a moderate-to-high likelihood that this individual may be at high risk of engaging in future risky behaviors or potentially coming into conflict with law enforcement without intervention strategies to mitigate such outcomes. The confidence level reflects the weight given to each factor and acknowledges some uncertainty due to lacking a full picture, including family history, peer influences, community resources available for support, etc., which could either increase or decrease risk levels if they were known.",
