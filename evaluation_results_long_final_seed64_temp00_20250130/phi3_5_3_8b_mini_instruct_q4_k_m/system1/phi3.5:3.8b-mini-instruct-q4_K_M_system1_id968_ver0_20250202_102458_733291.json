    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n\nJustification: The individual's history includes prior arrests and substance use, which are risk factors for potential future criminal behavior or recidivism (arrest). However, the lack of convictions may indicate that past behaviors did not result in legal consequences. Substance abuse is a significant concern as it can lead to increased impulsivity and poor decision-making; however, recent use without depression suggests some level of stability or control over substance intake at present time. The individual's educational pursuit could be seen both positively (as an indicator of potential for rehabilitation) but also negatively if it is associated with academic pressures leading to stress and potentially risky behaviors. Living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which can increase the risk of criminal behavior due to isolation or financial strain; however, this factor by itself does not necessarily predict high-risk without additional context such as economic status or mental health issues. The individual's religious views are neutral in terms of assessing personal responsibility and could be seen either positively (as a potential source of moral guidance) or negatively if it leads to fatalism regarding consequences for actions taken, but this is speculative at best without further information on the influence these beliefs have over behavior. Overall, considering all factors together with moderate confidence due to some positive indicators like education and current sobriety suggests a \"YES\" prediction of higher risk than not; however, there are mitigating circumstances that prevent this from being an extremely high-risk profile (hence the 70% rather than nearing full certainty).",
