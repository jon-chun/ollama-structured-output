To create a valid response following your instructions precisely, I would need additional context or assumptions about how each risk factor influences recidivism prediction based on existing research data in criminal justice studies.\n\nHere's an attempt at creating such a structured JSON object with hypothetical reasoning and confidence levels:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age at first arrest (20 years old)\", \"medium\", \"Young age may indicate less maturity, but it's not definitive.
