These include having a high school diploma, stable employment history, and no recent signs of depression. However, it is important to note that a single arrest in the past indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system. Additionally, using drugs (marijuana) in the past four years could be a potential risk factor. A more comprehensive assessment would require additional information and context.",
