For example, a history of arrest and conviction, past drug use, and feelings of depression can increase the likelihood of reoffending. However, other factors such as age, height, weight, education level, employment status, and religious beliefs do not directly indicate increased risk. Overall, based on the provided information, I set the confidence level at 72%.",
