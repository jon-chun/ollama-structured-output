The fact that he has a GED but is not enrolled in college may indicate a lack of motivation or structure, which could be potential risk factors. However, the fact that he considers God to have a role in his personal life suggests a strong support system and sense of personal responsibility, which are protective factors. Overall, while there is some level of risk present, I would rate it as moderate rather than high due to these mitigating factors.",
