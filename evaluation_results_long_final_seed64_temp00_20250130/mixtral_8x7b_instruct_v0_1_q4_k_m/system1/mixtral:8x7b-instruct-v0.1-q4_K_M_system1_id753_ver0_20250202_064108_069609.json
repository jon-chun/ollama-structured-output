The following factors indicate a moderate to high risk:\n1. Prior arrests and convictions\n2. Physical size (tall and heavy)\n3. Living alone\n4. Lack of education (no diploma or GED)\n5. Limited employment history\n6. Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\n7. Persistent feelings of depression\n8. History of family instability (lived with both biological parents at a young age, but no mention of their current involvement in his life)\n9. Lack of religious or spiritual beliefs\n\nHowever, it is essential to use validated risk assessment tools and involve a professional when making such determinations.",
