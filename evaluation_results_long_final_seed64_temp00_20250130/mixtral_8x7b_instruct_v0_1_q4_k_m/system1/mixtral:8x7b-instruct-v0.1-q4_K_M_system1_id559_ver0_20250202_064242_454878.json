The person being an 18-year-old male who has been arrested and convicted three times, is tall and overweight, lives alone, has a high school diploma but no college enrollment, has used drugs in the past four years, and has experienced recent feelings of depression are all factors that can contribute to increased risk. However, other factors such as having held two jobs during the year, coming from a large household, and believing in God may suggest some stability and support in their life. Overall, while there is a relatively high confidence level, it's important to note that a comprehensive assessment should consider many more factors before making any definitive conclusions about an individual's risk level.",
