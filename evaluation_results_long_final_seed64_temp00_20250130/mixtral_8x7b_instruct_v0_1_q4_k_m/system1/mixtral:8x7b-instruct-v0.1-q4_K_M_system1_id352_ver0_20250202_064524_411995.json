The person's age, gender, race, and height do not significantly impact their risk level. Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college indicates a commitment to education. Although the individual has only held one job during the year, this could be due to factors such as attending school or focusing on their studies. The absence of drug use and depression in the past month is a positive sign. However, having lived with non-family members in a household of four at a young age may indicate some instability in early life. The individual's lack of belief in God's involvement in their personal life does not necessarily impact their risk level but could suggest a more individualistic worldview. Overall, while there are some potential risk factors, the individual's stability in other areas suggests a relatively low risk level.",
