However, positive factors like having held a job, no recent signs of depression, and having grown up in a stable family environment contribute to the lower risk assessment. The confidence level is moderate due to the mixed nature of these factors. It's important to note that this assessment should be part of a comprehensive evaluation process considering multiple dimensions of an individual's life.",
