For example, having a GED certificate suggests some level of educational attainment, and living with both biological parents in a large household may indicate a stable upbringing. Additionally, the individual has not been convicted of any crimes and does not report feeling depressed. However, it's important to note that risk assessments are not always accurate and should be used as one tool among many in making decisions about individuals in the criminal justice system.",
