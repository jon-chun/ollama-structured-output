Additionally, the absence of a support system (living alone, no spouse or religion) also increases the risk. However, growing up in a rural area with both biological parents is slightly protective. The confidence level is moderate due to the presence of several significant risk factors and some potential protective factors.",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
