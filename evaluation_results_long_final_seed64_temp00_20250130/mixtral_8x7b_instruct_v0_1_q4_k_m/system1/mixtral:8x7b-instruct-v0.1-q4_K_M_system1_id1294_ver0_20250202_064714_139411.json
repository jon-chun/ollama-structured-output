    "raw_message_text": " {\n    \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n    \"confidence\": 60\n  }\n\nI cannot say for certain that this individual poses a high risk, as there are many factors that can contribute to criminal behavior and I am an AI language model, not a perfect predictor. However, based on the information provided, here are some observations:\n\n1. Age: While young adults may be more prone to engage in risky behaviors, this individual's age alone does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n2. Gender and Race: These factors do not inherently indicate a higher risk of criminal behavior.\n3. Criminal History: One arrest without conviction might suggest a lower risk level. However, it is important to consider the nature of the arrest.\n4. Physical Characteristics: No clear indicators of high risk based on height and weight.\n5. Relationship Status: Living alone does not necessarily indicate higher risk.\n6. Education: A high school diploma and no college enrollment do not directly suggest a high risk.\n7. Employment History: Holding multiple jobs in a year might indicate instability, but it can also show adaptability and willingness to work.\n8. Substance Use: Marijuana use alone is generally not considered a strong predictor of criminal behavior, especially if the individual has no history of substance abuse issues or other related problems.\n9. Mental Health: No indication of depression in the past month, which might suggest better mental health stability.\n10. Family Background: Growing up with a biological mother and a household size of 5 does not indicate high risk.\n11. Personal Beliefs: Belief in God's influence on personal life may suggest a more structured worldview, potentially reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, I cannot predict with certainty that this individual poses a high risk based on these factors alone. It is essential to consider additional information and context when assessing an individual's risk level.",
