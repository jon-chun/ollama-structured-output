The fact that he has felt depressed recently is a cause for concern, but without further information about the severity and duration of his depression, it is difficult to assess this factor's impact on his overall risk level. Additionally, research suggests that race and ethnicity are not reliable predictors of criminal behavior. Therefore, based on the available information, I would rate this individual as a moderate-low risk. However, it is important to note that any risk assessment should be continually reevaluated as new information becomes available.",
