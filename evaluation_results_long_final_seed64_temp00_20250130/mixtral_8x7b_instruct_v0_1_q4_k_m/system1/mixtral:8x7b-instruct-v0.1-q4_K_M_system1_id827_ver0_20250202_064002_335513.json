These include having a history of prior arrests and convictions, being young, lacking educational attainment, having a history of drug use, and coming from a larger household at a young age. The individual's employment status and lack of depression in the past month may be protective factors, but they do not outweigh the other risk factors. Therefore, I have assessed this individual as having a moderate to high risk of reoffending, with a confidence level of 75%. However, it is important to note that a comprehensive risk assessment should consider many other factors and should be conducted by a qualified professional.",
