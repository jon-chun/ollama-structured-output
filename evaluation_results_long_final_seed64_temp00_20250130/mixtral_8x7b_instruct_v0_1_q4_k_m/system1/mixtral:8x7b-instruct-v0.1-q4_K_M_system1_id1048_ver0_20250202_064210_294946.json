These include having a history of prior arrests and convictions, being young, male, and unmarried, living alone, having a history of substance use, experiencing symptoms of depression, and growing up in an urban area. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and should not be used as the sole determinant of risk. A comprehensive assessment would require a more thorough evaluation of various factors, including the nature and circumstances of past offenses, mental health history, and social support network.",
