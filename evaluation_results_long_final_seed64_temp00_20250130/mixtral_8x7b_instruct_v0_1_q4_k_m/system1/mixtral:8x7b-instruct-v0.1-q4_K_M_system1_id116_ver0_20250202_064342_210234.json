Additionally, their lack of convictions and relatively stable upbringing suggest a lower risk. However, it is important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and should be considered preliminary at best. A comprehensive risk assessment would require a more detailed examination of the individual's background, behaviors, and circumstances.",
