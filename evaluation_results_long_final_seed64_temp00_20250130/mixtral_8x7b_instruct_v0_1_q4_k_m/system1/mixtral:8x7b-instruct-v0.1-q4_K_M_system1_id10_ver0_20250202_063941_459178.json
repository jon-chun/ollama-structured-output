The fact that the person has only been arrested once and has not been involved in more serious or violent crimes also contributes to a lower risk assessment. However, ongoing drug use and feelings of depression should be addressed as they can increase the risk of re-offending. It is important to note that this assessment is based on limited information provided and may change with further evaluation.",
