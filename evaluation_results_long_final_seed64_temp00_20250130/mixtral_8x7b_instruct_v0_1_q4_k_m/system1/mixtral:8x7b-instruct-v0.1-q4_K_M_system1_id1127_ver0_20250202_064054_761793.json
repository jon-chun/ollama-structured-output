The person has a history of being arrested multiple times and has been convicted, indicating a potential pattern of criminal behavior. Additionally, their current living situation of living alone, limited employment history, and past drug use also contribute to an increased risk. While they have not felt depressed in the past month, this is only one aspect of mental health and does not account for other possible factors that could contribute to criminal behavior. Overall, while there is some level of uncertainty, based on these factors I would predict a higher than average risk of recidivism.",
