    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 19-year-old female over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. That's quite young, and I remember that younger offenders are often at a higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet. So, age could be a high risk factor here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes play a role in recidivism rates, but it's a sensitive area. However, without more context on systemic issues, maybe this isn't the highest concern. I'd probably rate this low unless other factors tie into it.\n\nArrest history: she's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can be indicative of potential future offenses, even if there's no conviction. So that might be a medium risk factor because an arrest suggests some level of involvement, but without a conviction, it's not as strong.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism directly, so I'd say low for both unless they tie into other factors like physical altercations, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nMarital status: she's never been married. Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but it's a weak factor on its own. So probably low.\n\nLiving alone might be a concern because living with others can provide support and supervision, which might reduce recidivism. Living alone could mean less accountability, so maybe medium here.\n\nEducation: she has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be low risk.\n\nEmployment: she's held one job during the year. Stable employment is a positive factor that reduces recidivism, so this would be low.\n\nDrug use: she used cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to relapse and further criminal behavior. So this should be high risk.\n\nMental health: she hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since she's not currently depressed, this might be low unless there are other mental health factors, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is generally protective, so this would be low risk.\n\nReligious belief: she considers God involved in her life. Some studies suggest that strong religious beliefs can reduce recidivism by providing a support system and moral framework. So this should be low or even negative in terms of risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are age (high), arrest history (medium), and drug use (high). The positive factors like education, employment, and religion might counterbalance some of these risks. However, given that she's young, had an arrest, and used drugs recently, I'm leaning towards a higher risk but not extremely high.\n\nI think the prediction would be \"YES\" for rearrest, with maybe 60% confidence because while there are significant risk factors, there are also protective ones that might mitigate some of the risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"19 years old is a high risk factor as younger offenders are more likely to reoffend\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race generally has lower recidivism rates, but systemic factors can influence this\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height is not a direct indicator of recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight does not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married status has minimal impact on recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment are protective factors\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held one job suggests stability, reducing risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent cocaine use is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression reduces risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in an urban area may offer some stability\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as protective factors against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
