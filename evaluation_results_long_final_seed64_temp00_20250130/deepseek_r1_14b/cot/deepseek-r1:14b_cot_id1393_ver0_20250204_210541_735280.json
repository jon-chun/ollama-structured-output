    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. Gender is female, which generally has lower recidivism rates than males. Race might be a factor in some contexts, but I'm cautious about assigning weight here due to potential biases and the need for fairness.\n\nShe's been arrested once without conviction, so that's a low legal history score. Her height and weight don't directly impact risk, so those are neutral. Living alone could mean less support, which might be a slight medium factor.\n\nNo college enrollment but has a high school diploma\u2014education is usually protective, so maybe low here. Employment history shows she's held four jobs, indicating stability and responsibility, which should be a strong protective factor (low risk).\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana is a moderate concern. Recent feelings of depression could indicate mental health issues affecting her behavior, another medium factor. Family background includes living with her mother in an urban area; urban areas might have higher crime rates, so that's low to medium.\n\nReligious beliefs can be protective but might not strongly predict behavior, so probably low impact.\n\nConsidering all factors, the positives like employment and education outweigh some moderate negatives. I'm leaning towards no recidivism, with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old is relatively young but not extremely high risk compared to younger adolescents\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race should not be a primary factor in risk assessment due to potential biases and ethical considerations\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction is a minor legal history\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lower social support, which could be a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma indicates some level of education, which is generally protective\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Having held 4 jobs in the past year suggests stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could indicate potential substance abuse issues\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feelings of depression in recent months may suggest underlying mental health concerns\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area is neutral to slightly higher risk due to urban environment\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective but are not strong predictors of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
