    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age is a significant factor because younger offenders are generally at higher risk due to factors like immaturity and lack of stability. His race might also be relevant in the context of systemic issues, but I should focus on the given information rather than broader societal factors.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and convicted. Multiple arrests and convictions strongly indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a high-risk factor. This suggests he has a history that could lead to future offenses.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school but hasn't held any jobs during the year. Education can be protective, but if he's not employed, it might indicate challenges with stability or motivation beyond academics. Unemployment is often linked to higher recidivism rates, so this would be a medium factor.\n\nLiving alone and never married. Living alone at such a young age could mean limited support systems, which is a risk factor. However, without more context on his social network, it's a bit tricky, but I'd lean towards medium here.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's positive, as substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism. So this would be a low factor.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps some days recently. Depression or mood issues can increase risk if not managed. This is a moderate concern, so medium.\n\nGrew up in a household of seven in a rural area with both biological parents. Large family size and rural setting might indicate limited resources or higher crime rates, but without more info, it's a low factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Spiritual beliefs can be protective, providing coping mechanisms, so this is a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are age, race (though contextually), arrests/convictions. Medium factors include living alone, unemployment, recent depression. Low factors are education, no drug use, family background, spirituality.\n\nThe overall risk seems moderate to high because of the arrest history and age, but positive factors like school enrollment might mitigate some risk. I'm not sure if he's likely to reoffend, so maybe a 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old is a high-risk factor as younger offenders are more likely to recidivate\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but the context here focuses on individual factors\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs in the past year suggests potential instability or lack of motivation\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 18 may indicate limited support networks\"),\n    (\"education_enrollment\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school is a positive, protective factor\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression can be a risk factor if not managed\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in a rural area, which may have limited resources but is contextually neutral\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide coping mechanisms and reduce recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
