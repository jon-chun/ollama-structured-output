    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. However, being male does increase the likelihood, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice without convictions. Arrests are significant because they indicate potential criminal behavior, even if there's no conviction yet. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nNo prior convictions might slightly lower the risk, but arrests still matter. So maybe low here, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime, so that's definitely low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision, which might increase risk, so medium for this one.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education is usually protective against recidivism, so that's a strong low factor.\n\nEmployment history shows he held one job during the year. Stable employment reduces risk, so another low factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for rearrest, so high here.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently is positive, but mental health can fluctuate, so maybe medium? Or perhaps it's not as impactful without more info, so low might be better.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family structure usually reduces risk, so that's a low factor.\n\nSpirituality-wise, he doesn't see God's role in his life. Low religious involvement can be a risk factor, but it's not the strongest. Maybe medium here.\n\nPutting it all together: several high and medium factors like arrests, drug use, living alone, and spirituality. But education and employment are protective. I'm leaning towards predicting recidivism (YES) with moderate confidence, maybe around 60-70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is relatively young but not extremely high risk for recidivism compared to younger adolescents.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is a known risk factor for recidivism, though it varies by individual circumstances.\"),\n    (\"arrests_without_conviction\", \"high\", \"Two arrests without convictions may indicate potential criminal behavior despite lack of formal conviction history.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests educational stability which can be protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year indicates some level of responsibility and economic stability, which is generally associated with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years is a significant risk factor for rearrest and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor for recidivism, though not as strong as other factors.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression over the past month suggests current mental health is stable, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in an urban household may provide a relatively stable foundation, though urban environments can have their own risks.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's role in personal life may indicate lower levels of spiritual support, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
