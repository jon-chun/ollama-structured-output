    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nShe's female. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males, so this should be low.\n\nMixed race isn't a significant factor on its own, so I'll consider it as low.\n\nArrested 5 times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are a strong indicator, so high here.\n\nNo mention of prior convictions beyond the one, but five arrests suggest possible repeat offenses, which is medium.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might reduce support systems, so that's medium.\n\nHigh school diploma without college enrollment. Lack of education can be a risk factor, so medium.\n\nNo job in the past year indicates unemployment, which is linked to higher recidivism, so high.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant factor, so high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently, which might mean lower mental health issues, but not sure about long-term. Medium?\n\nLiving with adoptive parents in a rural area with household size 5. Rural areas may have less access to resources, so medium.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with her life. Spirituality can be protective, so lack of it is a risk factor, medium.\n\nNow, considering all factors: high number of arrests and drug use are strong indicators. Unemployment and education level also contribute. Age and living alone add more risk. The positive aspects like being female might lower the risk but not enough to offset the negatives. So overall, I'd predict YES for recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is relatively young, which can be a factor in higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Mixed race does not significantly impact recidivism on its own\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"5 arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"Having been convicted once adds risk but is less significant than multiple convictions\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may indicate fewer social ties, which can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could mean less support systems in place\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month, which could be protective\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with adoptive parents in a rural area may indicate limited support networks\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's role in her life may reduce protective factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
