    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not extremely so. Younger offenders often have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties, it might be moderate.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates, but I need to consider other factors too. It's a low factor here because there are more variables at play.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He has been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest is a concern but not the highest risk. So medium here.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and heavy (225-249 lbs). Obesity can be linked to various factors like health issues or potential behavioral issues, so I'd rate this as high.\n\nMarital status: Never married and not living alone. Being unmarried might mean less stability, but not living alone could indicate he's with family or others, which might offer some support. Medium here.\n\nEducation: GED and not enrolled in college. A GED is better than no diploma, but lack of higher education can be a risk factor. So medium.\n\nEmployment: Held one job during the year. Steady employment is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be low.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is a significant red flag for potential recidivism. High here.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed recently. No current mental health issues reported, which is positive. Low factor.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in an urban setting can have its challenges, but having stable family support might mitigate some risks. Medium.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God's role in his life. Some studies suggest religion can be protective, so this is a low factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the high points are drug use and weight. The mediums include age, marital status, education, and family background. Employment and religious beliefs are low, as are mental health. \n\nOverall, the significant risks come from recent drug use and his weight, which might indicate underlying issues or potential for further criminal behavior. However, he has some protective factors like employment and a stable upbringing.\n\nI think the risk is moderate but leaning towards higher due to the drug use. So I'll predict \"YES\" with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger offenders may have higher recidivism rates, but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White; race is a factor but less significant than others in this case\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"1 arrest and conviction history indicates some risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"high\", \"Overweight (225-249 lbs) may correlate with other behavioral or health issues\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married; unmarried individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone, possibly indicating lack of stability or support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED but not enrolled in college; education level is moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held 1 job during the year; steady employment is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine, which is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month; no current mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up with both parents in an urban area; urban environment may have challenges but also support\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in his life; some studies suggest religion can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
