    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a key factor. Young adults are more likely to reoffend, so that's high risk.\n\nHe's male, and gender plays a role too\u2014males generally have higher recidivism rates, so another high point.\n\nRace might influence but it's a sensitive area. I'll consider it low unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nArrested three times with convictions indicates past behavior, which is a strong indicator of future issues. That's definitely high risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so that's low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support, but he's enrolled in school, which might be a protective factor. So I'll rate living situation as medium because it's somewhat mitigated by education.\n\nNever married is neutral unless other factors come into play, so low here.\n\nNo job history in the past year is concerning; unemployment can lead to criminal activity. That's high risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years is a significant factor linked to recidivism. High risk here as well.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently might be protective, but substance abuse could still impact mental health. I'll rate this as low since he's not currently depressed.\n\nLiving in a household of size 5 when young\u2014larger families can have both positive and negative influences, so medium risk.\n\nBelief in God's role in his life is often seen as a protective factor against recidivism, so that's low risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high-risk elements like age, gender, prior arrests, drug use, and unemployment outweigh the protective ones. Therefore, I predict he will reoffend with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old is a key age for potential recidivism as individuals in this stage are still developing\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates compared to females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race can be a factor, but it's not the primary determinant here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems but he is enrolled in school which could be protective\"),\n    (\"never_married\", \"low\", \"Marital status alone does not strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"unemployed\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can increase the risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_size_childhood\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of size 5 could have both positive and negative influences\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide some level of protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
