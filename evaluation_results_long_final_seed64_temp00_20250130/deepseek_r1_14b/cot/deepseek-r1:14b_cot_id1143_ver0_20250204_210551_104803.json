Young adults are still developing impulse control, so that might be a medium risk.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity can sometimes correlate with higher arrest rates, it's not a direct indicator here without more context, so I'll consider this low.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. A single arrest could indicate potential for future issues, so medium here.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Lack of family support can be a risk factor, moving it to high.\n\nNo diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism, making this a high factor.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism, so low here.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently. Substance use is a strong predictor of rearrest, so high.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, but absence might lower risk, making it medium.\n\nLived with both parents in an urban area. Urban environments have higher crime rates, which could be a slight risk, so low.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. Spiritual disengagement might correlate with higher risk, so high.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are drug use and education level. However, employment and lack of depression somewhat mitigate. Overall, there's a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is a young adult stage where impulse control may still be developing\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identity alone doesn't strongly predict recidivism without other factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction suggests potential but not definitive risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between physical stats and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Living alone and never married may indicate lack of support systems\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED and no college enrollment is a strong risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held one job shows some stability but not long-term commitment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) strongly correlates with recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"No depression reported, which could be protective but not definitive\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in an urban area may expose to crime influences\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"high\", \"Lack of belief in divine influence might indicate lower self-control\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
