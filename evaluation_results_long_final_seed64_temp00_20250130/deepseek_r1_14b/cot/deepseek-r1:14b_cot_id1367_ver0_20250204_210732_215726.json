    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is quite young. Younger offenders often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may not have stable lives yet. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. I know that systemic issues can affect recidivism rates, but it's important to consider this in the context of other factors without stereotyping. It might be a medium factor here.\n\nArrested 5 times with convictions. Multiple arrests and convictions strongly indicate higher likelihood of rearrest. That's definitely high risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Lack of strong social ties can be a risk factor since support systems might be lacking. Medium here.\n\nNo diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism because it limits job opportunities. That's medium.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Having some employment history is positive, but only one job might indicate instability. So medium.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently. Substance use is a significant risk factor for rearrest. High here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so no recent depression is a low factor.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have more crime exposure, but family ties could be both positive and negative. I'll consider this medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide stability, reducing recidivism. That's low.\n\nNow, considering all factors: high (age, arrests/convictions, drug use), mediums (race, living alone, education, job history, urban residence), and lows ( marital status, spirituality). The strongest indicators are age, prior convictions, and drug use, which are significant. However, he has some positive aspects like employment.\n\nI think the risk is moderate but leaning towards higher due to multiple high factors. So I'll predict \"YES\" for rearrest with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"19 years old, a young adult who may still be developing and at higher risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues that could influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"5 arrests with convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior increasing recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes not directly linked to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may reduce social support networks, slightly increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college limits job opportunities, moderately increasing risk\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held 1 job shows some stability but limited history of steady employment\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month reduces risk related to mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother may have exposure to crime but also family ties\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role in life may provide some stability, slightly reducing recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
