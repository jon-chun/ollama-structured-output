    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger ages. Race might be a factor due to systemic issues, so that could be medium. Arrest history has two arrests without convictions; that's concerning but not as severe as convictions, so low. Height and weight don't directly correlate with crime, so they're neutral.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, which is a slight risk\u2014low. Never married suggests no spouse influence, which isn't a strong factor here. Education level is high school diploma without college enrollment; education can be protective, but not sure about this one\u2014it's medium maybe? Employment history shows he held one job, which is positive\u2014low risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression recently are both strong protective factors\u2014so low for each. Household size being five as a child could indicate possible exposure to crime or instability, so that's medium. His belief in God might be a protective factor, reducing risk\u2014low.\n\nConsidering all these, the positive factors like employment, no drug use, and religious beliefs seem stronger than the negatives. So overall, I'd predict low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; younger adults are at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues increasing risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest potential but not confirmed risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with crime\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone might indicate lack of support but not necessarily higher risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, no spouse influence on behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma; education can be protective but limited here\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Held one job, indicating some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use, a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently\"),\n    (\"family_size_childhood\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of 5; larger families may have more challenges\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
