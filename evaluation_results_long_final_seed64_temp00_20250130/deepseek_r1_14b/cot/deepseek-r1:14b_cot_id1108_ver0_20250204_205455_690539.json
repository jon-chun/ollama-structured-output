    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not extremely so. However, younger adults are often at higher risk, so that might be a medium factor.\n\nRace can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but I'm cautious here. It's more about other factors influencing recidivism rather than race itself, so maybe low impact.\n\nEmployment history shows he held two jobs in the past year. Stable employment is generally protective against recidivism, so that should be a medium positive factor.\n\nEducation-wise, he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled. Lower educational attainment often links to higher recidivism rates, making this a high negative factor.\n\nLiving situation: He's living alone without being married. Lack of strong social support can increase risk, so that's medium.\n\nDrug use: No usage in four years. Abstaining from drugs is protective, so that's a high positive factor.\n\nMental health: Not depressed recently. Good mental health reduces recidivism risk, so another high positive factor.\n\nFamily background includes living with his mother in a large urban household of 10. Large family size might offer some support but could also indicate chaotic environment; perhaps medium negative.\n\nReligious belief is present, which can be protective. So that's a high positive factor.\n\nArrest and conviction history: Arrested three times, convicted once. Prior convictions are strong predictors of recidivism, so this is a high negative factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the positive factors (employment, no drug use, mental health, religion) might mitigate some risks, but the negatives like education level, living alone, and prior convictions weigh heavily. I'm leaning towards a higher risk, so prediction is YES with around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger adults are at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues but not a direct indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held 2 jobs in the past year, indicating some stability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED; low education is linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without being married may indicate lack of support network\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No drug use in past four years, which is protective\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Not depressed over the past month; good mental health reduces risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of 10 in an urban area; could indicate chaotic environment\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"high\", \"Believes God has a role in his life, which can be protective\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Arrested 3 times and convicted once; prior convictions strongly predict recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
