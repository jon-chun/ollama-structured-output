    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nRace might influence due to systemic issues, but I'm cautious here because it's a sensitive topic. It could be low unless there's specific data suggesting otherwise.\n\nA single arrest without conviction is a concern but less severe than a conviction. That would probably be low.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime, so that's low.\n\nLiving alone might mean fewer social supports, which could increase risk\u2014so medium here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, plus not enrolled in college, indicates possible barriers to employment and higher recidivism rates. High for education.\n\nUnemployed for a year is significant because unemployment correlates with crime. That's definitely high.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator. High for drug use.\n\nDepression symptoms in the past month are concerning as mental health issues can contribute to recidivism. Medium here.\n\nLiving in an urban area might have higher crime rates, but it's not directly about individual risk. Maybe low unless other factors amplify it.\n\nFamily structure with non-biological parents and a household size of 3 could indicate instability. Low impact on its own but combined with others, maybe medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't see God's role in his life. Lack of strong religious ties can be a factor, so medium.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the strongest are unemployment, drug use, and lack of education. These are high risks. The moderate factors include age, living alone, mental health, and family structure. The low factors don't add much but contribute slightly.\n\nOverall, the combination suggests a higher risk. I'd predict recidivism with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is relatively young and may be more impulsive\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues but no direct correlation here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction is less severe than a conviction\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate fewer social supports\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED and no college enrollment is a strong negative predictor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for a year is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use including cocaine is strongly associated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression symptoms may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"residential_area\", \"low\", \"Urban area may have higher crime rates but not directly predictive\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a small household is less common but not strongly predictive\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious involvement may be a risk factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
