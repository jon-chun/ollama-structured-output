    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nRace might be a consideration in some contexts, but I should focus on factors directly related to recidivism rather than race itself. So maybe low impact here.\n\nHe has been arrested once without conviction. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, so that's a medium factor.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support, which is a risk factor. That's high.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college might limit his opportunities but isn't directly a strong indicator. So low impact.\n\nHe has held four jobs in a year, showing some stability and responsibility. That's positive, so low as a protective factor.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a concern. Substance use often correlates with higher recidivism, making this high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently is good; mental health issues can contribute to crime, so low impact here.\n\nLiving in a household of five when young might indicate a chaotic environment, which is a risk factor. That's medium.\n\nBelieving God influences his life could be a protective factor, reducing recidivism. So that's low.\n\nConsidering all factors, the positives like employment and belief are present but outweighed by arrest history, living alone, and drug use. The overall risk seems moderate, so I'll predict YES with 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger adults may be at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but not directly a risk factor\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma; no direct correlation to recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Stable employment history with four jobs in a year\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use over the past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in a household of five; potential for chaotic environment\"),\n    (\"spirituality_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has influence on his life, potentially protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
