    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age is a significant factor because younger individuals are often at higher risk due to immaturity and potential lack of stability. Being Black might also be a consideration in some contexts, but I should be cautious not to stereotype; instead, it's more about systemic factors.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he was either innocent or the charges were dropped. This might indicate lower criminal propensity, but arrests themselves can still be a risk factor.\n\nHis physical stats are 6'2\" and 230 lbs. Height and weight alone don't predict crime, but they might influence interactions with others or law enforcement, perhaps affecting perceived threat levels.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which is a risk factor for recidivism because he might lack the networks to help him stay out of trouble.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently. Education is generally protective against recidivism, as it provides structure and opportunities. However, if he's struggling or not fully engaged, this might not be as strong a protective factor.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment is another positive indicator because steady work can provide income and purpose, reducing the incentive to commit crimes.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance use, especially marijuana, can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors. However, since he's not currently feeling depressed, that might mitigate some of the negative effects.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of five. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more social challenges, which can contribute to criminal behavior. Family dynamics could also play a role; living with multiple siblings might mean less individual attention or support.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can be protective, providing a sense of purpose and accountability, which might reduce recidivism risk.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n1. Age: High (young age is a strong predictor)\n2. Race: Medium (systemic factors but not direct cause)\n3. Arrests without conviction: Medium (arrests are still concerning)\n4. Height/Weight: Low (not directly predictive)\n5. Living alone: Medium (lack of support networks)\n6. Education: High (protective factor)\n7. Employment: High (positive indicator)\n8. Marijuana use: Medium (impacts judgment)\n9. Urban upbringing: High (environmental risk)\n10. Religious beliefs: Medium (protective but variable)\n\nConsidering all factors, the protective elements like education and employment are strong, while environmental and systemic risks are significant. The balance leans towards higher risk due to more medium and high factors on the negative side.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old is a key age for potential criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, though not direct cause\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions indicate possible risk\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight don't predict crime directly\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack support networks\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"high\", \"Enrollment in school is protective\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Steady jobs are positive\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can impair judgment\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"high\", \"Urban environment with family size 5\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in divine influence may offer some protection\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
