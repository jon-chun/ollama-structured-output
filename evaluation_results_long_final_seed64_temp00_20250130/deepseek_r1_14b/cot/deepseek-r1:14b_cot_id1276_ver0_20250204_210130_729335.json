    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 19-year-old Hispanic female over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. That's quite young, and younger individuals might be more impulsive or have less stability, which could contribute to higher risk. So I'd rate that as high.\n\nShe identifies herself as Hispanic. While ethnicity alone isn't a direct indicator, there might be systemic factors or community issues that could influence her risk. But this is probably a medium factor because it's not the sole determinant.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, even without a conviction. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHer weight and height don't directly relate to recidivism, so I'd say that's low.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support, which could be a slight risk factor, but it's not too significant on its own. That would be low.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, so that's medium.\n\nShe held five jobs in the past year. Job instability might indicate issues with responsibility or other factors affecting her life, which could contribute to medium risk.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism, especially if it's recent and ongoing. That's high.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps most of the time in the past month. Depression or low mood can impair decision-making and increase stress, which might contribute to medium risk.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is generally protective against recidivism, so this would be a low factor because it's positive but not necessarily strong enough on its own.\n\nLastly, she believes God has something to do with her personal events. Spiritual beliefs can provide support and reduce risk, so that's low.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: high (age), medium (ethnicity, educational attainment, drug use, mood), low (living alone, job instability, family background, spirituality). The strongest factors are age and drug use, which are both high. However, she hasn't been convicted yet, which is a positive point.\n\nI think the overall risk might be on the lower side because of her stable upbringing and spiritual beliefs, but the high factors could still push it towards higher risk. I'm not entirely sure if the prediction should be YES or NO, but given the significant factors, maybe she's at risk. Confidence would be around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"high\", \"Young age can indicate higher impulsivity and potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"hispanic_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Ethnicity may correlate with systemic factors, though not a direct indicator\"),\n    (\"single_arrest_no_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Arrest history without conviction suggests possible future issues\"),\n    (\"weight_height\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support but not significant on its own\"),\n    (\"GED_not_in_college\", \"medium\", \"Lower educational attainment can correlate with higher risk\"),\n    (\"five_jobs_past_year\", \"medium\", \"Job instability might suggest issues affecting her life\"),\n    (\"past_drug_use_marijuana_cocaine\", \"high\", \"Substance use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"recent_depression_mood\", \"medium\", \"Depression can impair decision-making and increase stress\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing_with_parents\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing generally reduces risk\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Spirituality may provide support, reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
