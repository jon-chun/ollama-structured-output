Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. Hispanic ethnicity isn't a direct indicator, so that's low. He was arrested once without conviction, which is a minor offense and shouldn't carry much weight\u2014low.\n\nHeight and weight are within average ranges; no significant issues there. Being unmarried and living alone might mean less support, but it's not a strong factor yet\u2014medium. Education-wise, he has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which could limit opportunities but isn't directly linked to recidivism\u2014low.\n\nEmployment history shows he held two jobs, indicating some stability\u2014probably low risk here. Drug use is marijuana in the past four years; while not severe, it's still a factor\u2014medium. He experienced recent depression symptoms, which can be a strong indicator of potential issues\u2014high.\n\nFamily background includes living with both parents in an urban area. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but without more info, it's medium. His view on God suggests low spiritual support, which could influence behavior\u2014low.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are recent depression and past drug use. These might lead to a moderate risk. I'll assign confidence as 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger adults may be at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity is not a direct indicator of recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests minor involvement\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"6'1\\\" and 150-174 lbs; no significant indicators from physical stats\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone may indicate less social support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma with no college enrollment; education level is not strongly predictive here\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held 2 jobs during the year; stable employment can be protective\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of marijuana use suggests some substance abuse risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Recent depressive symptoms indicate potential emotional instability\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with both biological parents; urban environments may have higher crime rates\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"No belief in God's role in personal life; low spiritual support may contribute to risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
