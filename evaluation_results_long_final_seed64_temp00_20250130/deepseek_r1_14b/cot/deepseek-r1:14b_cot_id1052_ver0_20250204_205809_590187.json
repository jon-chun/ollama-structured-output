    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity can be a factor in some studies, it's more about socioeconomic factors than race itself, so I'll consider this low unless other factors tie into it.\n\nArrested once without conviction. Arrests do matter because they indicate potential criminal behavior, but no conviction might mean the case was dismissed or he wasn't found guilty. Still, it's a moderate risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 199 lbs. Obesity can be linked to various factors like health issues or socioeconomic status, which might influence recidivism. So medium here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less support, but being unmarried is common at his age. This is a low factor unless other aspects suggest instability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a strong predictor; lower education often correlates with higher recidivism. That's a high risk factor.\n\nHeld 3 jobs in the year. Multiple jobs might indicate financial stress or instability, which can be a risk factor. So medium here.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) recently. Drug use is a significant indicator, especially if it's ongoing. This should be high.\n\nNo depression reported recently. Mental health issues are important, but absence of depression here is positive, so low.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of 5. Large family size might indicate possible socioeconomic challenges or lack of supervision, which could contribute to risk. Medium factor.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious involvement can be protective, reducing recidivism. So this is a low but positive factor.\n\nConsidering all factors: high education deficit, moderate arrest and drug use, some socioeconomic issues. The positives are religious belief and no mental health issues. Overall, the risk seems moderate to high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger adults may be at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identification alone is not a strong predictor but may correlate with socioeconomic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential criminal behavior but no definitive guilt\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"medium\", \"Obesity (199 lbs at 5'9\\\") may indicate health or socioeconomic challenges\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Unmarried and living alone; independence could be positive or negative\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No diploma/GED and not enrolled in college is a strong negative predictor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding 3 jobs may indicate financial instability or stress\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression recently, which is positive\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a large household; size may correlate with socioeconomic challenges\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role, which can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
