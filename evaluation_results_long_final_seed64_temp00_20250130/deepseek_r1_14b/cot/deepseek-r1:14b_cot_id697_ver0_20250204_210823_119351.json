    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not extremely so. However, being in their early twenties can still be a high-risk period, so that might lean towards medium.\n\nRace isn't typically a direct risk factor, but I should consider any potential systemic issues or biases, though it's usually not weighted highly on its own.\n\nSix arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator. That definitely points to a high risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so that's low.\n\nMarital status\u2014being unmarried isn't necessarily bad, but living alone might be a factor. It could mean less support, so maybe medium.\n\nEducation level: He has a GED but isn't in college. Without further education or job training, this might indicate limited opportunities, which is a moderate risk.\n\nUnemployment for the past year is significant because lack of employment can increase the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior. That's high.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is another strong indicator. Substance abuse often correlates with recidivism, so that's high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently might be a positive sign, but it doesn't negate other factors, so low.\n\nLiving situation: He lived with non-biological parents in a rural area. This could indicate a lack of stable support or supervision, which is medium risk.\n\nLastly, his religious views\u2014feeling God has nothing to do with him. Low involvement in religion can sometimes be a factor, but it's usually not as significant, so low.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high-weighted ones are number of arrests, unemployment, and drug use. These strongly suggest a higher risk. The prediction would likely be YES for recidivism, with confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not extremely so; however, it can still indicate a higher risk of recidivism compared to older individuals\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor for recidivism, though systemic issues may influence outcomes\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"6 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, significantly increasing the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried status may indicate fewer social ties, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but no college enrollment suggests limited educational attainment, which can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs held in the past year indicates unemployment, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms recently may reduce risk, but other factors still apply\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without family support in a rural area could indicate limited social networks\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in divine influence may not directly impact recidivism but could affect coping mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
