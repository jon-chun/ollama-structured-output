    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not a minor anymore. Juvenile records might be sealed, so that could help. However, being in early adulthood can still mean higher risk due to impulsive behavior.\n\nHe's male and identifies as White. Gender plays a role; males generally have higher recidivism rates. Race isn't directly a factor, but socioeconomic factors tied to race might influence outcomes.\n\nArrested once without conviction suggests he hasn't been through the court system yet, which is a positive sign. However, an arrest itself can be a risk factor as it indicates potential for misconduct.\n\nHeight and weight are average; physical size doesn't typically correlate with recidivism unless it's linked to criminal activity like fighting or drug dealing.\n\nNever married and living alone: being single might mean fewer social ties, which could be a slight risk. Living alone might reduce support systems but also means less influence from others.\n\nHigh school diploma is good; education can be protective against recidivism. Not enrolled in college might indicate he's not seeking further education, which could be a minor concern but not significant on its own.\n\nEmployed at two jobs shows responsibility and financial stability, which are strong protective factors against crime.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a concern. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to relapse into criminal behavior to sustain drug habits.\n\nNo depression reported recently suggests he's mentally stable at the moment, but mental health history could be another layer if there were issues.\n\nGrowing up in a rural area with both biological parents might indicate a stable upbringing, though rural areas sometimes have higher crime rates depending on the community. Family stability is generally protective.\n\nBelief in God can be a positive factor as it may provide moral guidance and support, reducing recidivism chances.\n\nConsidering all factors: one arrest without conviction, employment, education, stable living situation, but past drug use and young age could increase risk. The presence of strong protective factors like employment and belief in God might balance the risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"19 years old is a key age for potential recidivism as individuals are still developing impulse control and may be more susceptible to peer influences.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Males generally have higher recidivism rates compared to females, particularly in early adulthood.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests some level of risk but not as significant as a conviction history\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs indicates stability and responsibility which can be protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Possessing a high school diploma is generally associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use over the past four years may indicate ongoing substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could mean less social support and potentially higher vulnerability to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable household can be protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Having a belief in God may provide moral guidance and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
