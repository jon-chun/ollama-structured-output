    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a key factor because younger offenders are more likely to reoffend. So that's high.\n\nHe's male, and gender plays a role since males have higher recidivism rates. That's also high.\n\nRace might not be as significant here, but I'll consider it low unless there's specific data pointing otherwise.\n\nNumber of prior arrests is three, which increases the risk. High.\n\nConvictions are present, so that's another high factor because being convicted indicates a pattern.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so they're low.\n\nMarital status\u2014never married. Unmarried individuals might have higher rates, but it's not as strong as other factors, so medium.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support, which is a risk factor. Medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is linked to recidivism; low education increases risk. High.\n\nUnemployed for the past year\u2014unemployment is a significant predictor. High.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a major factor, so high.\n\nDepressed feelings recently\u2014he's reported feeling down, which can be linked to criminal behavior. Medium.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in a household of six in a rural area. Family structure might not be as strong here unless there are issues like dysfunction, but it's low.\n\nReligious beliefs\u2014doesn't see God's role. Low religious involvement is sometimes associated with higher risk, so medium.\n\nNow, considering all factors: several high and medium risks. The strongest predictors are prior arrests, convictions, unemployment, education level, and drug use. These collectively suggest a high likelihood of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old is a key age for potential recidivism as younger offenders have higher rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"males generally have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"race is not a direct predictor but may influence through systemic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"3 prior arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"having been convicted suggests a higher likelihood of future offenses\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes are not strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married may correlate with higher risk but is less significant than other factors\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"living alone could indicate lack of social support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"lack of diploma/GED and no college enrollment is a strong negative predictor\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"being unemployed for the past year is a significant indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past four years of marijuana and cocaine use are strong risk factors\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"reporting feeling down indicates possible depression, which can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"growing up with both parents in a rural household is less significant unless there were issues\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"lack of belief in God's role may indicate lower social cohesion, slightly increasing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
