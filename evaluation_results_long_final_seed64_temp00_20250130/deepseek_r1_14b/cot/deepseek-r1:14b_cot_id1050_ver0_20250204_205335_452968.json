    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not extremely so. However, younger adults are often at higher risk, so that might be a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic, and while ethnicity can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates due to systemic issues, it's not a direct indicator. So I'd rate this low.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. Conviction history is significant because it shows he has been through the system before and might be more likely to reoffend. That's a high factor.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Lack of strong social ties can increase risk, but it's not as impactful as other factors. Medium here.\n\nNo diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism because education can provide alternatives to crime. That's high.\n\nHe held five jobs in a year, which shows some instability. Employment history is important; consistent work reduces risk, so this might be low but could also indicate issues if jobs are short-term. Maybe medium.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) recently. Substance use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can impair judgment and lead to further criminal behavior. High factor here.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase the likelihood of reoffending, so that's high.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents might have some influence, but family structure alone isn't a strong predictor without other factors. Low impact.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide stability and reduce recidivism, so this is a mitigating factor. Low.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high-weighted ones are conviction history, education level, drug use, and mental health. The medium factors include age, living situation, and employment instability. The low factors are ethnicity, Hispanic identifier, family background, and spirituality.\n\nThe presence of multiple high-risk factors like prior convictions, lack of education, substance abuse, and mental health issues significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism. However, factors like employment history might slightly mitigate this risk but not enough to offset the negatives.\n\nI'm estimating a confidence level around 75% because while there are several strong indicators, some factors like age and employment could work in his favor if he stabilizes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger adults may be at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identity, which may have some correlation but not a direct indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Arrested twice and convicted once indicates past criminal behavior increasing future risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'7\\\" and 185 lbs; physical attributes not directly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate weaker social support networks, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college; low educational attainment is a strong predictor of higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held 5 jobs in the past year, indicating possible job instability which may correlate with higher risk\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine, which strongly correlates with increased recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Reported feelings of depression recently, which can be a significant factor in recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background_urban_area\", \"low\", \"Grew up in an urban area with both biological parents; family structure and environment may have some influence but not a direct indicator\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in his life, which may provide some stability but is not a strong predictor of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
