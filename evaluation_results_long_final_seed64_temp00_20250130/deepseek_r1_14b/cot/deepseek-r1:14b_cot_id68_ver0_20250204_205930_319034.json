    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly low. However, being female generally has a lower recidivism rate compared to males, so that's a mitigating factor.\n\nShe's white, and while race can be a factor in some contexts, it's more about socioeconomic factors here. She was arrested once and convicted, which is a moderate risk indicator since prior convictions do increase the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nHer living situation is alone without being married, which might mean less support, but she has held three jobs recently, indicating stability and responsibility. However, lacking a high school diploma or GED could limit her future opportunities, potentially increasing risk if she faces unemployment.\n\nShe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which are substances linked to crime. Recent drug use is concerning, especially within the last month when she felt down. Depression symptoms can impair decision-making and increase vulnerability to criminal behavior.\n\nHer background includes living with her biological mother in a household of three, suggesting possible family dysfunction or instability. Lack of religious belief might not directly impact risk but could affect coping mechanisms.\n\nConsidering all factors, moderate risks include prior conviction, drug use, unemployment, and living alone. Protective factors are female gender and recent employment. The balance leans towards higher risk due to the combination of negative influences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old is relatively young but not extremely low risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct indicator of recidivism risk, though it can correlate with socioeconomic factors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior conviction indicates some level of criminal behavior and could be predictive of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Having held 3 jobs in the past year suggests instability or difficulty maintaining consistent employment, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities but is not directly indicative of higher recidivism without other factors.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, especially within the last month, indicates potential ongoing substance abuse which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which may contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a household of size 3 suggests a potentially stable upbringing but does not directly correlate with higher recidivism risk without additional factors.\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Belief that God has nothing to do with personal events may not directly impact recidivism risk but could influence coping mechanisms.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
