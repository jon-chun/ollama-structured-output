    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 19-year-old Black female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. I remember that younger offenders are often at a higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet. But since she's just turned 19, maybe it's still manageable. So I'll consider this as medium.\n\nShe identifies herself as Black. I know there can be systemic issues affecting certain communities, but I'm not sure how much that plays into individual risk. Maybe low impact here.\n\nArrested once without conviction. Arrests are a red flag, even if no conviction. It shows she's had some legal trouble, so this should be high.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6\" and 190 lbs. I don't see how physical stats relate directly to recidivism. Maybe low or not relevant.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone might mean less support, but being single could also mean fewer responsibilities. Not sure, so medium?\n\nHigh school diploma and in a 2-year college. Education is usually protective against crime, so this should be high positive factor, maybe low risk here.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is good\u2014it provides structure. So that's a strong positive, making it low risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That's great; substance abuse is a big risk factor. High positive impact, so low risk.\n\nNot depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, so no depression is good\u2014high positive, low risk.\n\nGrew up with biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area. Family dynamics matter. Urban areas might have more challenges, but she's had stable family living. Maybe medium?\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life. Spirituality can be protective, so high positive impact\u2014low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: most factors are low or medium, except the arrest which is high. But other positives like education and employment might outweigh that. So I'm leaning towards NO for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"medium\", \"Young age can be a risk factor as individuals may have less stability\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"low\", \"Race can be a systemic issue but not directly indicative of individual risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_no_conviction\", \"high\", \"Arrest without conviction indicates potential legal involvement\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support\"),\n    (\"education_high_school_college\", \"low\", \"Positive factor suggesting stability\"),\n    (\"employment_one_job_year\", \"low\", \"Employment is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_four_years\", \"high\", \"No recent drug use reduces risk\"),\n    (\"not_depressed_month\", \"high\", \"Good mental health is protective\"),\n    (\"family_structure_urban\", \"medium\", \"Urban living and family dynamics can be challenging\"),\n    (\"spirituality_importance\", \"low\", \"Spirituality may provide support but not a strong predictor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
