    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 18-year-old female over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Juveniles are often at a higher risk because they're still developing, but since she's just turned 18, it might be a bit lower than younger teens. I'll consider this as medium.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but without more context on discrimination or past experiences, I'll rate this low.\n\nArrested twice without convictions. Arrests are significant because they indicate potential law involvement, even if no conviction. This should be high risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support, but being 18, it's common. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nGED without college enrollment. Lack of higher education can affect future opportunities, which is a risk factor. Medium here.\n\nNo jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. High risk.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major red flag for rearrest. Definitely high.\n\nNo depression reported recently, which is positive. Low impact.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in a household of 4. Stable family can be protective, so low risk.\n\nBelieves God influences her life. Spiritual beliefs might provide support but don't directly predict recidivism. Low.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the high points are two arrests and drug use. The medium factors include age, living alone, education, and unemployment. The lows are race, family background, and spirituality.\n\nOverall, the significant risks from arrests and drug use might outweigh protective factors. So, I'll predict a YES for rearrest with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; juveniles are at higher risk but may have lower than younger teens\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White; race alone is not a direct indicator without systemic context\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Two arrests without convictions indicate potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'2\\\" and 115 lbs; physical stats not directly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married; marital status alone is less predictive at this age\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone as an 18-year-old may indicate limited support networks\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"GED without college enrollment suggests potential barriers to employment\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs in the past year indicates possible economic strain and lack of structure\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a strong risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression recently; positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both biological parents in a household of 4; stable family background may be protective\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has influence; spirituality can provide support but not directly predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
