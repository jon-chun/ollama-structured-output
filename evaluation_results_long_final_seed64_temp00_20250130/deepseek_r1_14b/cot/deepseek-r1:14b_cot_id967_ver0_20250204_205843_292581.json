    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe's male, and gender plays a role with males having higher recidivism rates, so that's high.\n\nRace is White. While race can be a factor, it's more about systemic issues rather than individual risk, but I'll note it as low since other factors might outweigh this.\n\nArrest history: arrested once but no conviction. Arrests without convictions can still indicate potential for future offenses, so medium here.\n\nEducation level: high school diploma and not in college. Education is a protective factor; higher education usually reduces recidivism. So this is low.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs during the year. Stable employment is positive and associated with lower risk, making it low.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so high here.\n\nMental health: no depression symptoms recently. Positive mental health is protective, so low.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. Family stability can be protective, but living in a rural area might have its own challenges. I'll consider this as medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God's role in his life. Religious involvement is generally associated with lower recidivism, so low here.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the strongest indicators are drug use (high), male gender (high), and age (medium). The protective factors like employment and education might mitigate some risk but aren't enough to offset the high-risk factors. \n\nI'm leaning towards a prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest, with confidence around 65%. This is because substance abuse and being young and male are significant predictors, even though there are some positive aspects in his background.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; younger adults may be at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"male gender is a strong predictor of higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race, which may have systemic factors but not directly indicative of individual risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"one arrest without conviction; arrests can indicate potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"high school diploma and not currently enrolled in college; higher education is protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"held two jobs during the year; stable employment is associated with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past use of marijuana and cocaine, which are strong predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no reported depression symptoms in the past month; positive mental health is protective\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"grew up with both biological parents in a rural household; family stability can be protective but context matters\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"considers God's role in his life; religious involvement may reduce recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
