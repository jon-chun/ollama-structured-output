    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is pretty young, but not sure how that affects recidivism directly. Maybe being younger could mean higher risk because she might have less stability. But I'm not certain about this one; maybe it's low or medium.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Arrests are a strong indicator of future issues, so this should be high. Convictions also matter, but since she was only convicted once, perhaps it's still high but not the highest possible.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Body weight doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior as far as I know, so this might be low impact.\n\nMarried and living with her spouse. Marriage is often seen as a protective factor because it can provide support and stability. So this should probably be low risk here.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level can influence recidivism; higher education is usually better. Since she has a diploma, maybe medium? Or perhaps low since she's not currently in school, which might indicate less focus on education now.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism because it provides income and structure. Having a job is positive, so this should be low risk.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Drug use can be a significant factor, especially if it's recent. This might increase the likelihood of rearrest, so medium or high? I think recent drug use could be a moderate risk.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps recently, feeling nothing could cheer her up. Depression or low mood is a mental health issue that can contribute to recidivism. So this should probably be medium.\n\nLived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 6 when she was young. This might indicate a lack of stable family environment early on, which could be a risk factor. Maybe low to medium.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide support but might also lead to more rigid thinking or potential for conflict if not managed well. Not sure about this one; perhaps low impact.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: prior arrests and convictions are high, drug use is medium, mental health is medium, living situation as a child is medium, age might be low, education is low, employment is low, marriage is low, weight is low, and religion is low. \n\nThe strongest factor is her three arrests and one conviction, which likely points towards higher risk. However, she's employed, married, has a diploma, so some protective factors are present.\n\nI think the overall prediction would be \"YES\" for rearrest, but with moderate confidence because while there are significant risk factors, there are also several protective ones that might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Youth can sometimes indicate higher risk due to lack of stability, but not a strong factor here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and one conviction are significant indicators of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Body weight is not directly correlated with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marriage can provide stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma may indicate some stability but no current educational engagement\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having a job is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could be a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"early_living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-parent figures might indicate early instability\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide support but not directly indicative of risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
