    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 19-year-old Hispanic female over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. That's quite young, and younger individuals might be more impulsive or have less stability, which could contribute to higher risk. So I'd rate that as high.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions can sometimes indicate a lower risk because there was no formal conviction, but an arrest itself is still a negative factor. Maybe medium here.\n\nHer Hispanic identity might be relevant due to potential systemic issues or discrimination, which could affect her access to resources and thus her likelihood of reoffending. I'll go with high for this one.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so that's low.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might mean she lacks support networks, increasing risk a bit. Medium here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED could limit her job prospects and opportunities, which is a known risk factor. High.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having some employment history can be protective, but only holding one job might not provide enough stability. Maybe medium.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a concern because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism. High.\n\nFeeling down recently could indicate mental health issues or stress, which might make her more vulnerable to negative influences. Medium.\n\nLiving in an urban area at a young age with non-biological parents in a household of four suggests possible instability and exposure to crime. High.\n\nHer lack of religious belief might mean she doesn't have that support system, but it's not as strong a factor as others. Maybe medium.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the positives are limited, and several high-risk elements like age, education, drug use, living situation, and Hispanic identity stand out. So I'd predict YES for recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"high\", \"Young age can be a risk factor as individuals may exhibit impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"arrest_not_convicted\", \"medium\", \"Arrest without conviction indicates potential for future issues but not definitive\"),\n    (\"hispanic_identity\", \"high\", \"Potential systemic factors and discrimination could impact outcomes\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of support networks may increase risk\"),\n    (\"no_highschool Ged\", \"high\", \"Limited education affects job prospects and opportunities\"),\n    (\"held_one_job\", \"medium\", \"Some employment history but limited stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong recidivism indicator\"),\n    (\"feeling_down_depressed\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase vulnerability\"),\n    (\"urban_living_non_biological_parents\", \"high\", \"Urban environment and unstable living situation are risks\"),\n    (\"noreligiousbelief\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious support may impact coping mechanisms\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
