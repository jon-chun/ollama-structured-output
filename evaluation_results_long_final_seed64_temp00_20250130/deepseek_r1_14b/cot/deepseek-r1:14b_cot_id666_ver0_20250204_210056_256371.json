    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of this individual reoffending within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18. That's a key point because younger offenders are generally at higher risk. They might be less settled and have more impulsive behavior.\n\nHe's male, which also plays a role since statistically, men commit most crimes. But I don't know if that's a significant factor here beyond the age consideration.\n\nRace is White. I'm not sure how much race impacts recidivism rates on its own, but it might be considered in some contexts, though ideally, we focus more on other factors.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. Past convictions are a strong indicator of future offenses because they show a pattern of lawbreaking that led to consequences.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school. Education can be protective against recidivism, so this is positive but needs context\u2014like how engaged he is.\n\nNo job history in the past year. Unemployment is a risk factor because it correlates with idleness and potential for criminal activity. Without income, might turn to illegal means.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a major red flag because drugs often lead to crime to support habits or make deals.\n\nNever married and living alone. Marital status can influence behavior; being single might mean fewer responsibilities, but living alone could mean less supervision.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas have higher crime rates, which might have influenced his environment.\n\nFeels God has something to do with him personally. Religious involvement is generally a positive factor as it can deter crime through moral beliefs.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the strongest indicators are past convictions and recent drug use. His enrollment in school is a mitigating factor but might not be enough against the others. Unemployment and living alone add more risk. Age being 18 also contributes to higher susceptibility.\n\nI think the overall risk is moderate because while there are significant negative factors, there's also some positive aspects like education and religion that could help him avoid reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Age of 18 is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk as younger offenders are more likely to reoffend\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender generally has higher recidivism rates compared to females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race may not be a significant standalone factor but could interact with other variables\"),\n    (\"past_convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted once despite two arrests indicates potential for repeat offenses\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"medium\", \"Currently enrolled in school can be protective, but recent arrest suggests otherwise\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"No job history in the past year is a strong risk factor as unemployment correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) significantly increases recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married may have some protective effect but not significant here\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could mean less supervision, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in an urban area; urban environment might contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's role may provide some deterrence but not a strong mitigating factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
