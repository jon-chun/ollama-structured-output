    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not extremely so. However, younger adults are often at higher risk, so that might be a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates due to systemic issues, it's not a direct indicator. So I'd rate this low unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nArrested three times and convicted once. Conviction history is a strong indicator, so high here.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so that's low.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living situation can be a factor; unstable living might increase risk, but it's not the strongest. Medium perhaps.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level is somewhat related\u2014higher education can reduce recidivism, but without college enrollment, it's mixed. Maybe medium.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is protective, so having a job is positive, making this low risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no depression recently. Both are positive signs, so low risk here.\n\nLived with biological mother in a household of size 2. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more info, it's medium.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. Spiritual factors can sometimes play a role, but this is a personal belief and not directly linked to recidivism. So low.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high points are the conviction history and age. The protective factors like employment and no drug use help mitigate some risk. Overall, I'd predict a moderate risk, maybe around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger adults are at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identity may correlate with systemic factors but not directly predictive\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between physical attributes and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Not married; marital status can influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently not living alone may indicate instability or lack of support network\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college; education is a protective factor but limited here\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held 1 job during the year; employment is generally associated with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years; substance abuse is a significant risk factor but absent here\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not felt depressed over the past month; mental health issues can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 2; family dynamics may influence behavior\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his life; personal beliefs may not directly impact recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
