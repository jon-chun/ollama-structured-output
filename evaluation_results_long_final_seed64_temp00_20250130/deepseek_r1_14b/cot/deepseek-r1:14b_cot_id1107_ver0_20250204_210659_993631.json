    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not a minor anymore. Juvenile records might be sealed, so that could help, but being in their late teens can still mean higher risk due to impulsivity.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity isn't a direct indicator, it's important for understanding potential systemic issues or community factors, but I don't see enough info here to assign a high weight.\n\nArrested twice without convictions. Arrests are significant because they indicate behavior that got him into trouble, even if no conviction. This could still be a moderate factor as it shows some risk but not a definitive pattern.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is a strong indicator of future issues like unemployment, which can lead to crime. This should be a high-weight factor because education correlates with recidivism rates.\n\nMarried and living with spouse. Marriage is generally protective against recidivism as it provides support and accountability. So this is a low-weight factor but positive.\n\nWeight is 280 lbs at 5'8\". Obesity can relate to health issues, which might affect his ability to stay out of trouble, but I'm not sure how significant this is in risk assessment. Maybe medium if health problems could be a barrier to stability.\n\nUsed drugs (cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism as it can lead to substance-related crimes or relapse into criminal behavior. High weight here.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health issues are important, but absence of depression might lower risk, so low weight.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of 7 in an urban area. Family structure and environment matter; growing up in a large urban household could have both positive and negative influences. Maybe medium as it's not clear if the environment was supportive or chaotic.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious involvement can be protective, so this is a low-weight factor but positive.\n\nConsidering all factors: education level is high risk, drug use is high, age is moderate, others are low. The positives like marriage and religion might help, but the negatives are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; young adult with potential for impulsivity\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identification without specific cultural risk indicators\"),\n    (\"arrests_without_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests but no convictions, indicating possible risky behavior without legal consequences\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college; low educational attainment is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Held 5 jobs in the year; shows some stability but not consistent long-term commitment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent cocaine use over the past four years, which correlates with higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Married and living with spouse; marriage is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in a large household in an urban area, which can have both positive and negative influences on behavior\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role in personal events; religious involvement can be protective\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Obesity may indicate health issues that could affect stability but not directly linked to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
