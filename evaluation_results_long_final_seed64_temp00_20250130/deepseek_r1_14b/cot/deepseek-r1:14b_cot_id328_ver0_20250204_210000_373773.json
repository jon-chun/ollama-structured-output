    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not extremely so. However, being female might lower the risk since men generally have higher recidivism rates. \n\nShe has been arrested once without conviction. Arrests can be a red flag, but no conviction suggests she didn't get entangled in the justice system deeply.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime, so I'll disregard those physical stats.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not a strong one on its own. She has a high school diploma and hasn't been married, which are neutral factors in terms of recidivism.\n\nShe held three jobs, indicating stability, which is positive. No drug use in four years is a significant protective factor. However, she felt down recently, suggesting possible mental health issues that could influence behavior.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother and siblings might indicate exposure to negative influences but also family support. Her belief in God shows some resilience or coping mechanism, which can be protective.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are the arrest without conviction and recent low mood. These might moderately increase risk, but other factors like employment and no drug use mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is relatively young, which may slightly increase risk but not significantly.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential for future issues but not definitive evidence of criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Having held 3 jobs shows stability and responsibility, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is a basic level of education, neither strongly protective nor risky on its own.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates low risk for substance-related crimes.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps could indicate potential mental health issues that might influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area suggests some family support but also possible exposure to negative influences.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"high\", \"Belief in God may provide a strong moral framework and support system, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
