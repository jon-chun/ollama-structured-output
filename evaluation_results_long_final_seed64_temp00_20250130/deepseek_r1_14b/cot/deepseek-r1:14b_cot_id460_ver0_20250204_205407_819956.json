    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not a minor anymore. Younger adults are often at higher risk, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe's male and identifies as White. Gender can be a factor, with males having higher recidivism rates, so that's high. Race might influence but it's more nuanced; I'll consider it low unless there's specific data suggesting otherwise.\n\nArrested once without conviction. An arrest is significant but no conviction might mean less criminal history weight. So medium here.\n\nGED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can be a risk factor, so that's high.\n\nHe's lived with his biological mother in an urban area with 5 siblings. Family environment can impact behavior; larger families in urban areas may have more challenges, making this a high factor.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living situation is unstable, which is another medium factor.\n\nFour jobs in a year shows inconsistent work history, which might indicate instability or other issues, so that's high.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, making this high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently. Mental health status is positive here, so low impact.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life. This might indicate lack of support or coping mechanisms, which could be medium.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are drug use and education level. The arrest without conviction is also significant but not as much as others. Overall, there's a moderate risk, so I'll predict YES for recidivism with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger adults are at higher risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"males have higher recidivism rates compared to females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"no significant evidence suggesting race directly impacts recidivism in this context\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"one arrest but no conviction; arrests can indicate potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"GED and not enrolled in college may correlate with lower educational attainment, a known risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"four jobs in the past year suggests inconsistent work history, which could be linked to instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past four years of marijuana and cocaine use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no reported depression symptoms in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"high\", \"growing up in an urban household with five siblings may contribute to higher risk factors\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"not living alone and never married could indicate a lack of stability\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"personal belief about God's role may not directly correlate with recidivism but could suggest lack of support systems\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
