    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not extremely so. Younger offenders often have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties, it might be a medium risk here.\n\nNext, race isn't typically a direct factor, but I should consider any potential systemic issues. However, without more context, this might be low impact.\n\nHe has one arrest and conviction. A single conviction is significant but not as high as multiple ones. So, that's probably a medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so they're likely low.\n\nMarital status: being unmarried isn't a strong indicator. Living alone could mean less support, which might increase risk slightly, but it's still low.\n\nEducation level: he has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can be protective, but without further info, this is low.\n\nEmployment history shows he held four jobs in a year. This indicates some instability but also shows he's capable of working. It might be a medium factor because inconsistent work could relate to stress or other issues.\n\nDrug use: marijuana use in the past four years is a concern. Substance abuse often increases recidivism, so this should be high risk.\n\nMental health: no depression reported recently, which is positive. So low impact here.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. Stable family structure can be protective, making this low risk.\n\nReligious belief might provide support but isn't a strong predictor alone, so it's low.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are the single conviction and recent drug use. These are significant, pointing towards higher recidivism risk. However, other factors like employment and family background somewhat mitigate that. So overall, I'd predict YES for rearrest with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger offenders may have higher recidivism rates but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is generally not a direct risk factor for recidivism, though systemic issues can influence outcomes\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"One conviction indicates some criminal history but not extensive\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Unmarried status is neutral in terms of recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and not enrolled in college; education can be protective but not definitive\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held 4 jobs in the past year, indicating some instability or inconsistency in employment\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use over the past four years is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both biological parents in a stable rural household\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide some protective factors but are not strong predictors of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
