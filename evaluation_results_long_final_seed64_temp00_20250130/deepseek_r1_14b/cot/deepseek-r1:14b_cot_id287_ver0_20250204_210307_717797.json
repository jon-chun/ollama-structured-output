    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18. That's quite young, and younger offenders often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may lack strong support systems. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. I'm not sure how race plays into this specifically, but it might relate to systemic factors or community context. However, without more info, maybe it's low impact here.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction can be significant because it shows there was a legal finding of guilt, which might indicate a higher likelihood of repeating similar behavior. That's medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'0\" and 175-199 lbs. These stats don't directly correlate with crime unless they're extremes, so probably low impact here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less support, which might increase risk, but being single isn't a direct indicator. So maybe medium for living alone, but I'm not certain.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally protective against recidivism. Being in college suggests he's trying to better himself, so that's low risk.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment is a strong protective factor because it provides structure and income. So this should be low risk.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in past four years. Marijuana use can sometimes correlate with other crimes, especially if it's part of a criminal network or used to cope with stress. But without more context, maybe medium risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is important; no current issues here, so low impact.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Family structure can influence behavior, but growing up in an urban area might expose him to more negative influences. So perhaps medium for the environment.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be protective, providing a sense of purpose and support. That's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: several factors like age, conviction, drug use, and living situation are moderate or high risks, while education, employment, and religion are protective. The balance leans towards higher risk but not extremely so.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old is a key age for potential recidivism as individuals are still developing\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"One conviction indicates past criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of future offenses\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use may correlate with higher risk factors\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate less social support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may expose to more negative influences\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
