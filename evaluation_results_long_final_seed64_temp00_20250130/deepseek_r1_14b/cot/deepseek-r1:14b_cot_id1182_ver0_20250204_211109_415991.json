    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not extremely so. However, being younger can sometimes mean higher risk due to impulsive behavior, so maybe a medium here.\n\nRace might be a factor in some contexts, but I should avoid stereotyping and focus on other variables instead.\n\nArrests and convictions are significant. Seven arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of law violations, which is a strong high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so low here.\n\nMarital status: never married might mean less stability, but living alone could be neutral. I'll consider this as low since it's not a direct indicator.\n\nEducation level: he has a diploma but isn't in college. This is somewhat concerning but not the highest risk factor. Maybe medium.\n\nEmployment history: holding two jobs shows some responsibility, which is positive and should lower the risk. So low here.\n\nDrug use: marijuana use in recent years could be a red flag, especially if it's ongoing. High risk for this factor.\n\nMental health: no depression reported recently, so that's a plus. Low risk.\n\nFamily background: grew up in an urban area with four siblings. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family dynamics are complex. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: having faith can sometimes deter criminal behavior, which is positive. So low here.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are prior arrests/convictions and recent drug use. These high-weight factors suggest a likely recidivism. However, employment and lack of depression might mitigate some risk. Overall, I'd predict YES with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; younger individuals may have higher tendencies for impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but this is not a direct risk factor\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"7 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, but living alone may not directly correlate with higher risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may indicate limited future opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs shows some responsibility and stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use could indicate ongoing substance abuse issues\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in an urban area with a larger household, which may correlate with higher exposure to crime\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role in personal life may provide some deterrent effect\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
