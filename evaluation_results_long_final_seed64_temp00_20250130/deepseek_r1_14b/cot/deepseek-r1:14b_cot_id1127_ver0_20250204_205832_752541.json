    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not extremely so. However, younger offenders often have higher recidivism rates, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While ethnicity can be a factor in some studies, it's more about systemic issues than individual risk, so I'll consider this low unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nArrested four times and convicted once. Multiple arrests are significant predictors of future offenses, so that's high.\n\nCurrently 5'11\" and weighs between 200-224 lbs. Weight alone isn't a direct indicator, but it might relate to other factors like health or social dynamics. I'll rate this low unless more info is available.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor as there's less support, so medium here.\n\nHigh school diploma, not enrolled in college. Education level is a moderate factor; higher education can reduce recidivism, but without enrollment, it's medium.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment is protective against recidivism, so this should be low or even positive.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for rearrest, so high here.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, but absence of symptoms is positive, so low.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area. Family structure and environment matter; urban areas might have more challenges, so medium.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Spiritual beliefs can be protective, reducing recidivism, so this is a positive factor, low risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high points are multiple arrests, drug use, and possibly living alone. The positives include employment and spiritual beliefs. Overall, the risk seems moderate but leaning towards higher due to past convictions and drug issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identification may not directly correlate with risk without systemic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a history of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight alone is not a direct indicator but could relate to other factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married; marital status can influence recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems and increase risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment is moderate\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs suggests some stability but not protective enough\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently, which is positive\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in an urban area; environment can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide some protective factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
