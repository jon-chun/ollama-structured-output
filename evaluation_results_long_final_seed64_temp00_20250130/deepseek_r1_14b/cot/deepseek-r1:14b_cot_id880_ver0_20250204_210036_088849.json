    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not extremely so. Juvenile records might be sealed, but he was arrested once without conviction. That arrest could still influence behavior, so that's a medium risk.\n\nHe identifies as Black, and while race isn't a direct indicator, systemic factors can play a role. However, since there's no prior conviction, I'll consider this low impact.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is positive; education correlates with lower recidivism. So, low risk here.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, but he's employed and attending school, which are protective factors. That balances out to medium risk.\n\nEmployment history shows one job held, which is good for stability. Low risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years is a strong positive sign. Definitely low risk.\n\nMentally, he felt down recently, indicating possible stress or mental health issues. This could be a medium risk factor as mental health can influence behavior.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both parents in a rural area of size 5. Stable family structure usually reduces risk, so this is low.\n\nReligious beliefs might provide support but aren't directly predictive. Low impact here.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium, with no severe red flags. The arrest and mental health are the main concerns, but overall, recidivism seems unlikely.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"medium\", \"Age is a factor as younger individuals may be more impulsive and at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"low\", \"Race can be a systemic factor, but without a conviction, it's less impactful\"),\n    (\"single_arrest_no_conviction\", \"medium\", \"An arrest without conviction may still influence behavior and perceived risk\"),\n    (\"currently_enrolled_school\", \"low\", \"Education is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate limited social support, which could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"employed_one_job_year\", \"low\", \"Employment is a positive factor associated with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_drug_use_four_years\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use reduces the likelihood of substance-related crimes\"),\n    (\"recent_depression_symptoms\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can be a risk factor for recidivism if not managed properly\"),\n    (\"grew_up_with_both_parents_rural_household_size_5\", \"low\", \"A stable family background generally reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement is often associated with lower recidivism rates\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
