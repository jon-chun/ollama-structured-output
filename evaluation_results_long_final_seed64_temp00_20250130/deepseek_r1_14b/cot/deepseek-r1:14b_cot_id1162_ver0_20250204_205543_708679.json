    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly low. However, being female generally has a lower recidivism rate compared to males, so that's a mitigating factor.\n\nHer Hispanic identity might be relevant in some contexts, but without specific data on how ethnicity affects recidivism here, I'll consider it neutral unless other factors tie into it.\n\nShe was arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can indicate potential issues, but no conviction suggests the case didn't hold up or she wasn't charged, which is positive.\n\nHeight and weight are within average ranges; physical stats don't directly correlate with recidivism risk in this context.\n\nNever married and not living alone\u2014living situation could be a factor. Not living alone might mean more support, reducing risk, but being unmarried isn't necessarily indicative of anything here.\n\nHigh school diploma is good, indicating some level of education, which can be protective against recidivism. Not enrolled in college might mean she's focused on work or other areas, which could be positive.\n\nHaving held one job during the year shows she has employment stability, which is a strong protective factor against reoffending.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine is concerning. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to further criminal behavior.\n\nNo depression reported recently suggests lower mental health issues, which could reduce risk, but other factors might still influence her.\n\nLiving in an urban area at a young age with non-biological parents in a household of four\u2014urban environments can have higher crime rates, and living with unrelated adults might indicate a lack of strong support networks, increasing risk.\n\nHer belief that God has nothing to do with her life personally could affect her coping mechanisms or social supports, potentially increasing risk if she lacks other resources.\n\nConsidering all factors: one arrest without conviction (low), education and employment (protective), drug use (high risk), urban living (medium), and lack of strong support networks. The positive factors might balance some negatives, but the drug use is a significant concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old; lower end for potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female generally has lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identity, no specific data suggesting higher risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction may indicate some risk but not severe\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"High school diploma suggests better opportunities and lower risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Having held one job indicates stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone; may have some support but not family\"),\n    (\"urban_living\", \"medium\", \"Urban area can correlate with higher crime exposure\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Belief about God might affect coping mechanisms, but no direct link to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.
