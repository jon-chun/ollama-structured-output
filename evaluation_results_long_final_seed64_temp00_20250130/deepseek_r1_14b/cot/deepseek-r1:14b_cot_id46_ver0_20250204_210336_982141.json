    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. However, being male does increase the likelihood, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe's white, which might have some statistical implications, but I'm cautious about overemphasizing race. His arrest without conviction could mean he was a first-time offender and may not have a strong criminal history, making this a low risk.\n\nHeight and weight: He's 5'6\" and 287 lbs. Obesity can sometimes correlate with other issues like health problems or mental state, but I'm not sure how directly it affects recidivism. Maybe medium here.\n\nLiving alone without being married might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor. That's probably low to medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests limited education, which is linked to higher recidivism. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nEmployment history: He held one job during the year. Steady employment can reduce recidivism, so this is a positive but might be low since it's just one job and no further info.\n\nDrug use: No usage in four years is good, so low risk here. Mental health: Not feeling depressed recently is also positive, another low factor.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in an urban area with household size 4. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family ties could be both positive and negative. I'll consider this medium.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with his life\u2014spirituality can sometimes influence behavior, so lack thereof might be a slight risk, low.\n\nConsidering all factors, the positives like employment, no drug use, and mental health are offset by limited education and living alone. The arrest without conviction is neutral but still a point. Overall, I'm leaning towards a prediction of \"NO\" recidivism with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old; younger adults may have higher risk but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"males generally have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"white individuals may have varying risks depending on other factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"one arrest without conviction suggests potential but no proven criminal history\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"high\", \"obesity may indicate health issues or other underlying factors affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"never married and living alone could mean less social support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"lack of diploma/GED and not enrolled in college is a strong negative predictor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"held one job during the year; some stability but limited information\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in past four years is positive\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"not feeling depressed over the past month is positive\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"grew up in an urban household of size 4 with biological mother\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"lack of belief in God may not directly correlate but could indicate lack of external support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
