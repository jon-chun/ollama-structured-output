    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 18-year-old female over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18, which is young but not particularly low. However, being in early adulthood can mean higher risk due to impulsive behavior, so I'll note that as a medium factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't directly a risk factor, but it might relate to systemic issues, though in this case, without more context, it's probably low impact.\n\nArrested twice but no convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, even without convictions. This is a moderate risk because arrests are significant but lack of conviction suggests possible first-time issues.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'10\" and 190 lbs. Physical size might influence behavior or opportunities, but it's not directly a risk factor. So low impact here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less support, which is a slight concern, so medium risk for that.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a strong indicator; lower education often correlates with higher recidivism. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHeld 5 jobs in the year. Job instability might indicate issues with responsibility or stress, but it's not as direct as other factors. Medium risk here.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years. Drug use is a significant indicator of potential recidivism, especially if she continues using. High risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health status is positive here, which is good but doesn't negate other risks. Low impact.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in a rural household of 5. Family stability can be protective, so this might slightly reduce risk, making it low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life. Spiritual beliefs can provide support but don't directly predict behavior. So low impact.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high points are education level and drug use. The moderate factors include age, arrests, job instability, and living alone. Positive aspects like mental health and family background help mitigate some risks. Overall, there's a notable risk due to education and substance issues, but not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is young but can be impulsive\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race is not a direct indicator of recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest potential issues\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED is a strong negative indicator\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could be a concern\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in a stable home\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs may provide support but not directly predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
