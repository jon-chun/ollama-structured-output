    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might still be impulsive or not fully\u6210\u719f in decision-making. So that's a medium factor.\n\nNext, he's male. Statistically, men have higher recidivism rates than women, so that's another medium point.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but it's a sensitive area. I'll consider this low unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nArrested once without conviction. An arrest is a red flag, but no conviction might mean the case was dismissed or acquitted. This could be low risk here.\n\nNo drug use in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Positive indicators for mental health and substance abuse are good, so that's low.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living situation can affect support systems; being with family might reduce risk, but not sure. Maybe medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and working one job during the year. Stable employment is a positive sign, reducing risk. That's low.\n\nLived in a household of size 4 as a child. Larger families might have more challenges, but it's unclear how that affects him now. I'll consider this low.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Strong belief systems can deter crime, so that's a positive factor, making it low risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, most are either low or medium with no severe red flags. The arrest is a concern but not significant without a conviction. So overall, I'd predict he won't recidivate with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; young adults are at higher risk for impulsive behavior\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"males have generally higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may face systemic issues but not a primary factor here\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"one arrest without conviction suggests potential but no definitive outcome\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"no drug use in past four years indicates lower risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"not feeling depressed recently is positive\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married may indicate fewer responsibilities or support systems\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"not living alone could mean less stability or more influence from others\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"high school diploma and working one job shows some stability\"),\n    (\"family_size_childhood\", \"low\", \"growing up in a household of size 4 may have challenges but not directly indicative\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"strong belief in God can be a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
