Young adults are often at a higher risk because they might still be establishing themselves socially and economically. So that's a medium factor.\n\nHe's male, which generally correlates with higher recidivism rates compared to females. That's another medium.\n\nRace being White\u2014while race can be a sensitive topic, in some studies, certain groups may show different patterns, but it's not the strongest factor here. I'll consider this low.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. Previous convictions are strong indicators of future offenses, so that's high.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so they're low.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014unstable living situations can be a risk factor, but it's not as significant as others. Medium here.\n\nGED without college enrollment might indicate limited educational opportunities, which can affect employability. That's medium.\n\nEmployed for one job during the year shows some stability, so that's low.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator, so high.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently\u2014mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but absence here is positive, making it low.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both parents in an urban area. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family stability could mitigate that. So medium.\n\nSpirituality: Doesn't see God's role in his life. Lowers social support networks, which can be a risk factor. Medium.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the high points are prior convictions and drug use. The employment is positive, while others like age and living situation add some risk but aren't as strong. Overall, the positives don't outweigh the negatives enough to prevent rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old; young adults are at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"males generally have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race is not a strong predictor but considered in context\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"2 arrests and 1 conviction indicate past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes are not direct risk factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married may correlate with higher risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone could indicate lack of social support\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED without college enrollment may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"currently employed shows some stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past four years of marijuana and cocaine use is a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"grew up with both parents in an urban area\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"lack of belief in God may reduce social support\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
