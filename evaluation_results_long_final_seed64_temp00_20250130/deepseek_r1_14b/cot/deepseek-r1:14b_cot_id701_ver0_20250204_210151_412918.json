    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. Gender is female, which generally has lower recidivism rates. Race might influence but it's a sensitive area; I'll consider it low impact here.\n\nShe was arrested once without conviction. Arrests can be a factor, but no conviction might mean less severe charges or good legal representation, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nLiving alone could indicate lack of support, which is a moderate concern. Employment history shows she's held four jobs, suggesting stability and responsibility\u2014probably low risk there.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is a concern, as substance abuse often correlates with recidivism. However, it's only marijuana, so maybe medium risk for this factor.\n\nNo depression reported recently, which is positive. Family background includes living with biological parents in a rural area, size 5 household\u2014could indicate some stability but also potential challenges, so low to medium.\n\nReligious beliefs: she doesn't see God's role, which might affect her coping mechanisms, possibly low risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, the strongest indicators are past arrest and drug use. However, positive aspects like employment and no depression temper the risk. I'd predict a 'NO' for recidivism with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old is relatively young but not extremely high risk compared to younger adolescents\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race can be a sensitive factor, but in this case, it may not significantly impact recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential for future issues but could indicate a non-serious offense or good legal representation\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may suggest independence but could also indicate lack of social support, though this is not a strong predictor on its own\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being employed suggests some level of stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Holding four jobs in the past year indicates consistent work history and possibly good time management skills\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could be a risk factor, as substance use often correlates with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is a positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a rural household of size 5 may indicate some stability but could also suggest potential challenges depending on family dynamics\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of belief in God's role in personal life may not directly correlate with recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
