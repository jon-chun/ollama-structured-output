    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not extremely so. Younger offenders often have higher risks, but since he's in his early twenties, it might be a medium risk here.\n\nRace isn't typically a direct risk factor, so that's low.\n\nHe has two arrests and one conviction. Convictions are significant, so this should be high as it indicates past criminal behavior leading to punishment.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with recidivism, so low.\n\nMarital status is married and living with spouse. Stable relationships can reduce risk, making this a medium factor.\n\nEducation: High school diploma without college enrollment. Some education but no further studies might indicate moderate risk in terms of stability.\n\nEmployment: Held two jobs in the year. Steady employment is generally protective against recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Recent drug use is a strong indicator, making this high risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but absence here lowers the risk, so medium.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in an urban area with household size 5. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family stability could mitigate that. Medium risk.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God's role in his life. Religious involvement is often protective, so low risk.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the high points are prior conviction and recent drug use. Stable employment and marriage help lower the risk. Overall, there's a moderate to high chance of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger offenders may have higher recidivism rates but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race is generally not a direct risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate past criminal behavior that could predict future offenses\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Married and living with spouse suggests some stability but does not guarantee low risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may indicate limited educational attainment, a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs in the year suggests employment stability which is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"No reported depression symptoms recently, but mental health issues can contribute to recidivism if present\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both biological parents in an urban area; family stability may mitigate risk but urban environment could be a factor\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement is generally associated with lower recidivism rates\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
