Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a key factor because younger offenders are more likely to reoffend. So that's high.\n\nHe's male, and generally, men have higher recidivism rates than women, so medium here.\n\nRace being White might not be as significant in some contexts, but I should consider any potential systemic factors. Maybe low impact here.\n\nArrested three times with convictions\u2014this is a strong indicator of past behavior affecting future risk. High weight here.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate to crime, so low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support, which might increase risk. Medium.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college\u2014education can be protective, but without further education, maybe medium.\n\nEmployment history: held two jobs, which is positive as employment reduces recidivism. So low.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years\u2014substance abuse is a significant factor. High.\n\nDepression symptoms recently\u2014he feels down and nothing cheers him up. Mental health issues can increase risk. High.\n\nLarge household size early on might indicate challenges with family dynamics, possibly contributing to delinquency. Medium.\n\nReligious beliefs about God's role in his life could be protective, so low impact.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high-weight ones are arrest/conviction history, drug use, and depression. These strongly suggest higher risk. The prediction is YES for recidivism with around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old; younger offenders have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"males generally have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may not be a significant factor unless systemic issues are present\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and convictions indicate past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"physical attributes like height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone may reduce social support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma but not enrolled in college; education can be protective but limited here\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"having held 2 jobs suggests some stability and responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past four years of marijuana use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"reporting feeling down indicates potential depression, which can increase recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background_household_size\", \"medium\", \"growing up in a large household may indicate challenges or instability\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"spiritual beliefs may provide some protective factors but are less impactful\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
