    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is a low risk because younger offenders might be more impulsive but also have higher potential for rehabilitation.\n\nNext, being male slightly increases risk compared to females, so that's medium.\n\nHe identifies as White; race isn't a direct indicator here, so it's low.\n\nArrested once without conviction\u2014arrests can predict recidivism, but no conviction might mean less serious charges. That's medium.\n\nHeight and weight are average, so they don't impact risk much\u2014low.\n\nNever married and living alone: being single and alone could mean fewer support systems, which is a medium factor.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in college shows he has some education, which usually reduces recidivism\u2014so low risk here.\n\nEmployed for one job during the year indicates stability, so that's low.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in past four years: substance abuse is a significant predictor, so high risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently suggests better mental health, which is protective\u2014low.\n\nGrowing up with biological dad in an urban area of size 5: family structure and environment matter. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, so that's medium.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life: spirituality can influence behavior, but without it, maybe less support\u2014medium.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high ones are drug use and possibly living in an urban area. The arrest is a concern too. However, education and employment are positives. I'm leaning towards predicting recidivism (YES) with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old; younger age may indicate higher impulsivity but also potential for change\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"males generally have higher recidivism rates compared to females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"race is not a direct risk factor in this context\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"one arrest without conviction may indicate some level of risk but less than a conviction\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"average height and weight do not contribute to recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married and living alone may suggest fewer social supports\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"high school diploma and enrolled in college indicates some level of education which can be protective\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"currently employed suggests stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past four years marijuana use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no reported depression symptoms in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"growing up with biological dad in an urban household of size 5 may indicate exposure to higher crime environments\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"lack of belief in God's role in personal life may reduce protective factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
