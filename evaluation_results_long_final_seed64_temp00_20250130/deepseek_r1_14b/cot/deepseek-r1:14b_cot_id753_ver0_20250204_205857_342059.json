    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is quite young. Young offenders often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may not have strong support systems. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. While race isn't directly a risk factor, it can sometimes correlate with systemic issues like access to resources or discrimination, which might influence outcomes. I'll consider this low since other factors are more direct.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Previous convictions are strong indicators of future offenses, so that's high.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, but they might relate to physical presence in certain crimes. However, without specific crime type info, I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less support and higher risk, but it's a moderate factor compared to others.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED is significant because education correlates with employment opportunities and lower recidivism rates. This is medium.\n\nEmployment history shows he held one job during the year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, so this is low.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a major red flag. Substance abuse often leads to criminal behavior, making this high.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase recidivism risk, so medium here.\n\nFamily background: lived with both parents in a household of four. Stable family structure usually reduces risk, but since he's living alone now, it might not help as much. Low impact.\n\nLastly, he doesn't see God's role in his life. Spirituality can sometimes support positive behavior, but this is a low factor without more info.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high points are prior convictions and drug use, with moderate factors like age and mental health. The overall risk seems significant, so I'll predict recidivism with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"high\", \"Young age is a strong indicator of higher recidivism rates as individuals are still developing and may have weaker support systems.\"),\n    (\"race_white\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor, but it can correlate with systemic issues that might influence outcomes, though this is less impactful compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Having prior arrests and convictions significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as past criminal behavior is one of the strongest predictors of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"While height and weight can sometimes correlate with certain types of crimes, they are not direct risk factors for recidivism in this context.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which could contribute to higher recidivism rates, though it is less impactful than other factors like prior convictions or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education and not being enrolled in college can be a risk factor as it may limit employment opportunities and increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Having held one job during the year suggests some stability, which generally reduces recidivism risk, though it is less impactful than other factors like substance abuse or prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_4_years\", \"high\", \"Recent and ongoing drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior and can lead to further offenses.\"),\n    (\"mental_health_status\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down in the dumps and unable to be cheered up could indicate mental health issues, which are known to increase recidivism rates when not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"family_background_parents_household_size\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4 as a child generally indicates a stable upbringing, though this factor is less impactful given the individual's current circumstances and other risk factors.\"),\n    (\"spirituality_religion_views\", \"low\", \"The individual's views on spirituality and religion are not directly linked to recidivism rates unless there is evidence that spiritual support could mitigate risks, which is absent in this case.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
