    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not a minor anymore. Juvenile records might be sealed, so that could help, but being in their late teens can still mean higher risk due to impulsivity.\n\nRace is Black. I know there are systemic issues and biases, but legally, race itself isn't a factor unless it's part of other circumstances like socioeconomic status or community factors.\n\nArrest history: he was arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can be a sign, but without conviction, it might indicate that the charges were dropped or acquitted, which is positive.\n\nHeight and weight are average; physical stats don't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless in specific contexts like gang involvement.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Being single isn't a risk factor on its own, but living alone might mean less social support, which could be a slight concern.\n\nEducation: no diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits employment opportunities.\n\nEmployment: hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to idleness and higher chances of criminal activity, so this is a significant concern.\n\nDrug use: no usage in four years. Abstaining from drugs is positive and could reduce risk.\n\nMental health: not depressed recently. Good mental health supports better decision-making and lower recidivism.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in an urban area of five people. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family dynamics matter too. If the household was stable, it's less concerning, but without more info, it's a moderate factor.\n\nReligious views: doesn't see God's role in his life. Low religious involvement can be a risk factor as religion often provides support and structure.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Education: High (strong predictor)\n- Employment: High (directly linked to recidivism)\n- Age: Medium (some risk but not the highest)\n- Arrest history: Medium (arrest is a concern without conviction)\n- Urban background: Low (contextual but not direct)\n- Religious views: Low (influential but less so than others)\n\nConsidering all, education and employment are major red flags. Despite some positive factors like no drug use and mental health, the lack of education and job history significantly increase risk. So, prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; young adult but not a minor\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Black; race itself is not predictive but may intersect with other factors\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction; arrests can indicate potential for future offenses\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'5\\\" and 135 lbs; no direct correlation to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, living alone; not predictive of recidivism on its own\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED; low educational attainment is a strong risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"No jobs held in the past year; unemployment is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years; abstinence reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not depressed over the past month; good mental health supports lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up with biological mother in an urban household of size 5; urban environment and family dynamics may influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Does not consider God's role in his life; low religious involvement can be a risk factor but is less significant than other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
