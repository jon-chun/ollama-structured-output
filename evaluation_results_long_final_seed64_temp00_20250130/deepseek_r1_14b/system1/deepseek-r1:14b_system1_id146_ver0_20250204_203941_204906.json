    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 22 years old. That's relatively young, but age alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't typically a direct indicator of criminal behavior, so I don't see this as a significant factor here.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism. The fact that she's been convicted suggests she might have a higher risk.\n\nHer height and weight (5'7\", 135 lbs) don't seem relevant to risk assessment, so I'll set those aside.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a slight risk factor, but it's not a major one on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates, as higher education is often linked to lower crime rates. However, she's working multiple jobs, which shows responsibility and could mitigate some risk.\n\nShe's held five jobs in the past year. This indicates stability and possibly a routine that might deter criminal behavior, so this is a positive sign.\n\nShe has used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor because it can lead to substance-related crimes or relapse into criminal activity.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, but the absence of depression here might lower the risk slightly.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 3 isn't particularly indicative unless there were other family dynamics, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. This suggests she might have strong personal beliefs that could deter criminal behavior, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: She has arrests and convictions, which are major red flags. Her drug use is concerning. However, her stable employment and lack of depression slightly mitigate the risk. Considering these factors, I would lean towards high risk but not extremely so. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
