    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't typically a direct indicator of risk in most assessment tools, so I might set that aside unless there's specific context suggesting otherwise.\n\nArrested twice but no convictions. Arrests without convictions could mean she hasn't been found guilty, which is positive, but arrests themselves can sometimes indicate higher risk if they're recent or frequent. Since these are two arrests without conviction, it's a bit concerning but not definitive.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly relate to criminal behavior, so I'll ignore those stats.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a slight risk factor, but being unmarried isn't necessarily an issue unless combined with other factors.\n\nGED certificate and no college enrollment. Education level can influence recidivism; higher education is often associated with lower rates. Having a GED instead of a high school diploma might indicate some educational challenges, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nNo jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for reoffending. Lack of steady employment can lead to financial stress and potential involvement in illegal activities. This seems like a significant red flag.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a major indicator of higher recidivism rates. Both marijuana and cocaine are substances that can impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior, especially when combined with other risk factors.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health issues can be a factor, but since she's not reporting depression now, this might mitigate some risk, though past mental health history isn't mentioned here.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 as a child. Family stability is generally protective against criminal behavior. Having grown up in a stable home environment could reduce her risk, unless there were other issues within the family that aren't mentioned.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective, providing a sense of purpose and accountability, which might lower recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors pointing towards high risk are two arrests without convictions (though not severe crimes), unemployment for a year, and recent drug use. These are significant indicators. However, her stable upbringing, lack of depression, and religious beliefs could act as protective factors. \n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate to high risk because the negative factors outweigh the positives in this case. The confidence level isn't extremely high but is notable enough to consider her at risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
