    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but typically an age where individuals are still developing and might be more impulsive. Being male could be a factor since some studies show higher crime rates among males, though that's not always the case.\n\nEthnicity as Asian/Pacific Islander doesn't inherently indicate risk, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. \n\nHe's been arrested five times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes correlate with higher risk, even without convictions, because they might suggest ongoing behavior that could lead to future issues.\n\nHeight and weight are average; physical stats alone usually don't predict criminal behavior unless in specific contexts like gang activity or sports-related crimes, which doesn't seem to apply here.\n\nLiving alone at 18 might be a red flag. Lack of strong social support networks can sometimes contribute to higher risk behaviors. No marriage history is neutral but not necessarily indicative of anything negative.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which could mean he's either pursuing other avenues or facing educational challenges. Unemployment for the past year is concerning because lack of employment can increase stress and potentially lead to criminal activity as a means of income or due to idleness.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) might be a factor. While marijuana isn't typically associated with high violent crime, it could indicate substance abuse issues or other behavioral problems. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is somewhat positive but doesn't negate potential underlying issues.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in a household of two in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, and living with a parent might provide some stability, but it's not clear if the family environment is supportive or conflictual.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This lack of spiritual or religious connection might influence his behavior, possibly making him more susceptible to negative peer influences or less likely to have internalized certain moral guidelines.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests without convictions suggest possible ongoing issues but no actual crimes proven. Unemployment and drug use could be risk factors. Living alone and in an urban area adds some context. However, the lack of a conviction history might lower the risk somewhat. I'm leaning towards moderate risk rather than high because there's no criminal record, but several other factors are concerning.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
