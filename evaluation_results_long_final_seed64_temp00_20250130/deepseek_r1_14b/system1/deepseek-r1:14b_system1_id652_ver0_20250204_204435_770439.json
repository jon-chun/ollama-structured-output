    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. Hispanic ethnicity isn't inherently a risk factor, so that doesn't add much.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less clear. However, the fact that he was arrested might still be a red flag.\n\nHeight and weight are within average ranges; physical stats don't typically contribute to risk assessment unless they relate to specific crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone could mean fewer social supports, but it's not necessarily a high-risk indicator on its own. His educational background is a high school diploma without college enrollment. While education can sometimes correlate with crime rates, this alone might not be significant unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has held two jobs in the past year, which suggests stability and responsibility. This could actually be a mitigating factor against high risk because steady employment often correlates with lower criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use is noted as marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use itself isn't always indicative of higher crime propensity unless it's part of a larger pattern or associated with other factors like mental health issues. However, recent drug use could be a concern if it's linked to substance abuse problems.\n\nHe experienced feelings of depression recently, feeling down and unable to be cheered up at times in the past month. Depression can be a risk factor because it might lead to impulsive behavior or criminal activity as a coping mechanism. This is a more concerning point.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of five. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but family structure alone isn't determinative. Having lived with both parents might actually be protective, though the household size being larger could mean more variables in his upbringing.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This lack of religious or spiritual belief might not directly correlate with risk, unless it's part of a broader pattern of alienation or antisocial behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest without conviction is somewhat concerning but not definitive. Recent drug use and signs of depression are more significant factors that could increase his risk. His employment history is positive, which slightly mitigates the risk. There's no clear indication of high risk from most factors, but the mental health aspect stands out.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk rather than high. The confidence level isn't very high because while there are concerning elements like depression and past arrest, they aren't severe or multiple. So, I'd say \"NO\" for high risk with maybe 40-50% confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
