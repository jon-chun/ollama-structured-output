    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't a direct indicator, but socioeconomic factors tied to race might play a role. She has been arrested once and convicted, which is a red flag because prior convictions often correlate with higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHer living situation: she's not living alone, which could mean she has support systems in place, potentially lowering risk. But it also depends on the dynamics of her household.\n\nEducation-wise, no high school diploma or GED but enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can be protective against crime, so being in college might help, but dropping out could increase risk. She's held one job during the year, which is positive as employment is generally associated with lower recidivism.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years and some recent feelings of depression. Substance use, especially chronic, can be a risk factor. Depression might indicate underlying issues that could contribute to criminal behavior if not addressed.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of 7. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, but family stability can mitigate this. She considers God's role in her life, which suggests she has some form of spiritual support, potentially reducing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: prior conviction is significant, but other factors like education and employment are positive. The presence of depression and drug use could be concerning. Without more severe risk factors, I'm leaning towards moderate rather than high risk. So, prediction would be \"NO\" for high risk with a confidence around 60-70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
