    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22, which is relatively young but not extremely so. Younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive, but it depends on other factors too.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. I'm not sure if ethnicity alone is a significant risk factor, but it might intersect with other aspects like socioeconomic status or community factors.\n\nArrested three times and convicted once. That's concerning because prior convictions are strong indicators of potential future offenses. The fact that he was arrested multiple times suggests possible repeated misconduct.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to criminal behavior on their own, so I'll set those aside.\n\nMarital status: never married. Not being married might correlate with higher risk in some studies, but it's not a direct indicator. However, living arrangements are more telling here\u2014he's currently not living alone. Living with others could mean he has support systems or supervision, which might lower the risk, but it also depends on who he's living with.\n\nEducation: high school diploma and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates, though this isn't a direct cause. However, being employed for one job during the year is positive; steady employment can be a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used drugs in four years. That's a good sign because substance abuse often co-occurs with criminal activity. No recent drug use might reduce recidivism risk.\n\nMental health: not depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so no depression is another positive factor.\n\nFamily background: grew up with his biological mother in a household of size 2. Family stability can be protective, but I don't have information on the family's dynamics or support systems.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal events might indicate a lack of strong spiritual support, which could be a risk factor if spirituality is seen as protective in some contexts.\n\nPutting it all together: He has prior arrests and convictions, which are significant. His stable employment and no recent drug use or depression are positive. Not living alone might mean he's under some supervision or has support, but the fact that he was arrested multiple times suggests a pattern. The lack of higher education could be a factor, but his current job is steady.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because prior convictions are strong predictors, even though there are some mitigating factors like employment and no recent substance use.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
