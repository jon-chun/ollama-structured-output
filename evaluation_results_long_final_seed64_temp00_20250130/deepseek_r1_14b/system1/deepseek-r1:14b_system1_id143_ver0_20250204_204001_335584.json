    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors come into play. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't a direct indicator, but it might relate to systemic issues or socioeconomic factors. However, without more context, it's hard to assess its impact here.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can be a risk factor, especially if they're recent or unexplained. Since she hasn't been convicted, it suggests maybe the charges were dropped or dismissed, which could lower the risk somewhat.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll set that aside.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean fewer social supports, but being unmarried at 22 isn't unusual. It's neutral unless there are other factors indicating isolation issues.\n\nCompleted a Bachelor's degree and not enrolled in college now. Education is generally seen as protective against criminal behavior. Having a degree could be a positive factor reducing risk.\n\nHeld four jobs in the past year. Multiple jobs might indicate financial instability or perhaps difficulty maintaining employment, which can sometimes correlate with stressors that may lead to criminal behavior. Alternatively, it could show responsibility and adaptability.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially if there's ongoing use or dependence. Cocaine is particularly concerning as it's more associated with violent crime compared to marijuana.\n\nIn the past month, she felt down so often that nothing cheered her up. Depression or persistent sadness can be linked to criminal behavior, possibly due to substance abuse or lack of coping mechanisms. It might indicate underlying mental health issues.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with both biological parents and a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but family structure is mixed\u2014she had both parents, which is generally protective, though living in an urban area could expose her to more negative influences.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This might indicate a lack of strong religious or spiritual support, which sometimes correlates with higher risk if those are factors that help deter crime.\n\nPutting it all together: The positive factors include education and employment history, but the negatives are drug use, recent arrest, possible mental health issues, and potential socioeconomic influences from living in an urban area. Drug use is a strong indicator, as is the recent arrest without conviction, which might suggest she was involved in criminal activity despite no formal conviction.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the combination of drug use, recent arrest, and possible underlying depression. However, her education and employment could be mitigating factors. I'd estimate confidence around 70% as there are significant risk indicators but also some protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
