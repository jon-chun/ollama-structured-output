    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. Hispanic ethnicity isn't inherently risky, so that doesn't add much.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less clear. However, being arrested at all might still be a concern.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to risk assessment in this context, so I'll move on.\n\nNever married and not living alone\u2014this could mean he lacks some support systems or stability, which might increase risk factors if other issues are present.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor, but having a diploma is positive. Not being in college at 18 isn't unusual, though it depends on his plans.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior, so this might slightly reduce risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years\u2014this is positive and suggests he's not currently struggling with substance abuse, which can be a significant risk factor.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps recently, feeling nothing could cheer him up. Depression or low mood can be indicators of potential behavioral issues, including criminal behavior, so this is a concern.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in an urban area\u2014urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with both parents might provide some stability. However, it's a mixed factor.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events\u2014this might indicate a lack of strong religious or spiritual support, which could be a risk factor if such support is seen as protective.\n\nPutting this all together: There are some negative factors like being arrested once, feelings of depression, and possibly a lack of strong social supports. However, there are also positive factors like employment, high school diploma, and not using drugs recently. The arrest without conviction might weigh more on the risk side, but it's not a definitive indicator.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk rather than high. Maybe around 60-70% confidence? But I need to consider how significant each factor is in predictive models. Depression could be a stronger indicator, so perhaps bumping up the confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
