    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, 22 isn't particularly young or old in terms of criminal behavior trends, but being male does correlate with higher crime rates compared to females.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can be indicative of potential future issues, but without a conviction, it's hard to gauge the severity. However, an arrest might suggest some level of risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'9\" and 165 lbs. These stats don't directly relate to criminal behavior, so I'll set those aside.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there are fewer social ties, but not necessarily always. Living alone might mean less supervision, which could be a slight risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is a known factor; lower education can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates. However, he did complete high school, so that's somewhat mitigating.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment history is generally protective against criminal behavior. Having a steady job can reduce risk, but only holding one might not be enough if there are other factors.\n\nNo drug use in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor, so no recent use is positive. Not feeling depressed also reduces some psychological risk factors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size 4. Family structure can influence behavior; larger families might have different dynamics, but without more info, it's hard to assess the impact.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs are often protective against criminal behavior, as they provide a moral framework and support system.\n\nPutting this all together: There are some risk factors like being male, an arrest record, and lower education, but these are somewhat offset by positive aspects like employment, no drug use, religious beliefs, and living with others. The overall risk doesn't seem extremely high, so I'd say \"NO\" for high risk with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
