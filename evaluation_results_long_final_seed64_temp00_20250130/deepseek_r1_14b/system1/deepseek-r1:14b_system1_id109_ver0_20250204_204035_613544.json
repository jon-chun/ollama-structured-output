    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age is quite young, which might mean he has less life experience but could also be more impulsive. Being part of a minority group can sometimes correlate with higher risks due to systemic issues, though that's not always the case and can vary widely.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A criminal record is definitely a red flag, especially if it's a conviction. However, since it's only one arrest, maybe it's not too severe, but it still counts as a significant factor.\n\nHeight and weight are average; I don't think that plays into risk assessment much unless there's something specific about size in the context of crimes he might commit, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships can be protective factors against criminal behavior, so this might actually lower the risk a bit.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is often linked to higher crime rates because of limited opportunities. This could increase the risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment is generally a positive factor as it provides income and structure, which can deter criminal activity. So this might mitigate some of the risk from the lack of education.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That's good; substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates. His recent sobriety could be a protective factor.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps recently, feeling nothing could cheer him up sometimes. Depression or low mood can be associated with higher risk because it might impair decision-making and increase stress, potentially leading to criminal behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 8. Large family size might indicate a lack of parental supervision or higher stress, which can contribute to delinquency. This could be another risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a strong support system and reduce recidivism, but it's not always the case and depends on how he integrates these beliefs into his life.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some protective factors like being married, employed, and not using drugs recently. But there are several risk factors: young age, criminal history, lack of education, large household size, and recent depressive symptoms. The balance seems to lean towards higher risk, but it's not overwhelmingly so. I'm estimating a confidence level around 65% that he is high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
