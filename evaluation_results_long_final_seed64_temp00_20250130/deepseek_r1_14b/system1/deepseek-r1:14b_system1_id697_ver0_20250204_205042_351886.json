    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22, which is young but not a minor. Younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive, but that's just one factor.\n\nRace isn't typically a direct indicator of risk, so I'll set that aside unless other factors tie into it.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions usually indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses.\n\nConvictions are worse than arrests because they mean he was found guilty, showing a history of actually committing crimes rather than just being accused.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly relate to risk assessment unless there's something about his physical size affecting his behavior or interactions with others, but I don't see that here.\n\nMarital status: he's never been married. While marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, not being married isn't necessarily a bad sign on its own. However, living alone might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and no college enrollment. Lower educational attainment is often linked with higher crime rates, but again, it's just one piece of the puzzle. Not being enrolled in school might indicate he's not seeking further education or hasn't found stable employment.\n\nNo job history for the past year suggests unemployment, which can be a risk factor because lack of steady income and purpose may lead to criminal activity as a means of survival or recreation.\n\nDrug use: he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major red flag because it can impair judgment and increase likelihood of engaging in illegal activities.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might mean no mental health issues at the moment, but past substance abuse could still be a concern.\n\nLiving situation: he lived with non-biological parents in a rural area when young. This might indicate a lack of strong family support or supervision early on, which can contribute to delinquency.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with his personal events suggests a possible lack of religious influence or moral framework, which could be a risk factor if religion is seen as a protective element.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions, recent drug use, unemployment, no stable living situation, and early-life factors. These are strong indicators pointing towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 2, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
