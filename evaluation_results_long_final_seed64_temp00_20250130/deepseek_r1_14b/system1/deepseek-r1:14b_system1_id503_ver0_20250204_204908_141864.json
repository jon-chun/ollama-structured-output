    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. He's male, and statistically, males do commit more crimes than females, so that might be a slight concern.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a significant factor here, but it's noted. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, especially if there was no conviction, which might mean the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 230 lbs. I don't know if physical size directly correlates with criminal behavior, but it's something to consider in context of other factors.\n\nHe's living alone and hasn't been married. Living alone might mean less supervision, which could be a risk factor. No prior marriage doesn't seem to add much here.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk, but it's not a direct indicator. Employment history shows he held one job during the year, which is positive as employment can be protective against criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use can be a risk factor, especially if it's recent and frequent. However, marijuana alone might have a lower association with violent crime compared to other drugs.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, so no current mental health issues are indicated here. That's a positive sign.\n\nLiving situation: He lived with adults who aren't biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 2 in a rural area. This might indicate a lack of strong family support or supervision, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a protective factor against criminal behavior, but it's context-dependent.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some moderate risk factors like being young and male, having an arrest record, substance use, living alone, and possibly a lack of strong support systems. However, he also has positive factors like employment and religious beliefs which might mitigate some risks. The confidence level isn't extremely high because while there are several indicators, they aren't all strongly predictive on their own.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
