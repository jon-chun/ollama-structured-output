    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male, which is a demographic often associated with higher risk due to age-related factors like immaturity and potential for impulsive behavior.\n\nHe identifies as Black, and while race itself isn't a direct indicator of risk, it can be a factor in the context of systemic issues or biases within the justice system. However, I should focus on the other provided factors rather than making assumptions based on race alone.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest that the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty, which could indicate a lower risk in terms of past criminal behavior. But arrests themselves can still be a red flag for potential future offenses.\n\nHis physical stature is 6'2\" and 230 lbs. While height and weight don't directly correlate with criminality, they might influence interactions with others or law enforcement, potentially affecting risk assessments.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at his age could mean he lacks support systems, which might increase the likelihood of risky behavior. However, being unmarried isn't inherently a risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's enrolled in school currently, which is generally a positive indicator as education can be protective against criminal activity. Being engaged in education suggests he has goals and structure in his life.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Employment is another positive factor; having steady work can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior due to financial stability and purpose.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance use, especially marijuana, can sometimes be linked to criminal activity, particularly if it's part of a larger pattern or associated with other illegal activities. However, without evidence of more severe drug use or mental health issues, this might not be as significant.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment can expose individuals to higher crime rates and social challenges, which might contribute to risk factors. The size of the household (five people) could indicate a lack of parental supervision or a chaotic home environment, potentially increasing the likelihood of delinquency.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This religious belief can be both protective and situational. On one hand, it might provide a sense of purpose and deterrence from criminal behavior. On the other hand, if he feels that his actions are predestined or beyond his control, it could lead to riskier behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some positive factors like being in school and having jobs, which can mitigate risk. However, factors like multiple arrests, substance use, living alone, urban upbringing, and possible family dynamics might increase the risk. The lack of a conviction is a plus but doesn't negate the arrests. His age and the fact that he's still developing could mean higher susceptibility to engaging in risky behavior.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk assessment. He has several factors that could point either way, so I'd say there's a 60% confidence level that he might be at high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
