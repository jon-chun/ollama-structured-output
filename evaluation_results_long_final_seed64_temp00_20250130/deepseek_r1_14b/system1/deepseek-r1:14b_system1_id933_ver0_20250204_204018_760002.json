    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher crime rates among males, but that's a broad generalization.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a risk factor here; it's more about socioeconomic and environmental factors tied to race rather than the identifier itself.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can be indicative of potential issues, but without a conviction, it might suggest that charges were dropped or he was acquitted. However, an arrest could still signal some level of risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'0\" and 185 lbs. Physical size isn't directly a risk factor for criminal behavior unless it's related to certain types of crimes, but I don't see how that applies here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor if he lacks community ties. However, being 18 and single is common and not necessarily indicative of high risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment can correlate with higher crime rates because limited education often leads to fewer job opportunities and higher stress. This seems like a significant risk factor.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Having some employment history is generally positive, but only holding one job might indicate instability if it's recent or short-term. However, at 18, starting with one job isn't too concerning unless there are other issues.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not depressed recently. No substance abuse is a good sign, as drugs often correlate with criminal behavior. Not feeling depressed is also positive, though mental health can fluctuate.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of five. Growing up in a stable family environment is usually protective against delinquency. However, the size of the household might not be directly relevant unless there were issues within the home.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a strong support system and reduce risk factors by offering guidance and community. This is likely a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The key risk factors here are the lack of a high school diploma/GED, which could limit future opportunities and increase stress, and being single and living alone at 18, which might mean less support. However, he has no drug use, hasn't been depressed, and comes from a stable family background with religious beliefs, which are protective factors.\n\nI'm leaning towards moderate risk because while there are some concerning elements like education level and living situation, other aspects suggest lower risk. Maybe confidence around 60%? But I'm not entirely sure if that's accurate.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
