    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher recidivism rates among men, but that's a broad generalization.\n\nEthnicity as Asian/Pacific Islander doesn't inherently indicate risk. However, I should consider any cultural or systemic factors that might influence behavior, though there's no specific info here about that.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Arrests can be a red flag, especially if it's for a serious offense. But without knowing the nature of the crime, it's hard to assess. Conviction suggests he went through the legal system, which might indicate some level of risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll set that aside.\n\nNever married and living alone: Living alone could mean less social support, potentially increasing risk factors if he struggles with isolation. But again, it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education is generally protective against crime, as higher education can provide better opportunities and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. However, being enrolled without holding a job might indicate financial dependence or stressors that could contribute to risk.\n\nNo jobs during the year: Unemployment can be a risk factor, especially if it's leading to financial strain or idleness. But he's in college, so maybe he's focusing on education over work, which is positive.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and has experienced depression recently. Substance use, particularly marijuana, can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, though it's not always a direct link. Depression might indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to risk if left untreated.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability is generally protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence his environment.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might suggest a lack of strong religious or spiritual support, which can sometimes be a risk factor if it leads to feelings of alienation.\n\nPutting this all together: He's young, male, has a conviction, some unemployment, drug use, and possible mental health issues. On the other hand, he's in college, which is a positive indicator. The presence of past drug use and recent depression could be significant risk factors. His living situation as single might not provide strong support systems.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the combination of arrest/conviction, unemployment, substance use, and mental health indicators, despite his educational status.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
