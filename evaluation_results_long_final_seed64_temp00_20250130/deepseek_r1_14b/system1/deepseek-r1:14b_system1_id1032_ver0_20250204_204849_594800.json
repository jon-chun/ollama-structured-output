    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have less stability, but she's an adult, so that's neutral.\n\nShe identifies as mixed race. Race itself isn't a predictive factor for criminal behavior, so I'll note that as neutral.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could indicate a low risk since there's no proven guilt, but arrests themselves might still be a red flag depending on the context.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'6\" and 124 lbs. Physical stats don't correlate with criminal behavior, so neutral.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability, which is positive, suggesting lower risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can be a risk factor as it might limit employment opportunities and increase stress, but it's not definitive.\n\nNo jobs held during the year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it correlates with financial strain and potential for criminal activity to sustain oneself.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That's positive; substance abuse is often linked to higher crime rates, so this reduces risk.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps some days recently. Depression or mood disorders can be associated with higher risk, as stress and mental health issues might lead to impulsive behavior.\n\nLived in a household of size 4 when young. Family environment can influence behavior; larger families might have less supervision, but it's not a direct indicator without more context.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with her personal events. Religious involvement is sometimes linked to lower crime rates, so this could slightly increase risk if she lacks other support systems.\n\nConsidering all factors: one arrest (low), no conviction (positive), unemployment (high risk), education level (some risk), mental health issues (moderate risk). The strongest indicators are the lack of employment and possible mental health struggles. However, her marital status and no recent drug use temper that a bit. I'm leaning towards moderate risk but not extremely high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
