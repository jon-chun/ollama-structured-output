    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. He's male, and statistically, males do commit more crimes than females, so that might be a slight concern.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a significant factor here; it's more about the context of his background. He was arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less clear. However, being arrested at all might still be a risk indicator.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant unless they relate to physical altercations, which isn't indicated here. He's living alone, hasn't been married\u2014this could mean he lacks strong social support or family ties, which sometimes correlate with higher risk. But it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a GED instead of a high school diploma, which might suggest educational challenges or disengagement. Not being enrolled in college could indicate limited future prospects, potentially leading to more risky behavior. Having held two jobs is positive; it shows some responsibility and ability to maintain employment, which might lower the risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana specifically. While marijuana isn't as strongly linked to violent crime as other drugs, any drug use can be a sign of potential for substance-related offenses or impaired judgment. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health isn't a current concern.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of six. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family stability could mitigate that. The fact that he's lived with both parents might indicate a more stable upbringing, which is generally protective against criminal behavior.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious involvement can be a protective factor, as it often provides support and reduces the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some risk factors like being male, having been arrested, and using drugs. But he also has several protective factors such as stable upbringing, employment history, religious beliefs, and no current mental health issues. The arrest is a concern, but without a conviction, it's less severe. His educational status (GED) might indicate some challenges, but not necessarily high risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards moderate risk rather than high. He has both positive and negative indicators, so the confidence level isn't extremely high either way.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
