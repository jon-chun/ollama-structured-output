    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but still an adult. Younger adults can sometimes be more impulsive, so that might be a slight red flag.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a significant factor here, unless there are known biases in the data used for risk assessments, which I should consider.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. Convictions are definitely a strong indicator of higher risk because they show past criminal behavior that led to legal consequences.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly related to risk factors, but sometimes larger stature might influence interactions, though it's not a direct indicator.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a factor, but being unmarried at 19 isn't unusual.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower education levels can correlate with higher risk because of limited opportunities and potential economic strain.\n\nOnly held one job during the year. Unstable employment history might indicate issues with responsibility or financial instability, which are risk factors.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant factor, especially when combined with other issues like unemployment and past convictions.\n\nFeels down in the dumps all month. Persistent depression could impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of size 4. Family structure can influence behavior, but without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to assess.\n\nConsiders God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might indicate a lack of strong social or religious support systems, which could be a risk factor if those are protective elements.\n\nPutting this all together: past convictions, recent drug use, unemployment, depression, and lack of education all point towards higher risk. The factors that might mitigate somewhat are being young and possibly having a supportive family background, but the negatives seem to outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
