    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but still an adult. Young adults can be more impulsive, so that might be a red flag. Being male also statistically correlates with higher crime rates, though not all males are risky.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a direct indicator here, but it's noted for completeness.\n\nArrested three times and convicted once. That's concerning because prior convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that might continue. The fact that he was arrested multiple times suggests possible repeated offenses or at least problematic interactions with the law.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly relate to risk, so I'll set those aside.\n\nNever married and living alone. Lack of marital ties sometimes correlates with higher risk because there's less social support and accountability. Living alone might mean fewer people monitoring his behavior.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment can be a risk factor as it may limit opportunities and increase stress, potentially leading to criminal behavior.\n\nUnemployed for the past year. Unemployment is a significant indicator of risk because financial strain can lead to illegal activities to sustain oneself.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a major red flag. Cocaine, especially, is associated with higher crime rates due to its illegality and potential for addiction-driven crimes.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health problems can contribute to risk factors by affecting judgment and increasing stress levels.\n\nGrowing up in a household of six in a rural area. Large family size might indicate limited resources or supervision, which could have contributed to his behavior. Rural areas may also have different crime patterns, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. Lack of religious involvement can sometimes be a risk factor as religion often provides a support system and moral framework.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests, convictions, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, lack of education, living alone\u2014all these factors point towards high risk. However, some factors like age might mean he's still developing and could change, but given the current indicators, the risk seems significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
