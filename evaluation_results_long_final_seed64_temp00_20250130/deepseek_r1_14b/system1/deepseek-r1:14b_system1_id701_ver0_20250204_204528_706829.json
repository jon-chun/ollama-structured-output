    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't a direct indicator, but socioeconomic factors tied to race might play a role. However, without more context on that, it's hard to assess.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can be a risk factor, especially if they're recent or multiple. A single arrest might not be too concerning, but it's something to note.\n\nHeight and weight are within average ranges; physical stats don't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless in specific contexts like certain crimes.\n\nNever married and living alone. Marital status can sometimes be a factor\u2014unmarried individuals might have different social support networks, which could influence risk. Living alone might mean fewer external influences or support systems.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to recidivism; higher education can be protective. Not being enrolled might indicate other priorities or challenges, but it's not a direct red flag unless combined with other issues.\n\nFour jobs in the past year. Employment stability is generally seen as positive and can reduce recidivism risk. Multiple jobs might suggest financial stressors, though she's employed, which is good.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use is a significant factor. Marijuana use could indicate potential for other substance abuse or criminal activity related to drug use or distribution. However, it's less severe than harder drugs but still notable.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health is crucial; no current issues here, which is positive.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in a rural household of size 5. Family stability can be protective. Rural areas might have different crime rates and access to resources, so that's another factor to consider.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with her personal events. Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior and coping mechanisms. Lack of religious involvement isn't inherently risky but could affect support systems or decision-making processes.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some risk factors like a prior arrest, drug use, and living alone. However, she also has protective factors like employment stability, education (high school diploma), and no current mental health issues. The single arrest might not be significant enough on its own, especially if there's no conviction.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because the positive factors seem to outweigh the negatives. There's no indication of violent behavior or multiple offenses, which are often stronger predictors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",

At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
