    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher recidivism rates among men, but that's a broad generalization.\n\nRace is Black. I know that in some contexts, race can correlate with higher arrest rates due to systemic issues rather than individual risk factors. However, it's important not to conflate race with actual risk without considering other variables.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests alone don't always predict future behavior, especially if there's no conviction. But an arrest could indicate a tendency towards rule-breaking or potential for further issues.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'9\" and 185 lbs. Physical stats might not directly relate to criminal risk unless they're part of other factors like gang affiliation or physical altercations, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nLiving alone without being married could be a red flag because lack of social support can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. However, it's also common for young adults to live alone, so context matters.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests limited educational attainment, which is often linked with higher risk of criminal activity due to fewer opportunities and lower socioeconomic status.\n\nUnemployed for a year indicates potential financial strain and lack of structure, both of which can contribute to engaging in illegal activities. Unemployment rates are higher among certain groups, which might increase the temptation to commit crimes.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior. Cocaine, in particular, is associated with more severe legal issues. Recent drug use within the last month could indicate ongoing habits that might lead to further problems.\n\nFeeling down in the dumps recently shows signs of depression or low mood. Mental health issues can contribute to impulsive behavior and increased risk of criminal activity as individuals might turn to substance abuse or other risky behaviors as coping mechanisms.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in a household of size 3 in an urban area could mean exposure to environments where crime rates are higher, possibly influencing behavior through socialization or lack of positive role models. Urban settings often have higher crime rates, which can increase the likelihood of criminal involvement.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with personal events might indicate a lack of strong religious influence, which in some studies is shown to reduce criminal behavior. Without such beliefs, individuals might feel less deterred from engaging in illegal activities.\n\nPutting it all together: The individual has several risk factors\u2014unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, living alone, and limited education. These factors collectively increase the likelihood of high-risk behavior. However, the lack of a conviction and no mention of gang involvement or other criminal associations might slightly lower the risk. I'm leaning towards a moderate to high risk assessment with a confidence level around 70-80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
