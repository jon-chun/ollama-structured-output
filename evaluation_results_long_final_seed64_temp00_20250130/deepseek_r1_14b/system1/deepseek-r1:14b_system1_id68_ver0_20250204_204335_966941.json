    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't a direct indicator, but socioeconomic factors tied to race might play a role. She has been arrested once and convicted, which is a red flag because prior convictions are often linked to higher risk of reoffending.\n\nLiving alone could be a concern since lack of support networks might increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. Not having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited education, which can correlate with higher risk factors like unemployment or poverty.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year, indicating some instability. Unstable employment might point to stressors that could contribute to criminal activity. Drug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant because substance abuse often co-occurs with criminal behavior.\n\nFeeling down in the dumps recently could indicate mental health issues or stress, which might increase risk. Growing up in a household of size 3 with her biological mother doesn't immediately signal high risk unless there were other issues like family dysfunction.\n\nHer belief that God has nothing to do with her personal events suggests possible lack of strong social support or coping mechanisms, which could be a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: prior conviction, drug use, limited education, living alone, and mental health indicators. These factors collectively suggest a higher risk, but I'm not certain if they meet the threshold for \"YES.\" Maybe around 60-70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
