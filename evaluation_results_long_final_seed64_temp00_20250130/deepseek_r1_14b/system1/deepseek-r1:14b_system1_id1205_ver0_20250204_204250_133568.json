    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nHer race is Black. I know that in some contexts, there might be overrepresentation in certain areas, but it's important to consider this alongside other factors rather than standalone.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less clear. However, the fact that she was arrested at all is a point to note.\n\nLiving alone might be a risk factor because having social support can sometimes reduce recidivism. But I'm not certain how significant this is on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which could mean limited educational or employment prospects. Unemployment for the past year is another red flag as financial stress can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive, but she hasn't felt depressed recently either. Mental health issues can be a factor, so the absence might not necessarily reduce risk unless other factors are present.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother and two others\u2014urban environments sometimes have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior. But again, it's context-dependent.\n\nHer statement about God not being involved in her life suggests possible lack of strong social or religious support, which can be a risk factor if those are protective elements.\n\nPutting this all together: she has some negative factors like arrest history, unemployment, living alone, and possibly limited social supports. However, she also has no recent drug use or depression, which might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards moderate risk but not extremely high. Maybe around 60-70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
