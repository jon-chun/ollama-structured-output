    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21, which is young but not extremely so. Younger individuals can sometimes be more impulsive, but it's a common age for criminal behavior as well.\n\nEthnicity: Hispanic. I'm not sure if this directly impacts risk, but in some contexts, certain groups might have higher arrest rates, though that's often due to systemic issues rather than individual risk factors.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He's been arrested 5 times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions strongly indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a major high-risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'5\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical stats alone predict risk unless they relate to specific crimes like needing strength for certain offenses, but in this case, it's probably not relevant.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Being unmarried isn't a direct indicator, but living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could contribute to higher risk.\n\nEducation: GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can correlate with higher crime rates, though it's not a direct cause. However, having a GED instead of a diploma might indicate some level of education but perhaps limited opportunities.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job during the year. Steady employment is usually a protective factor against crime, so this might slightly lower the risk, but one job doesn't necessarily mean stable or consistent work history.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana in past four years. Drug use can be a sign of potential criminal behavior, especially if it's recent and ongoing. However, marijuana alone might not carry as much weight unless combined with other factors.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed recently. No current mental health issues reported, which is positive but doesn't negate other risk factors.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological dad in a household of 5 in an urban area. Growing up in an urban environment can have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences. Family dynamics, especially with a father present, might influence behavior, though it's complex.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God's role in his life. Religious involvement is often seen as protective against criminal behavior, so this could slightly lower the risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The strongest indicators are the multiple arrests and convictions, which significantly increase the risk. His education level and employment status might offer some mitigating factors but aren't strong enough to offset the arrest history. Other factors like ethnicity, living situation, and drug use add to the risk. Therefore, I would predict a high risk with a confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
