    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is young but not too young; being Hispanic might be relevant in some contexts, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. Arrests and convictions are significant red flags. Recidivism rates are higher among those with prior convictions, so this definitely increases risk.\n\nMarried and living with spouse\u2014this is usually a protective factor as stable relationships can deter criminal behavior. However, I shouldn't weigh this too heavily against the convictions.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level might be a bit lower than average, which could correlate with higher risk, but not necessarily a strong indicator on its own.\n\nEmployed in one job during the year\u2014steady employment is another protective factor. Employment can reduce the likelihood of criminal activity as it provides income and structure.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in past four years. Marijuana use itself might not be as strongly correlated with violent crime, but any drug use could indicate substance abuse issues which might contribute to risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month\u2014mental health is a factor, but absence of depression here doesn't add to risk.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, so that's a slight concern, but he had stable family structure growing up.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life\u2014this could be a protective factor as religious beliefs often correlate with lower criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The strongest indicators are the four arrests and convictions. While some factors like employment and marriage mitigate risk, the prior convictions are significant. Drug use adds another layer, though less so than the arrests. So overall, I'd say high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
