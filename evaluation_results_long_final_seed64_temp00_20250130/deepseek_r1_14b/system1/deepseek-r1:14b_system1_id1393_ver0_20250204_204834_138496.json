    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She's female, and gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though I'm not sure about specifics here.\n\nRace is Black. While race isn't a direct indicator, systemic issues might affect her circumstances, so that could be a factor to consider in context.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions can vary; sometimes they're dismissed or lead to plea deals, but an arrest itself might still raise some flags for risk assessment.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here unless there's a specific reason related to physical presence, which I don't think is the case.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a risk factor if she lacks social support networks.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma but isn't in college. That might indicate limited educational attainment, which can correlate with higher risks in some contexts, though it's not a direct indicator.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Multiple jobs might suggest financial instability or difficulty maintaining steady employment, which could be a risk factor if linked to potential criminal behavior driven by economic strain.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years and has experienced depression recently. Substance use is often a significant risk factor, especially when combined with mental health issues. Depression can impair decision-making and increase vulnerability to other risks.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of size 3. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but family dynamics could play a role. If the household was stable, that's positive; if not, it could contribute to risk factors.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can be both protective and potentially isolating depending on context, but I'm not sure how significant this is in risk assessment.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors seem to be the arrest (even without conviction), recent drug use, depression symptoms, and possibly limited education and employment instability. These could indicate a higher risk, especially if there's a pattern or other underlying issues. However, she hasn't been convicted, which is a positive sign.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" for high risk but with moderate confidence because while several factors are concerning, others like her living situation and past job history might mitigate some of that risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 165 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
