    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age is quite young, which might mean less life experience but could also relate to higher risk if other factors are present. His race might be relevant in some contexts, but I need to consider it carefully and ethically.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A criminal record, especially a conviction, can be a significant red flag for future behavior. However, since this is his first offense, maybe it's not as concerning as multiple convictions.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here unless there's an issue with health or size-related crimes, which doesn't apply here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support system, but being unmarried isn't inherently a risk factor on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with crime rates, but he's working, so that might mitigate some risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Having steady employment is usually a positive sign and could indicate lower risk because it provides structure and income.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That's a good sign; substance abuse often correlates with higher criminal behavior, so this absence might reduce his risk.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps for the past month. Depression or prolonged sadness can be indicators of potential issues, including criminal behavior as an outlet or due to lack of coping mechanisms.\n\nLiving in a rural area at a young age with non-biological parents in a household of size 3. Rural areas might have different crime rates, but living with other adults could provide some stability or supervision, though it's not clear here.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be both protective and sometimes linked to certain behaviors, but without more context, this is neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal conviction, which is a strong indicator. His recent stable employment and no drug use are positives. The depression could be a risk factor if not managed. Age might mean he's still developing socially. Considering these factors, the overall risk seems moderate to high, but I'm not certain enough to say it's definitely high without more info.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has not used any drugs in the past four years and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
