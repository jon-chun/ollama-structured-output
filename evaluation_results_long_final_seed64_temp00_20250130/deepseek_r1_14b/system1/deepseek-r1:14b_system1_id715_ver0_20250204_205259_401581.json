    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female, white. Age is quite young, but being 18 isn't necessarily a red flag unless other factors are present. Her race might not be directly indicative of risk, so I'll note that as neutral for now.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can be concerning, especially if they're recent or related to violent crimes. However, no convictions mean she hasn't been found guilty, which is a positive sign. But arrests themselves might still raise some flags about potential behavior.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'10\" and 190 lbs. Height and weight alone don't indicate risk unless they're part of other concerning behaviors, like substance use or health issues. I don't see a direct link here to criminal risk.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone at her age isn't unusual, but it might mean she has less support from family, which could be a factor if she's struggling socially or emotionally. However, without more context on her living situation, this is somewhat neutral.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment can correlate with higher risk factors because education is often linked to better job prospects and lower involvement in criminal activities. This could be a moderate red flag.\n\nShe's held 5 jobs in the past year. Job-hopping might indicate instability, which could be a sign of underlying issues like difficulty maintaining steady employment or financial stress. However, it's not necessarily a direct indicator of criminal behavior unless combined with other factors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Substance use is a significant risk factor, especially if she's using multiple substances. Cocaine is particularly concerning as it's associated with higher rates of crime and addiction issues. Recent drug use could indicate ongoing problems that might lead to criminal behavior.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health is crucial; however, the absence of depression doesn't negate other risk factors. She might be managing her mental health elsewhere or not exhibiting symptoms currently, but it's still something to consider alongside other factors.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a household of 5 in a rural area. Family stability can be protective, but living in a rural area might mean fewer resources or higher crime rates depending on the location. Without knowing more about her upbringing, this is somewhat neutral but could have some impact.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her personal events. Spiritual beliefs are generally not risk factors unless they're part of extremist activities, which isn't indicated here. This seems neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors pointing towards high risk are the two arrests (even without convictions), recent drug use involving cocaine and marijuana, job instability, and lack of education. These factors collectively suggest a higher likelihood of potential criminal behavior or other risky outcomes. However, there are some mitigating factors like her age and living situation, but overall, the positives outweigh the negatives in terms of risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
