    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is young but not particularly a red flag unless other factors are present. He's male, and statistically, males do commit more crimes than females, so that might be a slight indicator.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a significant factor here; it's more about socioeconomic background and other variables tied to race rather than the identity itself.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential for future offenses, especially if there was no conviction, which might suggest he wasn't charged or acquitted. However, without a conviction, it's hard to gauge his past behavior in terms of legal outcomes.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6\" and 287 lbs. Obesity could be a factor in various ways\u2014maybe related to health issues, but I'm not sure how that ties into criminal risk directly. It might affect other aspects like employment or mental health, though.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes mean less supervision and more opportunity for misconduct, but it's not a direct indicator. Being unmarried at 21 isn't unusual either.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked to higher crime rates because of limited job prospects and lower socioeconomic status. This seems like a significant risk factor.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having some employment history can be a mitigating factor, showing responsibility, but only holding one job might indicate instability or that he hasn't had multiple steady employments.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not feeling depressed recently. Substance abuse is a common factor in criminal behavior, so no recent use could lower risk. Not being depressed also removes another potential stressor that might lead to crime.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area household of size 4. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family structure and environment play roles. Growing up in a larger household might mean more complexity in upbringing, possibly less supervision or support.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might indicate a lack of strong religious influence, which sometimes correlates with lower crime rates when religion is a significant part of someone's life.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors pointing towards high risk are the arrest history (even without conviction), low educational attainment, obesity (which could relate to other issues like health or self-esteem), living alone, and urban upbringing. On the flip side, no drug use, not being depressed, having held a job, and his age might mitigate some of that risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" for high risk because factors like education level, employment history, and past arrest are strong indicators, even if he hasn't been convicted yet. The confidence isn't extremely high but significant enough to mark him as higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
