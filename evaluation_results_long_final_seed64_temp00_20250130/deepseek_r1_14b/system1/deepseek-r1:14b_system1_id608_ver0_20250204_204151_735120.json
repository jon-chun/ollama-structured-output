    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless combined with other factors. She's female, and while gender can sometimes influence recidivism rates, it's not the primary factor here.\n\nShe has been arrested three times and convicted. Arrests and convictions are significant red flags because they indicate a history of engaging in criminal behavior that led to legal consequences. The fact that she's been convicted suggests that her actions were serious enough to warrant a formal judgment, which could mean higher risk.\n\nHer living situation is alone, which might be a concern because lack of support networks can sometimes lead to relapse or continued criminal activity. However, it's not the strongest factor on its own.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment often correlates with higher recidivism rates because education is linked to better job prospects and social stability. Without education, she might struggle more to find steady employment, which can be a contributing factor to criminal behavior.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. While having multiple jobs could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining consistent employment, it doesn't necessarily point to high risk unless combined with other factors like financial strain or inability to meet obligations.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a major concern. Substance abuse is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates because drugs can impair judgment, lead to cravings that drive criminal behavior, and create dependencies that are hard to break without support.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might seem like a positive factor, but mental health issues can still play a role even if not currently manifesting. However, the absence of depression here doesn't add significant risk in this context.\n\nGrowing up with her biological mother in a household of size 3 suggests a moderate family situation. While family dynamics can influence behavior, without more specific information about abuse or dysfunction, it's less impactful on its own.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her personal events might indicate some level of coping mechanism or support, but it doesn't directly contribute to risk assessment unless it's tied to radicalization or other behavioral issues, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions, lack of education, unemployment instability, recent drug use. These factors collectively suggest a higher likelihood of recidivism. However, she hasn't shown signs of mental health issues beyond the absence of depression, and her living situation while alone isn't necessarily a strong indicator on its own.\n\nI would lean towards a \"YES\" for high risk because the combination of criminal history, lack of education, unemployment, and recent drug use are significant predictors. The confidence level is around 75% because while these factors are concerning, there's no information about her current support systems or any positive indicators that might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
