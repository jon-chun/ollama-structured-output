    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly a red flag unless other factors are present. He's male, and statistically, males do commit more crimes than females, so that might be a slight point towards higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race itself is a significant factor here; it's more about socioeconomic background or other related issues. So maybe this isn't the strongest indicator.\n\nArrested twice and convicted once. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, especially if there was a conviction, which shows he went through the legal system and was found guilty. This is definitely a significant risk factor because it shows past behavior that could be indicative of future actions.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'3\" and 190 lbs. Physical size might not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless it's related to certain types of crimes, like assault or drug dealing where physical presence can be a factor. But on its own, I don't think this is a major indicator.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less supervision and more opportunity for antisocial behavior. However, being unmarried at 22 isn't unusual, so it's probably not the strongest factor here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Education can sometimes be inversely related to criminal activity\u2014more education often correlates with lower crime rates. So this might actually be a mitigating factor against high risk.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment history is generally seen as positive because it provides structure and income, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. Having held at least one job is a good sign.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not feeling depressed recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for crime, especially violent crime. So not using drugs is a positive indicator. Similarly, not being depressed reduces the likelihood of impulsive or criminal behavior.\n\nLived with non-biological parents in an urban area when young. Growing up in an urban setting can expose individuals to higher rates of crime and negative influences. The fact that he lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents might indicate a disrupted upbringing, which could be a risk factor. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, so this could contribute.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might suggest a lack of strong religious influence, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors since religion is often a protective factor against crime.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a conviction and arrest history, which are significant. His living situation alone and past arrests could indicate potential for future issues. However, his education, employment, no drug use, and not being depressed are positive factors that mitigate some of the risk. The disrupted upbringing in an urban area adds another layer suggesting higher risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate to high risk because the negative factors (arrests, convictions, living alone, possibly unstable upbringing) outweigh the positives (education, employment, no drug use). But I'm not entirely certain if it's definitely high or just moderate. Maybe around 60-70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
