    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female. Age is a factor because younger individuals might be more impulsive or have less stability. But at 18, she's technically an adult, so that might not carry as much weight unless there are other factors indicating immaturity or lack of support.\n\nShe identifies as mixed race. Race itself isn't a direct indicator of risk, but it can sometimes correlate with systemic issues like socioeconomic status or access to resources. However, without more context on her community or environment, this might not be significant here.\n\nArrested 5 times and convicted. That's a red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of law-breaking behavior. Recidivism rates are higher among individuals with prior convictions, so this is a strong indicator of high risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to criminal risk assessment unless they relate to physical altercations or specific types of crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the same support systems in place as someone living with family or others. Lack of spousal influence could be a factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with employment opportunities and social stability. Not being enrolled in college at 18 might indicate limited future prospects, which could contribute to risk factors if she feels stuck or lacks alternatives.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is a significant factor. Without steady income, there's potential for financial strain, which can lead to criminal behavior as a means of survival or out of necessity.\n\nUsed drugs in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance use is linked to higher rates of criminal activity. Cocaine, in particular, is associated with more severe crimes and dependency issues, which could increase the risk.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health can influence behavior, but the absence of depression here doesn't necessarily negate other factors. It's possible she has other mental health issues not mentioned or that her drug use might be self-medicating.\n\nGrew up with adoptive parents in a household of 5 in a rural area. Family dynamics and environment matter. Being in a large household, especially in a rural setting, could mean limited resources, social isolation, or exposure to negative influences. Adoption might also bring complexities like attachment issues or identity struggles that aren't addressed here.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with her personal events. Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior and decision-making. A lack of belief in divine influence might reduce internal barriers against criminal behavior, but this is a more nuanced factor and less directly impactful than others.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests/convictions, recent drug use, unemployment, living alone, and a history of substance abuse are strong indicators of high risk. The other factors like age, education, and background contribute but are less significant compared to the criminal and employment aspects.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
