    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male, Hispanic. Age is quite young, which might mean more susceptibility to impulsive behavior, but it's not necessarily a red flag on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant factor because prior convictions are strong indicators of potential future offenses. Recidivism rates can be high, especially with multiple arrests.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and 200-224 lbs. I'm not sure how much this affects risk assessment unless it relates to physical altercations or victimization, but it might not be a primary factor here.\n\nUnmarried and living alone. Living alone could mean less supervision and support, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. However, being unmarried isn't inherently problematic.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence opportunities and potential for criminal activity, but having a diploma is better than not. Not being in college might indicate limited future prospects or other reasons, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment generally reduces recidivism because it provides structure and income. Two jobs suggest he's trying to maintain stability, which is positive.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) in the past four years. Drug use can correlate with criminal behavior, especially if it's recent. However, marijuana alone might not be as strong a predictor as harder drugs, but still notable.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, so no depression is a positive sign.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, but urban areas may have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. This suggests some level of religiosity or spirituality, which often correlates with lower criminal behavior as it provides a moral framework and support system.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are significant red flags. His employment is positive but might not outweigh the prior offenses. Drug use adds another layer. Age is young but not extreme. Living alone could be a risk factor if he lacks social support. The fact that he has a high school diploma isn't a negative, nor is his belief in God.\n\nI think the strongest indicators here are the multiple arrests and convictions, which typically have a strong correlation with higher recidivism rates. While other factors like employment and education mitigate some risk, the prior offenses likely outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
