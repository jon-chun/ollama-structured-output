    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but still an adult. Younger adults can sometimes be more impulsive, so that might be a slight red flag.\n\nHe identifies as Black. While race itself isn't a direct indicator of risk, systemic issues and societal factors could play a role in his circumstances, though I need to be cautious not to stereotype.\n\nArrested five times without convictions. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, even if there's no conviction. Repeat arrests might suggest ongoing issues or a tendency towards problematic behavior.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here unless they relate to physical altercations, but nothing in the info points to that.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living situation is unstable; not having a spouse could mean fewer immediate responsibilities, but not living alone might indicate he's with family or others, which could offer some support but also potential influences.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor as it may limit opportunities and increase stress from unemployment.\n\nUnemployed for the past year. Unemployment is a significant indicator of potential criminal behavior because it correlates with financial strain and lack of structure.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana). Marijuana use, especially recent, might indicate ongoing substance issues which can impair judgment and lead to riskier behaviors.\n\nNo depression reported in the last month. Mental health is important; absence of depression here might be a positive, but other mental health issues could still exist.\n\nGrew up with his biological mother in an urban area with household size 5. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and living in a large family might offer support but also exposure to negative influences.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might indicate a lack of strong religious or spiritual coping mechanisms, which could affect his decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple risk factors like arrests, unemployment, drug use, lack of education, unstable living situation, and urban upbringing suggest potential high risk. However, the absence of convictions and no reported depression might slightly lower the confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
