    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male, White. Age might be a factor since younger individuals could be more impulsive, but being in their early twenties can also mean they're still developing responsibility. Race isn't typically a direct risk factor, so I'll note that as neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests and convictions are significant red flags. Convictions indicate he's had run-ins with the law beyond just arrests, which increases his risk profile.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'2\" and 275 lbs. Physical size might influence behavior or interactions but isn't a direct indicator of criminality on its own. So, probably neutral unless it's tied to other factors like gang affiliation, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nMarried and living with spouse. Marriage can sometimes be a protective factor as it provides stability and support. However, it could also mean he has more responsibilities but might still engage in risky behavior if not managed well. I'll consider this slightly positive but not definitive.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education level is a known factor; higher education can correlate with lower recidivism rates. Not being in college at 20 isn't necessarily bad, as he's working, but limited education might be a slight negative.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Employment is generally protective against criminal behavior because it provides income and structure. Having two jobs suggests he's responsible and can manage time, which is positive.\n\nDrug use in past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism and criminal behavior. Both drugs are illegal to possess and sell, so this indicates potential ongoing issues that could lead to further legal problems.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health is crucial; absence of depression might reduce some risks but doesn't negate other factors like substance abuse.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in a household of 5 in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, and family structure can influence behavior. However, since he's lived with both parents, it might indicate some stability, though the household size is larger which could mean more complexity.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be protective, providing a sense of purpose and accountability. This might slightly reduce risk but isn't a major factor.\n\nPutting this all together: The significant factors are prior arrests/convictions, recent drug use, and employment status. While marriage and religious beliefs are positive, the criminal history and substance abuse are strong indicators of high risk. His age is somewhat neutral, as he's young but has already shown tendencies towards illegal activity.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
