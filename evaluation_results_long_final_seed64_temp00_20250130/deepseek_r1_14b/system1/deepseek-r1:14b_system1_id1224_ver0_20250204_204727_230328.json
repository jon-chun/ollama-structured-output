    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but still an adult. Being Black might be a factor in some contexts, though I know that race itself isn't a direct indicator of risk without other variables.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant red flag because prior convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to future offenses.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school but hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment or lack of steady work can sometimes correlate with higher risk, as it may limit his support system and opportunities.\n\nNo history of drug use in four years, which is positive. However, he has experienced some depression recently, feeling down for extended periods. Mental health issues can be a contributing factor to criminal behavior if not managed properly.\n\nHe's living alone, which might mean less supervision or support, potentially increasing risk. Family background includes growing up with both biological parents in a rural household of seven. Rural areas sometimes have different crime patterns, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nHe considers God's role in his life, which could indicate strong personal beliefs that might either deter or influence behavior, depending on the context.\n\nPutting this together: multiple arrests and convictions are major negatives. Mental health struggles and lack of employment add concerns. Positive factors include being in school and no recent drug use. The race factor is tricky but not definitive alone. Overall, I'm leaning towards high risk because prior convictions and current mental state are strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
