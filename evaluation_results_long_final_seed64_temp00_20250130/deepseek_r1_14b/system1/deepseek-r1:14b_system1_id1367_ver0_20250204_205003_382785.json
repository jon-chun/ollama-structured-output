    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but still an adult. Younger adults can sometimes be more impulsive, so that might be a point towards higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as Black. While race itself isn't a direct indicator of risk, systemic issues and societal factors could play a role in his background and access to resources.\n\nArrested 5 times with convictions. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of law-breaking behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal risk, but they might be relevant in other contexts like gang affiliation or physical presence, though not here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Lack of marital ties can sometimes mean fewer social supports, potentially increasing risk factors. Living alone might reduce accountability but also could mean he's independent.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment is often linked with higher involvement in criminal activities due to limited opportunities and higher likelihood of unemployment.\n\nOnly held 1 job during the year. Unstable employment history can be a risk factor as it might indicate difficulty maintaining steady income, which could lead to engaging in illegal activities for money.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance use is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior, especially if it's ongoing and recent.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior, but his lack of depression might reduce that risk factor.\n\nGrew up with biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences, which could impact his behavior.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a strong belief system, which might provide internal controls but could also influence behavior in ways that are rigid or lead to externalizing blame.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests/convictions, drug use, lack of education and stable employment, urban upbringing\u2014all these factors point towards high risk. The positive aspects like no depression and a belief system might slightly mitigate but don't outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
