    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. Being male might be relevant since some studies show higher recidivism rates among men, but that's a generalization and can vary widely.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race itself isn't a direct indicator, but socioeconomic factors tied to race could play a role. He has been arrested once and convicted, which is a red flag because prior convictions are often linked to higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I can probably ignore those. He's never married and lives alone; living alone might mean less social support, potentially increasing risk, but it's not a strong factor on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can be a factor\u2014lower education sometimes correlates with higher crime rates, but again, this is just one piece of the puzzle. He's held four jobs in a year, which shows some stability and responsibility, possibly lowering risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) could indicate substance abuse issues, which often co-occur with criminal behavior. However, marijuana use alone might not be as strong a predictor unless combined with other factors like prior convictions.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, so no current mental health issues are apparent. Early life details: grew up with both biological parents in a rural household of four. Stable family structure can sometimes reduce risk, but rural areas may have different crime patterns or access to resources.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life, which might indicate strong personal beliefs that could deter him from criminal behavior, though this isn't always the case and varies by individual.\n\nPutting it all together: prior conviction is significant. The other factors like education, employment, and living situation are somewhat neutral or slightly mitigating but not enough to outweigh the conviction. Drug use adds some risk, but without more severe mental health issues or a pattern of substance abuse beyond marijuana, it's moderate.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because the prior conviction is a strong indicator, even if other factors aren't strongly positive or negative. However, I'm not entirely certain, so confidence isn't too high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
