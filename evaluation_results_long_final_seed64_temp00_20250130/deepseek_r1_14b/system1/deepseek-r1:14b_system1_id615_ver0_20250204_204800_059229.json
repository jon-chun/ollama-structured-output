    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male, White. Age-wise, 21 isn't too young or old in terms of criminal behavior, but it's still early adulthood. His race might be a factor depending on the context, but I don't have enough info on that here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, especially if there were convictions. The fact that he was convicted suggests some level of criminal behavior that went through the legal system.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'0\" and 165 lbs. I don't think physical stats directly correlate with risk unless they're extremes, so probably not a big factor here.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less support or supervision, which could be a risk factor if he lacks social ties to keep him in check.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. A GED instead of a high school diploma might indicate some educational challenges or gaps. Not being in college could mean limited future prospects or engagement in other activities.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Having steady employment can be protective, but only holding one job might not provide enough income stability or social connections if that job is lost.\n\nDrug use in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism and criminal behavior. Both drugs are illegal in many places, so this could indicate ongoing issues.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health can be a factor, but since he's not showing signs of depression now, that might lower the risk slightly.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban setting can have its challenges, like higher crime rates, but having both parents around might provide some stability. However, if there were issues at home, it could contribute to his behavior.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might indicate a lack of strong religious or spiritual support, which sometimes acts as a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of arrests and convictions, uses drugs, lives alone, hasn't completed higher education, and lacks certain protective factors like strong social ties or religious beliefs. These are moderate to high risk indicators. However, he's employed and doesn't show signs of depression currently, which might slightly lower the risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a \"YES\" for high risk because his criminal history and drug use are significant, but I'm not entirely certain without more context on other factors like family support or community involvement.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
