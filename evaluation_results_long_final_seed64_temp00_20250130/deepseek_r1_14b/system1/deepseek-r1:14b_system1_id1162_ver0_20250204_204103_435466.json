    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female Hispanic. Age is quite young, which might mean less criminal history but could also indicate immaturity. Being Hispanic might be relevant in some contexts, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can sometimes correlate with higher risk, even if there's no conviction, as they might indicate a tendency towards problematic behavior.\n\nHeight and weight are within average ranges; I don't think these factors contribute much unless there's something specific about them in the dataset.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living alone could be a risk factor because it might mean less supervision or support. Not living alone might reduce that risk, but being unmarried at 20 isn't necessarily a red flag on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education is often associated with lower recidivism rates. However, not being in college doesn't automatically mean she's at high risk unless other factors point towards it.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment history is generally positive because steady work can indicate stability and responsibility. One job might be okay, but if there were multiple jobs or gaps, that could be more concerning.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Cocaine especially is often linked with higher criminal tendencies compared to marijuana alone.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health can play a role; absence of depression might lower her risk, but other factors could still be at play.\n\nLived with non-biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban environment and being raised by adults who aren't biological parents might indicate a lack of strong support systems or exposure to negative influences, which can contribute to higher risk.\n\nFeels God has nothing to do with her personal events. This might suggest a lack of strong social or religious support networks, which could be protective factors against criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors here are the arrest (even without conviction), recent drug use (especially cocaine), and possibly the living situation and perceived lack of external support. These points might indicate a higher risk. However, she's employed, has a diploma, and isn't showing signs of depression, which could mitigate some of that risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" for high risk because drug use is a strong indicator, but I'm not entirely certain without more context on how these factors weigh in the model.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
