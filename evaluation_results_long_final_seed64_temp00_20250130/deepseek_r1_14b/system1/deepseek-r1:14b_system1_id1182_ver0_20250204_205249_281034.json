    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age might be relevant because younger individuals could have less stability, but being 21 isn't extremely young. His race might not directly indicate risk unless there are systemic issues, which I'm not considering here specifically.\n\nHe has been arrested 7 times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions usually correlate with higher recidivism rates. So this is a major point towards high risk.\n\nHe stands at 5'7\" and weighs 142 lbs. Physical stats don't typically predict criminal behavior, so I might not give much weight to this unless there's an underlying issue like health problems, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk factors, but it's not a direct indicator. Being unmarried at 21 isn't unusual either.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can be a factor; lower education might correlate with higher crime rates, but he did finish high school, so that's some stability.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having steady employment is generally a positive indicator, suggesting responsibility and possibly lower risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent use, can be linked to criminal behavior, though it depends on the context. Marijuana isn't as severe as other drugs but still a concern.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health is important; no current issues here, which is good.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household of 5. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, and larger households might indicate a chaotic environment, contributing to risk factors.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his personal events. This could be a positive factor indicating some form of coping mechanism or support system, but it's not clear how significant this is.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators. His employment history is positive, education is okay, drug use is recent but not severe, living alone isn't too concerning, and no mental health issues. The urban upbringing might add some risk, but the key factor here is the 7 arrests and convictions.\n\nI think he's at high risk because past behavior is a strong predictor of future behavior, especially with multiple convictions. However, his current employment and education slightly mitigate that risk. So I'd say \"YES\" for high risk with maybe around 65-70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
