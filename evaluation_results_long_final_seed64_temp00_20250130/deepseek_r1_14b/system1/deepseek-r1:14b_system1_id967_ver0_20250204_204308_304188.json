    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have less stability and more impulsive behavior. But 19 isn't extremely young; some might argue it's still quite impressionable.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race is a significant factor here unless there are known biases in the data used for risk assessments, which I should be cautious about.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can indicate potential issues, but without a conviction, it might suggest that the case didn't lead to charges or was dismissed. However, an arrest itself could still raise some flags regarding behavior.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'8\" and 140 lbs. I don't see how physical stats directly correlate with criminal risk unless there's a specific context, like needing strength for certain crimes, but that seems too situational to consider generally.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone might mean less support system, which could be a risk factor if he lacks social ties to keep him in check. But being single and young isn't inherently bad.\n\nHigh school diploma, not enrolled in college. Education can sometimes be linked to lower recidivism rates, but not having higher education doesn't necessarily mean high risk unless combined with other factors like unemployment.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs during the year. Employment is generally a positive indicator as it shows responsibility and provides structure. Having two jobs might indicate he's trying hard, which could be protective against criminal behavior.\n\nUsed drugs in past four years: marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can be a red flag, especially if it's recent and includes substances like cocaine, which are more associated with higher risk behaviors. However, without knowing the frequency or context, it's a bit tricky.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is important; no current depression might reduce some risk factors, but other mental health issues could still be present that aren't mentioned here.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of 4 in a rural area. Family stability can be protective. Growing up in a rural area might have different dynamics compared to urban settings, possibly less exposure to certain types of crime, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can provide a strong support system and reduce risk factors by offering guidance and accountability.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some positive indicators like employment, education, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs. Negative factors include an arrest, recent drug use, living alone, and being young. The arrest is concerning but without a conviction, it's less severe. Drug use is significant, especially cocaine, which can be linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\nI'm leaning towards moderate risk because while there are some red flags, there are also protective factors that might mitigate his likelihood of reoffending or engaging in criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
