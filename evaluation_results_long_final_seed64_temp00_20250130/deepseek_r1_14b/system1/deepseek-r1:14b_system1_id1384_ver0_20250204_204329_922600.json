    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not particularly indicative of high risk unless other factors are present. She identifies as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut; I don't know if that correlates with higher risk in this context, so maybe neutral there.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but no convictions. Arrests can be a red flag, but without convictions, it's less clear. However, arrests might still indicate potential for future issues.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests possible educational challenges, which could impact her stability and opportunities, potentially increasing risk factors.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse\u2014marriage can sometimes be protective, but if there are issues within the marriage, it might not be as positive. Not enough info here to assess that.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant unless they relate to health issues, which aren't mentioned.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant concern. Substance use can indicate both current issues and potential for future legal or personal problems.\n\nShe has felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health struggles can contribute to higher risk if not managed.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 3 in a rural area\u2014rural areas might have different access to resources, which could impact her circumstances but isn't directly a risk factor.\n\nBelief that God has something to do with personal events is more about worldview and spirituality. Not sure how this affects risk assessment unless it's tied to coping mechanisms or support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: The key factors are the arrests (even without convictions), drug use, lack of education, unemployment beyond one job in a year, and recent depressive symptoms. These points suggest moderate to high risk. However, her marriage might be protective, but not enough to outweigh other negatives. I'm leaning towards high risk with maybe 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
