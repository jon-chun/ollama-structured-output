    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 22. That's relatively young, but not extremely so. People in their early twenties are still developing and can be impulsive, which might contribute to higher risk.\n\nRace isn't typically a factor in risk assessment, so I'll set that aside unless other info suggests otherwise.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Arrests and convictions are definitely red flags. A conviction indicates he's been through the legal system, which could mean a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'11\" and 225-249 lbs. That's on the heavier side, but I'm not sure how much that directly impacts risk. Maybe it relates to physical presence or other factors, but without more context, it might not be a major indicator.\n\nMarital status: never married, living with others now. Not being married could mean less stability, but he's not alone, which might provide some support system, possibly lowering risk.\n\nEducation: GED and not in college. A GED can indicate lower educational attainment, which is often linked to higher risk factors like unemployment or involvement in crime.\n\nEmployment: held one job during the year. Having a job is generally protective, but only holding one suggests he's been employed consistently, which might be positive. However, if that job is unstable or low-paying, it could still pose risks.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is concerning because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior and other risky actions.\n\nMental health: no depression symptoms in the past month. That's a good sign; mental health issues often increase risk if untreated.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area, household size 4. Growing up in an urban area might expose him to more crime or negative influences, but having stable family support could mitigate that.\n\nSpirituality: believes God has a role in his life. Spirituality can sometimes be protective, providing a sense of purpose and reducing risky behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal history, which is a strong indicator. His education level might limit opportunities, and recent drug use adds to the risk. However, having a job and living with others could lower the risk somewhat. I'm leaning towards high risk because the arrest/conviction and drug use are significant factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
