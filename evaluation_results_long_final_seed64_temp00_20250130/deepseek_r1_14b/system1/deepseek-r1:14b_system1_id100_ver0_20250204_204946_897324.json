    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is 19 years old. That's a young age, but it's also a time when individuals are still developing and can be more impulsive. However, age alone isn't a definitive indicator of risk.\n\nHe identifies as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. I'm not sure if there's any specific data linking this ethnic group to higher criminal recidivism rates, but it might be worth considering if there are systemic issues affecting this community that could influence his behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested 9 times and convicted each time. That's a significant number of arrests and convictions. A high number of prior offenses is often a strong indicator of potential future offending. Recidivism rates can vary, but multiple convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\nHeight and weight (5'9\", 180 lbs) don't seem relevant to risk assessment unless there's specific data linking body type to crime, which I'm not aware of. So probably not a factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Lack of marital ties can sometimes be associated with higher risk because there are fewer social bonds holding him back from criminal behavior. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky activities.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked to higher crime rates. Without a diploma, it can be harder to find stable employment, which ties into the next point.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is another strong indicator of potential criminal activity. Financial stress and lack of legitimate income sources can push individuals towards illegal activities as a means of livelihood.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana). Marijuana use itself might not be directly linked to violent crime, but substance abuse can impair judgment and increase involvement in other crimes or risky behaviors. However, it's important to note that correlation doesn't imply causation here.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health is a factor; however, the absence of depression might reduce risk, but other mental health issues could still be present and unreported.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 8 at a young age. Large family households can sometimes contribute to higher delinquency rates due to overcrowding, lack of parental supervision, or exposure to negative influences. However, this depends on the specific dynamics within the household.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a strong belief system, which could either deter him from criminal behavior (if he fears divine retribution) or might not have any impact if his perception is more fatalistic. The influence of religion on behavior can be complex and varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions are significant red flags. Lack of education and employment, along with living alone, suggest limited social support and potential financial strain. Drug use adds another layer of risk, even if it's marijuana. His belief system might offer some deterrence but isn't a guaranteed protective factor. The household size could be a contributing factor from his past.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high number of prior convictions stands out as a major indicator of high risk. While other factors like unemployment and lack of education support this assessment, the drug use is less directly concerning compared to harder drugs or more severe offenses. His age might slightly mitigate the risk, but given the multiple convictions, it's still leaning towards high risk.\n\nI would rate the confidence at around 75%. There are several strong indicators pointing towards high risk, but some factors like his belief in God and possible mitigating circumstances not mentioned could lower the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
