    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this recidivism prediction step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and try to think through each factor carefully.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old White male. He has been arrested once and convicted. That's one strike against him in terms of prior criminal history. From the examples given, prior arrests seem significant because several cases with multiple arrests or convictions led to \"YES\" outcomes. So, I'll note that as a medium factor.\n\nNext, his weight is between 225-249 lbs. Obesity can sometimes be linked to various factors like health issues or socioeconomic status, but in the context of recidivism, it might not have a direct correlation unless it affects employment or mental health. Looking at previous examples, I don't recall weight being a major factor, so maybe this is low.\n\nHe's not married and currently doesn't live alone. Not being married can sometimes mean fewer social ties to keep him out of trouble, but living with others might provide some support. In the examples, both single and non-single individuals had varying outcomes, so I'm leaning towards a medium weight here because it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education can be a factor; higher education is often linked to lower recidivism rates. However, having a GED might indicate some level of educational attainment, but not as strong as a high school diploma or further education. I'll give this a low weight.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Employment stability is important because steady work can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Having just one job might mean he's either very stable or perhaps hasn't had many opportunities, but it doesn't indicate instability like multiple jobs lost would. So, I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential recidivism because drug use can lead to relapse into criminal behavior to support the habit or commit crimes related to drug acquisition. In previous examples, drug use often led to \"YES\" outcomes, so this should be high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but without a history of depression or other mental illnesses, this might not be as impactful. However, substance abuse can sometimes mask underlying mental health problems, so I'll give this a low weight since there's no reported issue currently.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area when young. Family stability is generally protective against recidivism, but living in an urban area could mean higher exposure to crime and negative influences. In the examples, family structure was sometimes considered, but it's mixed. I'll assign a low weight here because it's a bit of a double-edged factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him. Spiritual beliefs can be both positive (providing support) and potentially isolating if someone feels they have no control over their fate. In the examples, this belief didn't seem to strongly influence outcomes either way, so I'll consider it low.\n\nNow, compiling all these factors:\n\n- Prior arrest/conviction: Medium\n- Weight: Low\n- Living situation: Medium\n- Education: Low\n- Employment: Medium\n- Drug use: High\n- Mental health: Low\n- Family background: Low\n- Spirituality: Low\n\nThe strongest factor here is the recent drug use, which I've weighted as high. Prior arrest and employment are medium, while others are low. Considering that in previous examples, multiple risk factors often led to \"YES,\" especially when drug use was present, I'm leaning towards a prediction of \"YES.\" My confidence isn't too high because some factors like living with parents and spirituality might offer protective effects, but the combination of prior conviction and ongoing drug use is significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicate past criminal behavior, a known risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"weight_obesity\", \"low\", \"While obesity may have social or health implications, it's not directly linked to recidivism in the examples provided\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone might provide some support but could also indicate instability; a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_GED\", \"low\", \"A GED shows basic educational attainment but is less protective than higher education\"),\n    (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job suggests minimal stability, though not strongly indicative of recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse_drugs\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health_depressed\", \"low\", \"No reported depression, but substance abuse may mask underlying issues\"),\n    (\"family_background_urban\", \"low\", \"Mixed impact from urban living; family stability can be protective\"),\n    (\"spirituality_belief\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs' influence on recidivism is unclear and varied in examples\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.7\n}\n```",
