    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 21-year-old White female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 19 or 20 had varying outcomes, but age alone doesn't seem to be a strong indicator here. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In previous cases, first-time arrests without convictions sometimes led to \"NO\" predictions, especially if other factors are favorable. This might be a medium factor because it indicates some risk but isn't definitive.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so I'll skip that.\n\nShe's never married, which in the examples didn't strongly correlate with outcomes. So low impact here.\n\nLiving alone: In some cases, living alone was associated with higher risk, but others didn't show a strong trend. Maybe medium because it could indicate less support, but not certain.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education generally reduces recidivism, so this should be a high positive factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor for rearrest. In examples, unemployment often led to higher recidivism rates, so this might be medium or high. Since she's in college, maybe it's less impactful, but still significant.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism, especially for nonviolent crimes related to drug use. This should be a high factor.\n\nNo depression reported recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, so no issues here make this low impact.\n\nFamily background: She lived with her biological mother in an urban area with household size 2. Family stability can vary; some examples showed that growing up in urban areas with less stable households might contribute to higher risk. This could be medium because it's somewhat concerning but not the strongest factor.\n\nBelieves God influences her life: In examples, this belief sometimes led to \"NO\" predictions as it might indicate strong moral support. So this is a high positive factor.\n\nNow, considering all factors, drug use and education are high, arrest history and living alone are medium, others low. The presence of strong risk factors like drug use could outweigh positives like education and religion. However, she's in college and hasn't been convicted yet. It's a bit conflicting, but the drug use might be more influential.\n\nI think the prediction is \"YES\" with about 60% confidence because while there are positive factors, the drug use is a significant red flag.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age of 21 is not strongly indicative in examples\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests some risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in college and has diploma, positive factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs may indicate potential instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong recidivism indicator\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might suggest less support\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with mother, mixed impact\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"high\", \"Believes in God's influence, positive factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
