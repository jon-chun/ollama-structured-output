    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not particularly high risk compared to younger teens. However, being in their late teens can still be a factor as they might be more impulsive.\n\nArrest history: He's been arrested twice and convicted once. In the examples provided, prior arrests were significant factors. For instance, Example 1 had two arrests and was predicted YES. So this is a medium to high risk factor.\n\nConviction history: Having a conviction increases the likelihood of rearrest. Examples like #27 and #30 show that convictions matter, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nRace: White. In the examples, race didn't seem to be a direct factor unless other variables were present. So maybe low impact here.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'0\" and 230 lbs. Obesity can sometimes relate to health issues but not directly to recidivism. Maybe low impact.\n\nMarital status: Single, living alone. Not married might mean less stability, but in examples, living alone didn't always predict rearrest. So perhaps medium? Or maybe low since it's more about personal circumstances than direct risk factors.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and not enrolled. In the examples, lack of education was a factor in some cases leading to higher recidivism. For example, #27 had a GED but still rearrested. So this is probably medium.\n\nEmployment: Held one job during the year. Employment can be protective, but having only held one might indicate instability or recent employment. In examples like #30, holding three jobs was positive. Maybe low impact here since it's just one job, but not necessarily a strong indicator.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant factor as seen in many examples where drug use led to rearrest. This should be high risk.\n\nDepression symptoms: Felt down all month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism by affecting behavior and coping mechanisms. In example #28, depression was present but didn't lead to rearrest, but other factors might have played a role. Still, this is a medium factor as mental health is important.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of four. Family stability can be protective, but in some examples like #1 and #26, family issues were present but not always leading to rearrest. So maybe low impact here since it's stable.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God has nothing to do with his life. In examples, those who had a strong belief sometimes didn't rearrest, while others did. But lack of belief might reduce support systems, so perhaps medium.\n\nNow, weighting these factors:\n\n- Drug use is high (many examples showed drug users rearresting).\n- Depression is medium.\n- Prior arrests and convictions are medium.\n- Lack of education is medium.\n- The rest are low or not as impactful.\n\nConsidering all, the main risks are prior arrests, conviction, drug use, and mental health. These factors in the examples often led to YES predictions when present together. So I would predict YES with high confidence, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; younger individuals may be more impulsive and at higher risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"2 arrests and 1 conviction, which are strong indicators of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"Having a conviction increases the likelihood of rearrest\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college can limit opportunities and increase risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held 1 job during the year; employment can be protective but limited evidence here\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine, which are linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feeling down all month, which may indicate underlying issues affecting behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in a household of 4; stable family background can be protective but not always\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"medium\", \"Considers God has nothing to do with his life; lack of belief may reduce support systems\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
