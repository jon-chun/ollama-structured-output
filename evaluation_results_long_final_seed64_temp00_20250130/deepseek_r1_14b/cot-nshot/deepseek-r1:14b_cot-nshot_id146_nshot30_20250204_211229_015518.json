    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 22-year-old female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 18-19 year olds were sometimes predicted as YES or NO depending on other factors. Age alone doesn't seem to be a high risk here since she's not particularly young.\n\nNext, she identifies as White. In the examples provided, race didn't consistently predict recidivism. Some White individuals had outcomes of YES and others NO, so I'd rate this as low impact.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. In previous cases, multiple arrests were a significant factor. For example, in Example 1, someone with two arrests was predicted as YES. So, this seems like a medium risk because it indicates past law involvement.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so I'll skip those.\n\nShe's never married. In the examples, marital status didn't strongly correlate with outcomes, so low impact here.\n\nCurrently living alone: in some cases, living alone was associated with higher risk, but it wasn't a dominant factor across all examples. So medium might be appropriate, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence recidivism rates; higher education is usually protective. Since she's only at high school level, this could be low risk, but it's not the strongest factor.\n\nShe held 5 jobs during the year. Employment history is generally seen as positive for reducing recidivism. Consistent work might indicate stability, so this would be a medium or high protective factor. I think medium because while employment helps, it's not the only factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor. In many examples, drug use was linked to recidivism. This should probably be a high weight as substance abuse often leads to further criminal behavior.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so the absence of depression here might lower her risk, but it's not a major factor on its own.\n\nLiving in a household of size 3 during youth: family environment can influence outcomes, but without more info, this is low impact.\n\nBelieves God influences her life. In examples, spirituality sometimes was protective, but it wasn't a strong predictor. So low impact here.\n\nNow, weighting these factors:\n\n- Number of arrests and convictions: high (2/3)\n- Drug use: high (1/3)\n- Employment history: medium (-1/3)\n- Living alone: medium (-1/3)\n- Age: low\n- Marital status: low\n- Education: low\n- Family size: low\n- Spirituality: low\n\nAdding these up, the positive risk factors (arrests/drug use) are strong, while protective factors (employment) help but aren't enough to outweigh. So overall, I'd predict YES with moderate confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is not a dominant factor in predicting recidivism in this case.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race does not consistently correlate with recidivism outcomes in the provided examples.\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate past law enforcement involvement, increasing risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest limited social support, which could be a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is generally associated with lower recidivism rates but is not the strongest indicator here\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding 5 jobs indicates stability and responsibility, which may reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month reduces some risk\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 3 during youth has limited information to assess its impact on recidivism\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is not strongly correlated with recidivism outcomes in the examples provided\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
