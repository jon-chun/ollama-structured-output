    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old Asian/Pacific Islander male will rearrest within three years. Let's break down each risk factor based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not extremely so. In previous cases, younger ages were sometimes a high risk, but since he's in his late teens, it might be medium.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He was arrested once and convicted. Looking at examples like #27, where a similar situation led to NO, this seems like a moderate factor. Maybe medium.\n\nRace isn't directly a factor in the examples, so I'll skip weighting it.\n\nResidency status: He's not living alone, which might indicate some instability or lack of support. In example #30, living alone was neutral, but not living alone could be low to medium.\n\nEducation: He has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This is mixed; some examples showed it as neutral, so perhaps low impact.\n\nEmployment: He held one job during the year. Consistent employment can be protective, so maybe low risk here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. In many cases, drug use was a high factor leading to rearrest, so this should be high.\n\nMental health: No depression reported, which is positive, so low impact.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in an urban area with household size 5. Stable family might reduce risk, but not sure how significant it is\u2014maybe medium.\n\nReligious belief: He considers God's role, which could be protective, so perhaps low impact.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factor is drug use (high), arrest history (medium), and maybe age (medium). Other factors are low. Considering examples where similar factors led to NO, I think the prediction would be NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old is relatively young but not extremely so; some examples show higher risk in younger ages\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Arrested once and convicted, which indicates potential for recidivism as seen in examples like #27\"),\n    (\"residency_status\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may indicate some instability but not a significant factor on its own\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is neutral; some examples show no impact from education level\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held one job during the year, which can be protective but not strongly so\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana in past four years, a strong indicator as seen in multiple examples leading to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression, which is neutral\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in an urban area; stable family background can be protective but not always sufficient\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God has a role, which may have protective effects but not strongly predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
