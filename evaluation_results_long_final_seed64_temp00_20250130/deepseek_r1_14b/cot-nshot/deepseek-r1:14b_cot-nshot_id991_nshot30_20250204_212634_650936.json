    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old White male will rearrest within three years. Let's break down each risk factor based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age is 18, which is young but not a minor anymore. In previous cases, younger ages sometimes correlated with higher recidivism, but since he's just out of adolescence, it might be low to medium.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He was arrested once and convicted. Looking at examples like #27, someone with one arrest and conviction had a NO outcome. So maybe this is a medium factor because while it's concerning, it's only one instance.\n\nEmployment: He held 1 job during the year. In example #30, having a job was positive, leading to NO. Consistent employment can be protective, so low weight here.\n\nEducation: Enrolled in a 4-year college. Previous cases showed that being enrolled (like #29) had a YES outcome, but others like #30 with enrollment also had NO. It's mixed, maybe medium because education is generally protective but not always.\n\nLiving situation: Lives alone. In example #16, living alone was a risk factor for YES. So this might be high since it could indicate lack of support.\n\nDrug use: No usage in past four years. This is positive, so low weight as it's a protective factor.\n\nMental health: Not depressed recently. Another protective factor, so low.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4. In example #29, similar family structure led to YES, but others like #30 had NO. Maybe medium because family dynamics can vary.\n\nReligious belief: Considers God's role. In examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism (like #16), so maybe low as it's a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors are mixed. The arrest and living alone might be stronger indicators towards YES, but education and no drug use lean towards NO. I'm leaning towards confidence around 50-60%, predicting NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; younger age may correlate with higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction history, which is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held 1 job during the year, indicating some stability but limited work history\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Enrolled in a 4-year college, which may provide protective factors but not definitive\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"Currently living alone, which may indicate lack of social support and higher risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, a positive factor reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not felt depressed over the past month, indicating good mental health\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4; family dynamics may influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Considers God's role in his life, which may provide positive influences but not directly predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
