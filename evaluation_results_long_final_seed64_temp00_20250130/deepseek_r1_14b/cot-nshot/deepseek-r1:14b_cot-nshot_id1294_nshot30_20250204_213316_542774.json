    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will recidivate within three years based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is relatively young but not extremely so. In previous examples, younger ages were sometimes associated with higher risks, but it's a medium factor here because while age can influence behavior, other factors might have more weight.\n\nNext, he identifies as Black. Looking at the examples, race was mentioned in several cases, and some had outcomes of YES. However, without specific data linking race to recidivism rates beyond what's provided, I'll consider this a low factor since it's a sensitive area and not directly predictive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, prior arrests were sometimes present, but convictions seemed more impactful. Since there's no conviction here, this might be a medium factor because an arrest could indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less certain.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'9\" and 185 lbs. These stats don't seem to correlate directly with recidivism in the examples provided, so I'll rate them as low factors.\n\nMarital status is unmarried and living alone. In previous cases, being single or living alone didn't consistently predict recidivism, so this is a low factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor, but since he's employed, it might indicate stability. This could be a medium factor because education can influence opportunities but isn't directly tied to recidivism here.\n\nEmployment: He held 4 jobs during the year. Consistent employment is generally a positive indicator and associated with lower recidivism rates. This should be a high factor as stable employment reduces the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana). In examples, drug use was present but not always leading to recidivism. However, it's still a significant factor because substance use can contribute to criminal behavior. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo depression symptoms reported in the past month. Mental health issues were mentioned in some cases and could be a risk factor, so the absence here is positive, making it a low factor.\n\nFamily background: Lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more specific information on family support or issues, this is a low factor.\n\nSpirituality: Considers God's role in his life. In examples, spirituality was sometimes present and didn't necessarily correlate with recidivism. This might be a low factor as it's not directly predictive.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the strongest positive indicators are employment (high) and no depression (low). The moderate factors include prior arrest and drug use. Negative factors like race and living alone don't strongly influence here. Overall, the presence of stable employment is significant, which might outweigh other risks. However, there's a history of drug use, which could be a concern.\n\nLooking at similar examples where employment was strong but other factors were present, some resulted in YES while others in NO. Given that he has no conviction and consistent work, I'm leaning towards NO recidivism, but the confidence isn't very high because of the drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old; younger age can be a risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but not directly predictive here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential but not definitive risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Unmarried and living alone; no strong link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma indicates some stability\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Consistent employment is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression symptoms, positive indicator\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Lived with mother in urban area; no direct link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God's role; not directly predictive of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
