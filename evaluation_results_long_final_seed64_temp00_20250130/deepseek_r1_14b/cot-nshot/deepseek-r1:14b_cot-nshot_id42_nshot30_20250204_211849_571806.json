    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this recidivism prediction step by step. I'm going to break down each risk factor for the individual in question and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male of Asian/Pacific Islander descent. Looking at the examples, race wasn't a significant factor unless other variables pointed towards recidivism. So I'll note that but not assign a high weight yet.\n\nHe's been arrested five times without conviction. In previous cases, multiple arrests often led to rearrests, especially if there were convictions. Since he hasn't been convicted, this might be a medium risk because while arrests are concerning, the lack of convictions could indicate no prior sentence that would influence recidivism directly.\n\nHe stands at 5'9\" and weighs 145 lbs. Physical stats didn't seem to play a role in the examples provided, so I'll consider this low impact.\n\nHe's never been married, which is common among many individuals in these cases. Marriage was sometimes linked to lower recidivism rates, but since he hasn't been married, it might not be a strong factor here. So, low weight.\n\nCurrently living alone could be a risk factor because having social support can reduce recidivism. Living alone might mean less supervision and higher chances of relapse into criminal behavior. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is often protective against recidivism, so not being enrolled could be a slight risk. However, having a diploma is better than no education, so maybe low to medium. Let's go with medium because higher education might have been more protective.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without income or structure from work, he might turn back to criminal activities. This should be a high weight.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but isn't currently depressed. Drug use can contribute to recidivism, especially if it's recent. However, without other drug issues or mental health problems, this might be medium risk.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 2 in an urban area. Family dynamics and environment matter. Growing up in an urban area can have more exposure to crime, but living with the father might provide some stability. This seems like a low weight because it's somewhat mitigated by family presence.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior; without such a belief, he might lack internal controls against criminal behavior. This could be medium risk as it affects his personal coping mechanisms.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: multiple arrests (medium), unemployment (high), recent drug use (medium), living alone (medium), and lack of spiritual beliefs (medium). The high weight on unemployment is significant because it's a strong indicator. However, the lack of convictions might slightly mitigate that risk.\n\nLooking at similar examples where someone had multiple arrests but no convictions and other factors like unemployment, rearrest was predicted in some cases. For instance, Example 27 had one arrest, conviction, and living alone, leading to NO. But this case has five arrests without conviction, which is more concerning despite the lack of convictions.\n\nI think the high weight on unemployment combined with multiple arrests and other moderate factors would lean towards a higher risk of rearrest. So, I'll predict \"YES\" with around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old is within the typical age range for recidivism cases\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity does not inherently indicate higher risk based on examples\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"5 arrests without conviction may still indicate potential future issues\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are not significant predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married is common and does not strongly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could reduce social support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not enrolled in college may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological dad, which might provide some stability\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his life may reduce internal controls\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
