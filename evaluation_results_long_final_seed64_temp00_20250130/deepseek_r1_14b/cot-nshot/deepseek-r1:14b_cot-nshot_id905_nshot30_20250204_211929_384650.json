    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not extremely so. In previous examples, younger ages sometimes correlated with higher recidivism rates, especially if other factors are present.\n\nRace is Black. Looking at the examples, there's a pattern where Black individuals had outcomes of both YES and NO, but it's a factor that might carry some weight in real-world data, though I should be cautious about overemphasizing this.\n\nArrest history: arrested twice but no convictions. In the examples, prior arrests without convictions sometimes led to recidivism, especially if other factors are high. So this is probably a medium factor because it's not a conviction but still indicates some law enforcement interaction.\n\nLiving situation: currently living alone. In previous cases, living alone was often associated with higher risk because of less social support. This seems like a medium or maybe high factor.\n\nEducation: has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a protective factor; higher education is linked to lower recidivism. So this might be a low factor since he completed high school but isn't furthering his education, which could mean limited opportunities.\n\nEmployment: held 3 jobs during the year. Stable employment is generally a positive indicator and associated with lower recidivism. This should be a strong protective factor, so maybe low risk here.\n\nDrug use: hasn't used drugs in four years. Abstaining from drug use is a good sign, reducing one potential trigger for crime. So this is a low factor.\n\nMental health: not felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since he's not reporting depression now, this might be a low factor.\n\nFamily background: grew up with his biological mother in a household of 5. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more negative factors like abuse or neglect mentioned, this is probably low risk.\n\nReligious belief: considers God influential in his life. In some studies, strong religious beliefs are associated with lower recidivism rates, so this could be a protective factor, making it a low factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together, the positive ones (employment, no drug use, religious belief) might outweigh the negatives like living alone and prior arrests without convictions. However, the arrest history is still significant because two arrests can indicate a pattern even without convictions. \n\nLooking at similar examples where individuals had 2 arrests but no convictions, some rearrested while others didn't. For instance, Example 1 (age 20, Black, arrested twice) resulted in YES, while another with fewer issues was NO.\n\nIn this case, the person has stable employment and hasn't used drugs recently, which are strong positives. However, living alone might make it harder to stay on track without support systems. \n\nI'm leaning towards a prediction of \"NO\" rearrest because the protective factors seem more impactful than the risk factors in this scenario.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old, which is relatively young and may correlate with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Black individuals have varied outcomes but may carry some weight\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Arrested twice without convictions; indicates potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be a risk factor due to lack of social support\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Completed high school, which is a protective factor but not furthering education may limit opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Stable employment with 3 jobs in the past year; strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years; indicates self-control and reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently; mental health issues can contribute to recidivism but not present here\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with biological mother in a household of 5; no negative dynamics reported\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Strong religious belief may reduce recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
