    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is young but not particularly a high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's White, and looking at previous examples, race didn't seem to be a significant factor in determining recidivism outcomes, so I'll consider this low impact.\n\nArrested 6 times and convicted. In the examples, higher arrest counts (like 6) often led to \"YES\" outcomes, especially when combined with other high-risk factors. So this is a strong indicator\u2014high weight here.\n\nConvicted status might be similar to arrests in terms of risk, so I'll also rate that as high.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so low for both.\n\nNever married\u2014previous examples didn't show marital status as a major factor. So low impact.\n\nLiving alone: In some cases, living with others was associated with lower recidivism, but living alone might mean less support, which could be a risk. I'll rate this medium.\n\nGED certificate and not enrolled in college: Education level can influence opportunities but wasn't a dominant factor in the examples. So low impact.\n\nNo jobs during the year: Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it limits opportunities and increases stress. This should be high weight.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine): Substance abuse is a major predictor of rearrest, so this gets a high rating.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently: Mental health issues can contribute to crime, but since he's not currently depressed, maybe this is low. However, past mental health could still play a role, but the data doesn't show it here.\n\nLiving in a rural area with non-biological parents: Rural areas might have less access to resources and support systems. Also, living with adults who aren't biological parents could indicate instability or lack of strong family support, which is a medium risk factor.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his life: Spirituality can sometimes be protective against crime, so the absence of it might increase risk. I'll rate this as low but consider it in context.\n\nNow, looking at previous examples where similar factors were present:\n\n- High arrest and conviction counts often led to \"YES.\"\n- Unemployment (no jobs) was a strong indicator.\n- Drug use was significant.\n- Other factors like living alone and rural residence added up.\n\nIn the examples, when multiple high-risk factors were present, especially arrest history and unemployment, the outcome was more likely \"YES.\" So combining these, I think the risk is high for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are several strong indicators, some factors like mental health and spirituality might mitigate slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old, not a dominant factor\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White ethnicity did not strongly correlate in examples\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"6 arrests is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"high\", \"Convictions are significant for predicting rearrest\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height does not influence recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight is not a relevant factor\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, but not a dominant factor\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less support, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"GED without college enrollment is neutral\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year indicates unemployment, a strong risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana and cocaine use are significant predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently, but past issues could matter\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Rural area with non-biological parents suggests instability\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has no role, which might slightly increase risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
