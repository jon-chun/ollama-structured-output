    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is young but not particularly high risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's White. Looking at the examples, race didn't seem to be a significant factor in determining recidivism outcomes, so I'll consider this low impact.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. In previous cases, even one arrest without conviction sometimes led to rearrest, but it's not as strong as having a conviction. So medium weight here because an arrest can indicate potential for future issues.\n\nWeight is 204 lbs at 6 feet tall. Obesity might be a factor if it relates to health issues or mobility, but I don't see a direct link to recidivism in the examples provided. Low impact.\n\nNever married and not living alone now. In some cases, being single can mean less stability, but without more info on support systems, this is low impact.\n\nHas a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level might influence opportunities, but without further context, it's low impact.\n\nHe held 4 jobs during the year, which shows he's employed consistently. Employment is generally protective against recidivism, so this should be weighted high as a positive factor.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential rearrest, especially if it leads to further drug-related offenses or relapse. High impact here.\n\nNot felt depressed recently, which is good mental health. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so no depression is positive but not directly tied to other factors in the examples. Low impact.\n\nLived with his mother in a household of 6 in an urban area as a child. Family environment and socioeconomic factors can influence behavior, but without more details on support or crime exposure, it's low impact.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with what happens to him. Spirituality can play a role in rehabilitation, but this individual's lack of belief might not directly correlate unless combined with other issues. Low impact.\n\nNow, considering all factors: the high positive factor is employment (4 jobs), which should reduce recidivism risk. The significant negative factors are prior arrest and recent drug use. In the examples, even one arrest without conviction sometimes led to rearrest, especially when combined with drug use.\n\nLooking at similar cases in the examples, individuals with a single arrest but no conviction and recent drug use often had outcomes of YES for rearrest. For instance, Example 27: arrested once, convicted, used drugs, outcome was NO. But this case has no conviction, which might make it less severe than that example.\n\nHowever, the presence of both prior arrest and recent drug use is concerning. The high weight on drug use could tip the balance towards a higher recidivism risk despite employment.\n\nSo, I'll assign weights as follows:\n\n- Prior Arrest: Medium\n- Drug Use: High\n- Employment: High (positive)\n- Other factors: Low\n\nConsidering these, the positive factor of employment might mitigate but not completely offset the negatives. Therefore, prediction is YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old; no direct correlation to recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White; race was not a significant factor in previous cases\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"1 arrest without conviction; indicates potential risk\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"204 lbs; no direct link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married; stability may be an issue but not a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone; could indicate lack of support system\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"GED certificate; no direct correlation to recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Held 4 jobs; consistent employment is protective\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine recently; strong indicator of potential rearrest\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not depressed; positive but not directly tied to recidivism\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Lived in urban area with mother; no direct correlation\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his outcomes; no strong link to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
