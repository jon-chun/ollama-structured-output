    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Hispanic male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested six times and convicted. Looking at the examples, high arrest counts usually lead to a \"YES.\" For instance, Example 27 had one arrest and conviction but still resulted in \"NO,\" so six is significantly higher, which I'd rate as high risk.\n\nNext, his drug use includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. In previous cases, recent drug use often correlated with recidivism. Examples like #15 and #29 show that drug use can be a strong indicator, so this would be a medium factor.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is generally seen as protective against recidivism. However, since he hasn't held any jobs during the year, his lack of employment might increase his risk. In Examples like #15 and #29, unemployment was a concern, so I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHe lives alone, which can be isolating and may reduce support systems. Previous examples showed that living alone sometimes led to higher recidivism rates, making this a low factor but still notable.\n\nHis history of living in an urban area with his mother in a household of four might indicate some community ties but could also mean exposure to negative influences. This is probably a low factor since it's somewhat neutral.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe God plays a role in his life. In Examples like #15 and #29, lack of spiritual support was mentioned as a risk factor, so this would be a medium consideration.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the high arrest count and drug use are strong indicators pointing towards recidivism. His enrollment in school is positive but may not outweigh other risks. I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"Six prior arrests and convictions strongly indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism, as seen in examples like #2 where high arrest counts led to 'YES'\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for rearrest, as noted in cases such as #15 and #29\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held during the year may indicate limited stability and higher recidivism risk, similar to examples like #15 and #29\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone might reduce support networks but is not a primary factor compared to others\"),\n    (\"residential_history\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing with family may offer some community ties but also exposure to negative influences, as seen in examples like #15 and #29\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God's influence might reduce coping mechanisms, similar to cases where spirituality was a protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
