    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this individual will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22, which is relatively young but not extremely so. In the examples provided, younger ages like 18-20 sometimes led to recidivism, but it's not a direct indicator without other factors.\n\nNext, he identifies as White. Looking at the examples, race didn't seem to be a significant factor on its own in determining rearrest outcomes. So I'll consider this low impact.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. In previous cases, first-time arrests without convictions were sometimes followed by no recidivism, especially if other factors are low. This might be a medium factor because an arrest can indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less severe.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism risk, so I'll mark them as low.\n\nHe's never been married. In the examples, marital status didn't consistently correlate with rearrest outcomes. So this is low.\n\nCurrently living alone: in some cases, living alone might mean less support, but it wasn't a strong predictor in the examples provided. Low impact here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. However, not being enrolled might indicate he's focused on work or other areas. I'll rate this as low since his diploma is present but no further education.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism. Having steady employment can reduce the risk, so this should be a high factor because it's a strong positive indicator.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years: substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism. The absence of recent drug use is very positive, making this a high impact factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so no depression here is good, but it's a low factor because other factors might be more influential.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area: family support can be protective, but urban areas may have higher crime rates. This balances out; I'll consider this medium because while family presence is positive, the urban setting could pose risks.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In examples, spirituality sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, so this might be a low to medium factor, leaning towards positive.\n\nNow, considering all factors: he has several protective factors like employment and no drug use, which are strong. However, he was arrested once without conviction, living alone, and in an urban area. The arrest is a concern but not a conviction, and other factors suggest stability.\n\nLooking at the examples, individuals with similar profiles (one arrest, no conviction, employed, no drugs) often didn't rearrest. For instance, Example 30 had a White male with one arrest, high school diploma, held jobs, no drug use, and lived in an urban area; his outcome was NO.\n\nTherefore, despite the arrest, the positive factors likely outweigh the risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not extremely so in terms of recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race was not a significant factor in previous examples\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential but not definitive risk\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married is neutral\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support but not a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma present, no further education noted\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Steady employment is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"No recent drug use is a strong positive indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression is neutral\"),\n    (\"family_status\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in urban area balances support and potential risks\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may have protective effects but not strongly indicated here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
