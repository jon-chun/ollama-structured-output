    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 20-year-old Black female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Looking at the examples, younger individuals like 18 or 19 had mixed outcomes, but age alone doesn't seem to be a strong indicator here. So I'll rate this as low impact.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In previous cases, even one arrest sometimes led to rearrest, so this is a medium factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so that's low.\n\nShe's never married, which in examples didn't correlate much with outcomes, so another low factor.\n\nLiving alone might be neutral; some examples had living alone without affecting the outcome. So low here too.\n\nShe has a high school diploma. In past cases, education level was sometimes positive but not always. I'll consider this medium because higher education can reduce recidivism, but she's only at high school level.\n\nShe held two jobs, which is a bit inconsistent in examples. Some with similar job history rearrested, others didn't. So low impact here.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) was present in several cases and often led to rearrests. This seems like a strong indicator, so I'll rate this as high.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible mental health issues or stress. In examples, emotional states sometimes correlated with recidivism, so medium here.\n\nLiving in an urban area with her mother in a household of size 3. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but family support might mitigate that. I'll rate this as low because the presence of family could be protective.\n\nLastly, she believes God influences her life. In examples, spirituality sometimes helped reduce recidivism, so medium impact here.\n\nNow, considering all factors: drug use is high, emotional state and spirituality are medium, others are low. The positive factors (education, jobs, family) might counterbalance some negatives. Looking at similar cases where drug use was present but other mitigating factors led to no rearrest, I'm leaning towards NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is not a strong predictor in this case as it's within the typical range for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate potential but is not definitive\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Unmarried status does not strongly correlate with recidivism in this context\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may not be a direct risk factor but could indicate limited support systems\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma suggests some level of education, which can be protective but is not conclusive\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs shows responsibility but does not directly predict recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor for potential drug-related offenses\"),\n    (\"mental_health_emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate stressors that may contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"urban_living\", \"low\", \"Urban environment may have higher crime rates but family presence might mitigate this\"),\n    (\"spirituality_importance\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God's influence can be protective but not always a strong predictor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
