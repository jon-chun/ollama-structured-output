    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Looking at the examples, prior arrests without convictions seem to be a moderate factor because they indicate potential issues but no formal conviction. For instance, in Example 1 and 6, individuals had prior arrests but were predicted as YES or NO based on other factors too.\n\nNext, his weight is 230 lbs, which is quite high. Obesity can sometimes correlate with health issues, but I'm not sure how directly it affects recidivism. Maybe it's a low factor unless there's more context linking weight to behavior.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is generally a positive indicator. Education often reduces recidivism, so this should be a medium or high factor. In Examples 29 and others, education was seen as protective.\n\nLiving alone might be a red flag because lacking social support can increase the risk of rearrest. However, he's only 18, so maybe it's not too concerning yet. I'll rate this as low to medium.\n\nHe has held two jobs, which is good but not extensive. Having some stability is positive, so perhaps a low factor here.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a significant concern. In many examples, drug use was linked to higher recidivism, often rated high. This should be a medium or high factor.\n\nNo depression symptoms are present, which is good. Mental health issues can contribute to crime, so no depression here might lower the risk.\n\nLiving in an urban area with his mother in a household of five could have both positive and negative aspects. Urban areas may have more opportunities for crime but also support networks. I'll consider this as low because family presence might mitigate some risks.\n\nBelieving God influences events is often seen as protective, so that's a low factor.\n\nNow, weighing all these: two arrests (moderate), obesity (low), education (medium), living alone (low-medium), jobs (low), drug use (high), mental health (low), urban residence (low), spirituality (low). The strongest factors are the two arrests and recent drug use. However, his enrollment in school is a strong protective factor.\n\nComparing to examples, someone with similar factors but more severe issues often had YES predictions. But here, education might balance it out. I'm leaning towards NO, but there's still some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest potential issues but no formal legal consequences\"),\n    (\"weight_obesity\", \"low\", \"High weight may not directly correlate with recidivism unless health issues impact behavior\"),\n    (\"education_enrollment\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in school is a strong protective factor against recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at 18 could indicate limited support networks, moderately increasing risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs shows some stability but not extensive history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression reduces potential risks associated with mental health issues\"),\n    (\"residence_urban\", \"low\", \"Urban living may offer more opportunities but also support networks; overall impact is minimal\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence can be a protective factor, though its direct impact on recidivism is unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
