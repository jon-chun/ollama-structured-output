    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old Black female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. In the examples provided, younger individuals like 19 or 20-year-olds sometimes had recidivism outcomes of NO, but I'm not sure if age alone is a significant factor here. Maybe it's more about other factors.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at previous cases, some with one arrest didn't rearrest, while others did. So this might be a medium factor because an arrest could indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it's less severe.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem to impact recidivism directly, so I'll skip those unless they relate to other factors like employment or health, which isn't the case here.\n\nShe hasn't been married. In examples, marital status didn't strongly correlate with rearrest outcomes, so this might be low importance.\n\nCurrently not living alone could mean she's in a more controlled environment or has support, but it might also indicate dependency issues. I'll rate this as medium because living situation can influence behavior.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education is often linked to recidivism rates\u2014lower education can lead to fewer job opportunities, increasing the chance of reoffending. This seems like a high-weight factor.\n\nShe's held four jobs during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism because it provides income and structure. However, holding multiple jobs might indicate instability or that she hasn't found steady employment yet. I'll consider this as medium since it's positive but not consistent.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor for rearrest, especially if it leads to further illegal activities. This is probably a high-weight factor because drug involvement often correlates with crime.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps some times in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism as stress or emotional struggles might lead someone back to criminal behavior. I'll rate this as medium since it's concerning but not severe without more context.\n\nLiving in an urban area with a household size of 10 could mean higher exposure to crime and less individual support, increasing the risk. This is likely a high-weight factor because environment plays a significant role.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. In examples, this belief sometimes correlated with lower recidivism as it might provide a sense of purpose or accountability. I'll rate this as low since it's more about personal coping rather than direct risk factors.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: education level and drug use are high risks, living situation and mental health are medium, while others are low. The combination suggests moderate to high risk. Looking at similar cases in the examples, when there were multiple medium or high factors, outcomes often leaned towards YES for rearrest. However, her employment status is positive, which might mitigate some risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a prediction of \"YES\" with about 65% confidence because education and drug use are strong indicators, but her current job situation provides some protective factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old; no strong correlation in examples\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Arrested once without conviction; indicates potential risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may indicate dependency or support system\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"high\", \"No diploma/GED and not enrolled; linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held 4 jobs, indicating some stability but possibly instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana recently; associated with crime risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feeling down; mental health can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"living_conditions\", \"high\", \"Urban area with large household size; higher exposure to crime\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes in God's role; may offer some protective factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
