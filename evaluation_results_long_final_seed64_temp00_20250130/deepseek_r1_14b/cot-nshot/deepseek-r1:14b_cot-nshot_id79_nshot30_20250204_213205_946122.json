    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old Black male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, a single arrest without conviction seems to be a low risk because in some cases like Example 27 and 30, people with one arrest didn't rearrest. So I'll rate this as low.\n\nNext, his age is 19. The examples show that younger individuals sometimes don't rearrest, but it's not a strong indicator alone. Maybe medium?\n\nHe identifies as Black. In the examples, race was sometimes associated with higher risk, especially in cases where other factors were present. But here, I'm not sure yet; maybe low.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'8\" and 145 lbs. These don't seem to correlate with recidivism, so probably low.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. In some examples, living alone was a risk factor, but others didn't mention it. Maybe medium?\n\nEducation: High school diploma, not enrolled in college. Some examples showed that being educated reduced risk, so maybe low.\n\nEmployment: Held one job during the year. Consistent employment is usually protective, so this should be low.\n\nDrug use: No drug use in four years. That's a strong positive factor, so definitely low.\n\nMental health: He felt down most of the time last month. Depression can increase recidivism risk, so medium here.\n\nFamily background: Lived with biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but without more info, it's a bit unclear. Maybe low?\n\nSpirituality: Believes God is involved in his life. In some examples, this was protective, so probably low.\n\nNow, considering all factors, the strongest indicators are mental health (medium) and past arrest (low). Other factors like employment and no drug use are positive. Given that he's young, Black, and has a recent arrest without conviction, but also employed and not using drugs, I'm leaning towards NO for rearrest. My confidence is around 70% because while mental health is concerning, other factors mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history: arrested once but not convicted\", \"low\", \"In examples like #27 and #30, individuals with one arrest without conviction did not rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Age: 19 years old\", \"medium\", \"Youth can be a risk factor, but it's not definitive in the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Race: Black\", \"low\", \"While race was mentioned in some examples, it wasn't a standalone high-risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight: 5'8\\\" and 145 lbs.\", \"low\", \"No correlation with recidivism in the given data.\"),\n    (\"Marital status: never married, living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate fewer social supports, but examples vary.\"),\n    (\"Education: high school diploma, not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Positive factor suggesting stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment: held one job during the year\", \"low\", \"Consistent employment is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use: no use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Strong positive indicator of lower risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental health: felt down most of last month\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk, as seen in some examples.\"),\n    (\"Family background: lived with mother in urban area\", \"low\", \"Urban setting might be a factor, but not definitive here.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality: believes God is involved\", \"low\", \"In some cases, spirituality was protective.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
