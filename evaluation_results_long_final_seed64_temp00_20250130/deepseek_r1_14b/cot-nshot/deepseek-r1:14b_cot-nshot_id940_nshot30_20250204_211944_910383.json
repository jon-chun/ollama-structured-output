    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 19-year-old female will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Looking at the examples, younger individuals seem to have a higher chance of recidivism. For instance, in Example 27, a 19-year-old male had a \"NO\" outcome, but he was convicted once and had other factors like living alone and drug use. In contrast, Example 29, a 19-year-old female with similar age and some positive factors (like being enrolled in college) ended up with a \"YES.\" So, age might be a medium factor here.\n\nNext, she's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, arrest history is significant. For example, Example 2 had an arrest count of 1 and was predicted \"NO,\" while Example 30 also had one arrest and was \"NO.\" However, in Example 29, a female with one arrest but no conviction resulted in \"YES.\" So, this might be a medium factor because it's not a conviction, but still a red flag.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. In the examples, education seems protective. For example, Examples 1, 6, and others where individuals were in college had lower recidivism rates. So, this should be a strong positive factor, maybe high weight.\n\nShe's living alone. Looking at the examples, living alone can be both good and bad. In Example 27, a male living alone was \"NO,\" but he had other issues like drug use. Here, she's young and might have less support, so this could be a medium negative factor.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism. Examples with steady jobs often had lower rearrest rates. So, this should be a high positive factor.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (cocaine). Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. In many examples, drug users were more likely to reoffend. This should be a high negative factor.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since she's not depressed now, this might be a low positive factor or neutral.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Family stability is generally protective. However, being in an urban area could mean more exposure to crime. In examples, stable family backgrounds were associated with lower recidivism, so this might be a medium positive factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Spirituality can sometimes help reduce recidivism, but it's not the strongest factor. This would likely be low weight.\n\nNow, considering all factors: education and employment are strong positives; arrest history, drug use, and living alone are negatives. Her age is a bit of a wildcard but leans towards higher risk due to being in the high-risk demographic for recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the positive factors might balance some negatives, but given her recent drug use and one arrest, I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_count\", \"medium\", \"1 arrest but no conviction; indicates potential risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"enrolled in a 2-year college and has a high school diploma; protective factor\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"currently living alone; may indicate limited support system\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"held 1 job during the year; employment is generally associated with lower recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"used cocaine in the past four years; drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"not felt depressed in the past month; no indication of mental health issues contributing to risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"lived with both biological parents in an urban area; mixed influence from stable family but urban environment\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"considers God's influence; may have some protective effect, but not a strong factor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
