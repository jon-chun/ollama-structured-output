    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old White male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Looking at the examples, prior arrests without convictions seem to be a moderate factor because in some cases like Example 27 and 30, people with one arrest didn't rearrest, while others with more arrests did. So maybe two arrests is medium.\n\nNext, his drug use: he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. In examples, recent drug use often led to higher recidivism rates, so this should be a high-weight factor.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which usually indicates lower risk because education can deter crime. So that's a low weight.\n\nLiving alone might mean less support, but it's not as strong as other factors. Maybe medium? Or perhaps low since he's still young and maybe has other supports.\n\nNo prior convictions are positive, so that's low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good, so low.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents might be a bit mixed. Urban areas can have more opportunities for crime but also support systems. Maybe medium because it's not clearly positive or negative.\n\nBelieving God influences his life could be either way\u2014some studies say it reduces recidivism, others say it depends. I'll lean towards low since it's a personal belief and might provide support.\n\nPutting it all together: drug use is high, prior arrests are medium, education is low, living alone is medium, family background is medium, mental health is low, religion is low. The strongest factor here is the drug use, which often correlates with higher recidivism. However, being enrolled in school and having a stable home situation might counterbalance some of that.\n\nLooking at similar examples, someone with two arrests, recent drug use, but in school didn't always rearrest. For instance, Example 29 had one arrest, used drugs, was in college, and the outcome was YES. So maybe this case is similar.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest some risk but not severe\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine indicates higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"education_enrollment\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school is a positive factor reducing risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited support networks\"),\n    (\"no_prior_convictions\", \"low\", \"No convictions despite arrests shows some responsibility\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently is a positive sign\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with both parents could have mixed influences\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God's influence, which may provide support but not directly predictive\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
