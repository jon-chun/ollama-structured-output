    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 18-year-old White male will be rearrested within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at his age: he's 18, which is a common age for first-time offenses. In the examples provided, younger individuals like 19 or 20-year-olds had varying outcomes, so age alone might not be a strong indicator here.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but not convicted. In previous cases, having an arrest without conviction sometimes didn't lead to rearrest, especially if it was a minor offense. However, arrests can still indicate potential for future issues, so I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 185 lbs. Physical size isn't directly linked to recidivism in the examples provided, so I'll consider this low impact.\n\nHe's never married, which is common among individuals his age. In the examples, marital status didn't seem to influence rearrest outcomes much, so this factor is low.\n\nCurrently living alone might be a concern because having social support can reduce recidivism. However, in some cases, living alone wasn't a significant factor, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level was a notable factor in previous examples; those without education had higher rearrest rates. This seems like a strong indicator, so I'll assign it a high weight.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employment can be protective against recidivism, but having only one job might not be sufficient. In some cases, consistent employment was positive, so this is medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Drug involvement was often linked to rearrests, so this absence should be seen as low risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is another protective factor. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not reporting depression, this is low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a household of five suggests some family support, which generally reduces recidivism. However, larger families might have more complexities, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In examples, spirituality sometimes helped reduce recidivism, but it wasn't a dominant factor, so this is low.\n\nNow, considering all factors: education level stands out as high risk because lack of education correlates with higher rearrest rates. His arrest history and living situation are medium risks. Positive aspects like no drug use and employment might mitigate some risks, but the strong influence of education suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old; examples show younger individuals may have higher risk\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Arrested once without conviction; some examples showed rearrest after first offense\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly linked to recidivism in examples\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, but age is typical for this status\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support; some examples showed higher risk when living alone\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college; education was a strong predictor in examples\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held one job; employment can be protective but limited history\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years; absence of drug issues is positive\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not felt depressed recently; mental health status not reported as an issue\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in a household of five; family support can be protective but size may complicate\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences his life; examples showed mixed impact of spirituality on recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
