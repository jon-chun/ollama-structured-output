    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict whether this 22-year-old Hispanic male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted once. Looking at the examples, prior arrests are a strong indicator. For instance, in Example 1, someone with two arrests and a conviction had a \"YES.\" So this is a high-weight factor.\n\nNext, his education status: no diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Many examples showed that lack of education correlates with higher recidivism. Examples like #27 and #30 where similar situations led to \"NO,\" but I'm not sure if it's the main driver here.\n\nHe's living alone, which might be a neutral factor. Some examples had people living alone with both outcomes, so maybe low weight.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Examples like #1 and #29 where drug use was present led to \"YES,\" so this should be high weight.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible depression or stress. Mental health issues can increase recidivism. Examples like #28 had similar feelings leading to \"NO,\" but it's still a medium factor.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both parents in an urban area with a household size of 6. This is mixed; some examples showed positive outcomes, others not. Maybe low weight here.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In examples like #1 and #27, similar beliefs didn't prevent rearrest. So perhaps medium impact.\n\nPutting it all together: prior arrests (high), drug use (high), mental health (medium), education (low), living alone (low), family background (low), spirituality (medium). The strongest factors are prior arrests and drug use, which both point towards higher risk. His recent mood might add to that. So I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History: 2 arrests, 1 conviction\", \"high\", \"Prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism; examples show high correlation\"),\n    (\"Education Status: No diploma/GED, not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education can be a risk factor but varies in impact across examples\"),\n    (\"Currently Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate limited support systems but is less directly correlated with recidivism\"),\n    (\"Drug Use in Past 4 Years: Marijuana and Cocaine\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use strongly correlates with higher recidivism rates as seen in multiple examples\"),\n    (\"Mental Health: Felt down in the dumps recently\", \"medium\", \"Mental health struggles can contribute to recidivism but are less direct than other factors\"),\n    (\"Family Background: Grew up with both biological parents in an urban area, household size 6\", \"low\", \"Mixed impact; some examples show stability while others show challenges\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/Belief: Considers God influences what happens\", \"medium\", \"Beliefs can influence behavior but are less deterministic in predicting recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
