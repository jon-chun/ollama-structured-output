    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female identifying as Black. Age is a significant factor in criminal justice risk assessments. Young adults, especially those in their late teens and early twenties, tend to have higher rates of offending. However, being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, there's a mix here: young age might indicate higher risk, but being female suggests lower risk.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. This is important because an arrest without conviction could suggest that the charges were unfounded or dropped, which might not necessarily indicate a high risk of reoffending. However, the fact that she was arrested could still be a red flag, especially if the circumstances around the arrest were serious.\n\nShe is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 134 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight are generally not directly related to recidivism risk. So, I'll consider these factors as neutral.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living situation can be a factor; living alone might indicate less social support, which could potentially increase risk. However, this isn't always the case, as some individuals manage well independently.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. Education level is important; having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in higher education might suggest limited future prospects, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year. Employment history is crucial. Holding down two jobs suggests responsibility and stability, which are positive signs.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and has experienced periods of depression in the past month. Substance use and mental health issues are significant risk factors. Marijuana use, while illegal in many places, is less severe than harder drug use, but any drug use can indicate potential for other risky behaviors. The depressive symptoms also raise concerns about mental health, which, if untreated, can contribute to recidivism.\n\nLastly, her childhood living situation: she lived with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area and considers God personally significant in her life. Family structure and upbringing can influence criminal behavior, but without more details, it's hard to assign a specific weight to this factor. Living in an urban area might expose her to higher crime rates, which could be a risk factor.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. Age: 20 years old - Medium risk (young age increases risk, but not as high as teenagers)\n\n2. Gender: Female - Low risk (females generally have lower recidivism rates)\n\n3. Arrest history: Arrested once, no conviction - Low to medium risk (arrest suggests some involvement, but no conviction is positive)\n\n4. Physical attributes: Height and weight - Neutral\n\n5. Marital status and living situation: Never married, lives alone - Medium risk (potential lack of social support)\n\n6. Education: High school diploma, not in college - Medium risk (completed high school is good, but no higher education might limit opportunities)\n\n7. Employment: Held two jobs in the year - Low risk (indicates responsibility and stability)\n\n8. Substance use: Marijuana use in past four years - Medium risk (less severe drug, but still a risk factor)\n\n9. Mental health: Depressive symptoms in the past month - High risk (mental health issues can significantly increase recidivism risk)\n\n10. Upbringing: Lives with biological mother in urban area, religious beliefs - Low to medium risk (stable family structure, but urban environment might have higher crime exposure)\n\nConsidering all these factors, the prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is YES, with a confidence of 65%. The high-risk factor of recent depressive symptoms and the medium-risk factors of substance use, living alone, and education level outweigh the low-risk factors of being female and having stable employment.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"Young age increases risk, but not as high as teenagers\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"Low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates\"],\n    [\"Arrest history\", \"Low to medium\", \"Arrest suggests some involvement, but no conviction is positive\"],\n    [\"Physical attributes\", \"Neutral\", \"Height and weight not directly related to risk\"],\n    [\"Marital status and living situation\", \"Medium\", \"Potential lack of social support\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"Medium\", \"High school diploma is good, but no higher education limits opportunities\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"Low\", \"Indicates responsibility and stability\"],\n    [\"Substance use\", \"Medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor\"],\n    [\"Mental health\", \"High\", \"Depressive symptoms can significantly increase recidivism risk\"],\n    [\"Upbringing\", \"Low to medium\", \"Stable family structure, but urban environment may expose to higher crime\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n",
