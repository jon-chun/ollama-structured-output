    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female identifying as White. Age and gender can be significant factors in recidivism rates. Generally, younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, but being female tends to lower the risk compared to males. So, these two factors might balance each other out somewhat.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. This is her first conviction, which is a positive sign. First-time offenders often have lower recidivism rates compared to those with multiple convictions.\n\nHer height and weight\u20145 feet 5 inches and 130 lbs\u2014don't seem directly relevant to recidivism risk unless there are specific circumstances where physical attributes play a role, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living situation can be a factor; stable housing and social support can reduce recidivism risk. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is crucial. Lower education levels are associated with higher recidivism rates because they limit employment opportunities.\n\nShe has held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor, as consistent employment is linked to lower recidivism. However, holding multiple jobs might also indicate a strong work ethic or financial needs that could be managed positively.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, and has recently experienced depressive symptoms. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors for recidivism. Drug use can lead to criminal behavior, and untreated mental health issues can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nFrom her childhood, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three. Family structure and environment during upbringing can influence criminal behavior, but without more details, it's hard to assign a specific risk level here.\n\nShe believes that God has nothing to do with personal events, which might indicate a lack of religious involvement. Some studies suggest that religious participation can reduce recidivism by providing support and moral guidance, but this factor is less straightforward.\n\nLet me list these factors with their respective risk levels:\n\n1. Age: 20 years old - Medium (young age increases risk, but not extremely high)\n\n2. Gender: Female - Low (generally lower recidivism rates)\n\n3. Race: White - Medium (depending on specific statistics, but not a high-risk category)\n\n4. Arrest and conviction history: One arrest, one conviction - Low (first-time offender)\n\n5. Living situation: Lives alone with no marital status - Medium (potential lack of social support)\n\n6. Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college - High (limited educational attainment increases risk)\n\n7. Employment: Held three jobs in a year - Medium (job instability could indicate risk, but multiple jobs might show work ethic)\n\n8. Substance abuse: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, recent depressive symptoms - High (substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risks)\n\n9. Family background: Lived with biological mother in a household of three - Low (without specific negative factors, this is neutral to low risk)\n\n10. Religious involvement: Believes God has no personal impact - Medium (possible lower support from religious communities)\n\nNow, considering these factors collectively, the highest-risk factors are education level and substance abuse/mental health issues. These are critical areas that need attention to reduce recidivism risk.\n\nGiven this assessment, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest within three years due to the combination of limited education, substance abuse, and mental health concerns. However, the individual's gender and first-time offender status somewhat mitigate these risks.\n\nI estimate the prediction to be \"YES\" with a confidence of 70%. This means there is a significant risk of recidivism, but there are also factors that could lead to a different outcome if appropriate interventions are in place.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"Young age increases risk, but not extremely high\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"Low\", \"Generally lower recidivism rates for females\"],\n    [\"Race\", \"Medium\", \"Depending on specific statistics, but not high-risk\"],\n    [\"Arrest and conviction history\", \"Low\", \"First-time offender\"],\n    [\"Living situation\", \"Medium\", \"Potential lack of social support\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"High\", \"Limited educational attainment increases risk\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"Medium\", \"Job instability could indicate risk, but multiple jobs show work ethic\"],\n    [\"Substance abuse and mental health\", \"High\", \"Significant risks due to drug use and depressive symptoms\"],\n    [\"Family background\", \"Low\", \"Neutral to low risk without specific negative factors\"],\n    [\"Religious involvement\", \"Medium\", \"Possible lower support from religious communities\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
