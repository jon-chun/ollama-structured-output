    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female identifying as White. Age and gender are important factors in recidivism predictions. Generally, younger individuals have higher recidivism rates, but being female typically lowers the risk compared to males. So, age might be a medium risk factor, while gender is low.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests that her involvement with the criminal justice system is minimal so far. Lack of conviction could indicate that the arrest didn't lead to charges or she was found not guilty. This would likely be a low-risk factor.\n\nHer physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014don't directly correlate with recidivism rates as far as I know, so I'll consider this neutral or low risk.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married and lives alone. Living situation can be relevant; living alone might slightly increase the risk compared to living with family or partners, but it's not a strong predictor on its own. Maybe a low-medium risk.\n\nEducation: She has a Bachelor's degree and is not currently enrolled in college. Higher education levels are generally associated with lower recidivism rates. So, this is a low-risk factor.\n\nEmployment: She has held four jobs in the past year. High job instability can be a risk factor for recidivism, as unstable employment may lead to engagement in criminal activities. This could be a medium to high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has recently experienced depressive symptoms. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors for recidivism. This is likely a high-risk factor.\n\nFamily background: She lived with both biological parents in an urban area in a household of four. Stable family environments are generally protective against criminal behavior. However, urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could influence exposure to criminal activities. This is a bit nuanced; perhaps a low-medium risk.\n\nReligious belief: She believes that God has nothing to do with personal events. Religious involvement can be a protective factor against recidivism, but lack thereof might increase risk. However, this is a somewhat subjective factor and may not be as strong as others. Low-medium risk.\n\nNow, let's compile these assessments:\n\n1. Age: Medium risk (young age)\n2. Gender: Low risk (female)\n3. Arrest history: Low risk (only one arrest, no conviction)\n4. Physical attributes: Low risk\n5. Marital status/living situation: Low-Medium risk (living alone)\n6. Education: Low risk (Bachelor's degree)\n7. Employment stability: Medium-High risk (four jobs in a year)\n8. Substance use and mental health: High risk\n9. Family background: Low-Medium risk\n10. Religious belief: Low-Medium risk\n\nConsidering these factors, the high-risk factors are substance use and mental health issues, and employment instability. The low-risk factors include gender, education, and arrest history. The medium-risk factors relate to age, living situation, and family background.\n\nGiven that, I would predict a higher likelihood of recidivism due to the significant risks posed by substance abuse, mental health, and employment instability. However, the protective factors like education and gender temper this risk somewhat.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" for rearrest within 3 years, with a confidence level around 70%.\n\nPutting it all together in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction.\"),\n    (\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital status/living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may slightly increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Higher education levels correlate with lower recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment stability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes can indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"Substance use and mental health\", \"high\", \"Drug use and recent depressive symptoms are high-risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Stable family environment but urban location may expose to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious involvement may increase risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n",
