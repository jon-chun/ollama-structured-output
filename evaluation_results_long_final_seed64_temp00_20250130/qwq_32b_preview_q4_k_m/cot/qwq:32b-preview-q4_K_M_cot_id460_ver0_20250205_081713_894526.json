    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let's see, he's a 20-year-old white male, arrested once but not convicted, height 6'0\", weight 204 lbs, never married, not living alone, has a GED, not in college, had four jobs in the last year, used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, no depression in the last month, lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area, and he doesn't believe God has anything to do with personal events.\n\nFirst off, let's list out the risk factors and try to assign relative weights to each based on their potential impact on recidivism.\n\n1. **Age**: He's 20 years old. Generally, younger age is associated with higher recidivism rates, but as people mature, they tend to stabilize and stay out of trouble. So, being 20 might still be in that higher-risk category.\n\n2. **Gender**: Male. Males are statistically more likely to reoffend than females.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: White. In some studies, race can be a factor, but it's important to handle this sensitively and ensure that any considerations are based on statistical trends rather than stereotypes.\n\n4. **Arrest Record**: Arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might suggest minor involvement or circumstances that didn't lead to charges, which could be less indicative of future offenses compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\n\n5. **Conviction History**: No convictions. This is positive, as having no conviction history generally lowers the risk of recidivism.\n\n6. **Marital Status**: Never married. Some research suggests that being married can reduce criminal behavior due to increased social ties and responsibilities.\n\n7. **Living Situation**: Not living alone. Living with others might provide support but could also mean exposure to influences that encourage criminal behavior, depending on the household members.\n\n8. **Education Level**: GED. Having a GED is better than no high school diploma, but it's still lower than a traditional diploma, which could limit job opportunities and potentially lead to frustration and involvement in crime.\n\n9. **Employment History**: Held four jobs in the last year. High job turnover can be a risk factor, as unstable employment is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\n10. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially of harder substances like cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as substance abuse can lead to criminal activity to support the habit.\n\n11. **Mental Health**: No depression in the last month. Mental health issues can be a contributing factor to criminal behavior, so the absence of recent depression is positive.\n\n12. **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Large households might have less supervision per child, which could be a risk factor.\n\n13. **Religious Belief**: Doesn't believe God has anything to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against recidivism, so lack thereof might be a minor risk factor.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. **Age**: Medium. Being 20 is still relatively young, but not in the peak crime-committing years.\n\n2. **Gender**: High. Males have higher recidivism rates.\n\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Low. While there might be some statistical differences, it's a minor factor compared to others.\n\n4. **Arrest Record**: Low. Only one arrest without conviction isn't strongly predictive.\n\n5. **Conviction History**: Low. No convictions is positive.\n\n6. **Marital Status**: Medium. Never married could indicate less social stability.\n\n7. **Living Situation**: Medium. Not living alone could be either positive or negative depending on the household dynamics.\n\n8. **Education Level**: Medium. GED is better than no diploma but still lower than a traditional degree.\n\n9. **Employment History**: High. Frequent job changes suggest instability, which is a risk factor.\n\n10. **Drug Use**: High. Use of marijuana and cocaine indicates potential substance abuse issues, which are strongly linked to recidivism.\n\n11. **Mental Health**: Low. No recent depression is positive.\n\n12. **Family Background**: Medium. Large household in urban area could indicate lower supervision.\n\n13. **Religious Belief**: Low. Lack of religious belief might be a minor risk factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors collectively:\n\n- Positive factors: No convictions, no recent depression, GED education.\n\n- Negative factors: Young age, male gender, drug use, employment instability, living in a large household.\n\nGiven that several key risk factors are present, particularly drug use and employment instability, I would predict a higher likelihood of rearrest recidivism over the next three years.\n\n**Prediction**: YES\n\n**Confidence**: 75%\n\nSo, compiling this into the required JSON format:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Being 20 years old is still relatively young, associated with higher recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Males have statistically higher recidivism rates.\"],\n    [\"Race/Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White; race is a minor factor in recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest without conviction, less predictive.\"],\n    [\"Conviction History\", \"low\", \"No convictions is positive.\"],\n    [\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may indicate less social stability.\"],\n    [\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone could be positive or negative depending on household dynamics.\"],\n    [\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"GED is better than no diploma but still lower than a traditional degree.\"],\n    [\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Held four jobs in the last year indicates employment instability, a significant risk factor.\"],\n    [\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine suggests potential substance abuse issues linked to recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is positive.\"],\n    [\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Large household in urban area may indicate lower supervision.\"],\n    [\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief might be a minor risk factor.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n",
