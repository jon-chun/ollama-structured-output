    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female identifying as Black. Age and gender can be significant factors in recidivism rates. Generally, younger individuals are more likely to reoffend, but being female typically lowers the risk compared to males. So, age might be a medium risk factor, while gender is low.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests that either the charges were dropped or she was found not guilty. Since there's no conviction, this might indicate lower risk, but the arrest itself could suggest some level of involvement in criminal activity. I'll rate this as low to medium.\n\nShe is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 158 lbs. Physical attributes like height and weight aren't typically strong predictors of recidivism. So, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nLiving status: She's living alone and has never been married. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to lack of social support, but this isn't always the case. Never being married could also be neutral or slightly increase risk. I'll rate this as low to medium.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. Education level can be important; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Not being enrolled in college might suggest less engagement in positive activities, but having a high school diploma is better than no diploma. I'll call this low to medium.\n\nEmployment: She has held three jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can sometimes indicate instability, which might be a risk factor. However, it could also mean she's seeking better opportunities. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use: She hasn't used drugs in the past four years but has used some in the past month. This is a bit confusing. If she's used drugs in the past month, that contradicts the statement about not using drugs in the past four years. Assuming there's a typo and she hasn't used drugs in the past four years, including the last month, that would be positive. But if she has used drugs in the past month, that could be a significant risk factor. Given the confusion, I'll assume she has used drugs in the past month, which would be high risk.\n\nMental health: She has felt down and nothing could cheer her up some of the time in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are known risk factors for recidivism if not managed properly. I'll rate this as medium to high.\n\nEarly household environment: She lived in a household of size two when young. The size of the household alone isn't a strong predictor; it's more about the quality of the home environment, parenting styles, and presence of violence or substance abuse, which aren't specified here. So, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: She believes God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against recidivism, providing support and structure. However, it's not always straightforward, as beliefs can vary widely. I'll rate this as low to medium.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Age: Medium\n\n- Gender: Low\n\n- Arrest history: Low-Medium\n\n- Physical attributes: Low\n\n- Living status: Low-Medium\n\n- Education: Low-Medium\n\n- Employment stability: Medium\n\n- Drug use: High\n\n- Mental health: Medium-High\n\n- Early household environment: Low\n\n- Religious beliefs: Low-Medium\n\nGiven these factors, the presence of drug use in the past month and potential mental health issues are significant concerns. The employment instability also adds to the risk. However, positive factors include her gender, education level, and religious beliefs.\n\nConsidering all this, I would predict a higher likelihood of recidivism over the next three years. Let's say a 70% confidence in predicting recidivism.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n\n(\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n\n(\"Arrest history\", \"low-medium\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests possible involvement but no formal finding of guilt.\"),\n\n(\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"Living status\", \"low-medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n\n(\"Education\", \"low-medium\", \"High school diploma is positive, but not enrolled in college may indicate less engagement in prosocial activities.\"),\n\n(\"Employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can be a risk factor.\"),\n\n(\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use increases the risk of recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"Mental health\", \"medium-high\", \"Reported depression symptoms could impact decision-making and increase recidivism risk if not managed.\"),\n\n(\"Early household environment\", \"low\", \"Household size alone is not a strong predictor without additional context.\"),\n\n(\"Religious beliefs\", \"low-medium\", \"Belief in God may provide support and structure, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 70\n\n}\n\n",
