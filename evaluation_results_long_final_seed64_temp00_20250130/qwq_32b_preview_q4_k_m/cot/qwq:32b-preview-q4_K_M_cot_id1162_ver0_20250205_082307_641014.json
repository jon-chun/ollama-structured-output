    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 20-year-old Hispanic female over the next three years. Let's break down the information provided and see how each factor might influence the prediction.\n\nFirst off, she's 20 years old. Age is a significant factor in criminal behavior. Generally, younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities, but as they age, this tendency decreases. So, being 20, she's still in that higher-risk age group. I'll mark age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as Hispanic. Ethnicity can be a factor due to socioeconomic disparities and potential biases in the justice system. However, it's not directly indicative of recidivism. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests don't always lead to convictions, and since there's no conviction, perhaps the severity was low or there wasn't enough evidence. This suggests a lower likelihood of reoffending compared to someone with multiple convictions. So, I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nHer height and weight are given as 5'5\" and between 125-149 lbs. Physical attributes like these don't typically correlate with recidivism rates. So, I'll consider this a non-factor.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status can sometimes be associated with stability and lower recidivism rates, but the relationship isn't straightforward. Living situation is also important; living alone might sometimes indicate isolation, but not always. Given that she's not living alone, perhaps she has some social support, which is positive. Overall, I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. However, she has completed high school, which is better than not having a diploma, but not pursuing higher education might limit her employment opportunities. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Employment history is crucial. Stable employment can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Holding one job suggests some stability, but it's only been for a year. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine, and she hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially since she has used harder drugs like cocaine. Current mental health seems stable, which is positive, but past drug use is a red flag. I'll mark this as high risk.\n\nShe lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size four in an urban area. This suggests a somewhat unstable home environment during her formative years, which could indicate factors like neglect or poor supervision. Growing up in an urban area can also expose individuals to higher crime rates. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nLastly, she believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and moral guidance, which may influence behavior. Lack of such beliefs doesn't necessarily correlate with higher recidivism, but it might mean she lacks that particular source of support. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nNow, compiling these factors:\n\n- Age: Medium\n\n- Ethnicity: Low\n\n- Arrest/conviction history: Low\n\n- Physical attributes: Non-factor\n\n- Marital and living situation: Low\n\n- Education: Medium\n\n- Employment: Medium\n\n- Substance abuse and mental health: High\n\n- Upbringing and environment: Medium\n\n- Spiritual beliefs: Low\n\nConsidering all these, the highest risk factor is substance abuse, particularly the use of harder drugs like cocaine. This significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending, especially given the addictive nature of these substances and the potential for involvement in criminal activities to sustain drug use.\n\nThe medium-risk factors include age, education, employment, and upbringing/environment. These suggest some areas of concern but also indicate that she has completed high school and has held a job, which are positive signs.\n\nThe low-risk factors and non-factors provide some stability and suggest that she doesn't possess the highest risk attributes in these areas.\n\nOverall, while there are several medium and one high-risk factors, the presence of the high-risk substance abuse stands out. However, her current mental health is stable, and she has some educational attainment and employment history, which are protective factors.\n\nGiven this balanced profile, I would predict a moderate likelihood of rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Perhaps around 60% confidence that she will be rearrested.\n\nSo, my prediction is YES, with a confidence of 60.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    [\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher risk of criminal behavior.\"],\n    [\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Arrest/Conviction History\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest with no conviction suggests lower risk.\"],\n    [\"Physical Attributes\", \"non-factor\", \"Height and weight are not correlated with recidivism.\"],\n    [\"Marital and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may indicate some social support.\"],\n    [\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but no college enrollment; limited employment opportunities.\"],\n    [\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Held one job for a year, showing some stability but short tenure.\"],\n    [\"Substance Abuse and Mental Health\", \"high\", \"History of drug use, including hard drugs, increases risk.\"],\n    [\"Upbringing and Environment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable home environment and urban upbringing may contribute to higher risk.\"],\n    [\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of spiritual beliefs doesn't directly correlate with recidivism.\"]\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n",
