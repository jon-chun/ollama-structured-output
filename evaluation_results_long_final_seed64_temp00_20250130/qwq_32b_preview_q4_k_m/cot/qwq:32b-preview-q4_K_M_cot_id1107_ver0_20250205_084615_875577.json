    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. Age and gender are known risk factors; young males tend to have higher rates of recidivism. So, being 19 and male might be a medium to high risk factor. But I need to consider other aspects too.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could indicate involvement in criminal activities, but without a conviction, it's harder to confirm. Maybe a low to medium risk here.\n\nHis height is 5'8\" and weight is 280 lbs. Physical attributes like weight might not directly correlate with recidivism. Unless there are specific circumstances where his size could be an advantage in certain crimes, I'll consider this as a low risk factor.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage is often considered a protective factor against recidivism because it can provide stability and support. So, this might be a low risk factor or even a mitigating one.\n\nLack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college could be a risk factor. Education level is linked to employment opportunities, and limited education might increase the likelihood of turning to crime. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has held five jobs in a year. That seems like high job instability, which could be a risk factor. Instability in employment might indicate difficulty maintaining steady work, possibly leading to involvement in criminal activities. So, this could be a medium to high risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically cocaine, is a significant risk factor. Substance abuse is closely linked to criminal behavior, both as a cause and a consequence. Given that he has used cocaine recently, this is likely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can be related to recidivism, so the absence of recent depression is a low risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents but in a household of seven might indicate a challenging family environment. Large families in urban settings could face socioeconomic challenges that increase criminal risk. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHis belief in God's influence on personal events could be either positive or negative. Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can be protective, providing moral guidance and support. However, it could also lead to rigid thinking in some cases. Overall, I'll consider this a low risk factor, possibly leaning towards protective.\n\nNow, let's compile these assessments:\n\n1. Age and Gender: High\n\n2. Arrests without Convictions: Medium\n\n3. Physical Attributes: Low\n\n4. Marital Status: Low\n\n5. Education Level: Medium\n\n6. Employment Stability: High\n\n7. Drug Use: High\n\n8. Recent Depression: Low\n\n9. Upbringing: Medium\n\n10. Religious Beliefs: Low\n\nConsidering these factors, particularly the high-risk factors like age and gender, employment stability, and drug use, I would predict a higher likelihood of recidivism.\n\nHowever, protective factors like being married, not currently depressed, and having religious beliefs might slightly mitigate this risk.\n\nGiven the balance of risk and protective factors, I would predict a YES for rearrest recidivism over the next three years with a confidence level of around 75%.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"risk_factors\": [\n\n(\"Age and Gender\", \"high\", \"Young males have higher recidivism rates.\"),\n\n(\"Arrests without Convictions\", \"medium\", \"Arrest history suggests potential involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n\n(\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism.\"),\n\n(\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Marriage is a protective factor.\"),\n\n(\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Limited education may limit employment opportunities.\"),\n\n(\"Employment Stability\", \"high\", \"High job turnover indicates instability.\"),\n\n(\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially hard drugs like cocaine, is a significant risk factor.\"),\n\n(\"Recent Depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is positive.\"),\n\n(\"Upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Large urban household may present challenges.\"),\n\n(\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's personal influence could be protective.\")\n\n],\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 75\n\n}\n\n",
