    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a 3-year period. Let's break down the information provided and evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female identifying as Black. Age is an important factor in recidivism studies. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens and early twenties, tend to have higher rates of recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of maturity. However, being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males. So, there's a mix here: young age increases risk, but being female decreases it.\n\nNext, she has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests that either the charges were dropped, or she was found not guilty. The fact that there's no conviction is positive, indicating that perhaps the arrest was unfounded or handled appropriately by the legal system. However, an arrest itself could be a marker of some level of involvement in criminal activity, even if not resulting in a conviction.\n\nHer height and weight are given as 5 feet 10 inches and 165 lbs. Physical attributes like these don't typically have a direct correlation with recidivism. They might be relevant in certain contexts, such as if someone's size could be associated with the type of crimes they're involved in, but generally, they're not significant factors in risk assessment.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status can be a factor; being unmarried sometimes correlates with higher recidivism rates, possibly due to lack of social support or stability. Living alone could also indicate less social supervision or fewer accountability measures in place.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. Education level is crucial. Having a high school diploma is better than no diploma, but higher education can further reduce recidivism risk by providing better employment opportunities and intellectual stimulation. Not being enrolled in college might suggest limited future prospects, which could increase the risk of turning to crime.\n\nShe has held four jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism. Stable employment is generally protective against reoffending.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years and has experienced depressive symptoms recently. Substance use and mental health issues are significant risk factors. Marijuana use, while less severe than harder drugs, can still impair judgment and lead to involvement in criminal activities, especially if seeking to support a drug habit. The depressive symptoms could also indicate underlying mental health issues that, if untreated, might contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nEarly life circumstances: She lived with her biological mother in an urban area in a household of three. Family structure and environment during upbringing can influence future behavior. Living with both parents is often considered ideal, but single-parent households are common and not necessarily detrimental, especially if the home environment is stable and supportive. Urban areas may have higher crime rates, which could influence exposure to criminal activities.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with what happens personally. Spiritual or religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing moral guidance and a support system. However, this depends on how these beliefs are integrated into her life.\n\nNow, let's assign relative weights to these factors:\n\n1. Age: 20 years old - High risk due to youth.\n2. Gender: Female - Low risk.\n3. Arrest history: Arrested once, not convicted - Medium risk.\n4. Physical attributes: Height and weight - Not relevant; Low risk.\n5. Marital status: Never married, living alone - Medium risk.\n6. Education: High school diploma, not in college - Medium risk.\n7. Employment stability: Four jobs in a year - High risk.\n8. Substance use: Marijuana use in past four years - Medium risk.\n9. Mental health: Recent depressive symptoms - High risk.\n10. Early family environment: Single-parent household in urban area - Medium risk.\n11. Religious beliefs: Believes God influences personal events - Low risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors collectively:\n\n- High-risk factors: Age, employment stability, mental health.\n- Medium-risk factors: Arrest history, marital status, education, early family environment, substance use.\n- Low-risk factors: Gender, physical attributes, religious beliefs.\n\nThe high-risk factors are particularly concerning, especially the mental health issues and employment instability. These can create a volatile combination where the individual may turn to criminal activities due to lack of stable opportunities and emotional distress.\n\nGiven this assessment, I would predict a higher likelihood of recidivism over the next three years. However, it's important to note that predictive models are not deterministic and that interventions targeted at addressing employment stability and mental health could significantly alter this outlook.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases impulsivity and lack of maturity.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"medium\", \"Arrest but no conviction suggests potential involvement without formal adjudication.\"),\n    (\"Physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly correlated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital status\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried and living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment limits future prospects.\"),\n    (\"Employment stability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability.\"),\n    (\"Substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor, though less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"high\", \"Recent depressive symptoms could lead to risky behaviors if untreated.\"),\n    (\"Early family environment\", \"medium\", \"Single-parent household in urban area may influence exposure to crime.\"),\n    (\"Religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Spiritual beliefs can provide a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n",
