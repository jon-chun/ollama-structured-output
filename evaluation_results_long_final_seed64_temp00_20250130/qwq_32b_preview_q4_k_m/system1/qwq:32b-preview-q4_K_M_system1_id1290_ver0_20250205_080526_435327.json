    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 22-year-old Black female with specific characteristics.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors provided:\n\n- Age: 22\n\n- Gender: Female\n\n- Race: Black\n\n- Arrests: 1 time, no conviction\n\n- Height: 5'5\"\n\n- Weight: 158 lbs\n\n- Marital status: Never married, living alone\n\n- Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college\n\n- Employment: Held 3 jobs in the past year\n\n- Drug use: No drugs in the past four years\n\n- Mental health: Some days in the past month felt down, nothing could cheer her up\n\n- Household size at a young age: 2\n\n- Religious belief: Believes God has something to do with personal events\n\nNow, I need to consider how these factors relate to risk assessment in criminal justice. Risk assessment typically looks at factors that may predict future criminal behavior or recidivism.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Age**: 22 is relatively young. Statistically, younger individuals may have higher tendencies towards certain types of crime, but this isn't universally true.\n\n2. **Gender**: Females generally have lower rates of criminal activity compared to males.\n\n3. **Race**: Race should not be a determining factor in risk assessment. It's important to approach this without racial bias.\n\n4. **Arrests and convictions**: One arrest with no conviction is somewhat neutral. It could indicate a minor infraction or a misunderstanding.\n\n5. **Physical attributes**: Height and weight are unlikely to be relevant to risk assessment.\n\n6. **Marital status and living situation**: Living alone might be neutral, but some assessments consider stability in living situations.\n\n7. **Education**: High school diploma and not enrolled in college is neutral. Educational attainment can sometimes correlate with lower risk.\n\n8. **Employment**: Holding three jobs in a year might suggest instability in employment, which could be a risk factor.\n\n9. **Drug use**: No drug use in the past four years is positive.\n\n10. **Mental health**: Feeling down some days could indicate mild depression or stress, which might require attention but isn't necessarily a direct risk factor for criminal behavior.\n\n11. **Household size at a young age**: Growing up in a two-person household could be neutral or might suggest a certain family structure.\n\n12. **Religious belief**: Belief in God's influence on personal events might indicate a sense of morality or community support.\n\nOverall, most of these factors don't strongly indicate high risk. The employment instability could be a minor concern, but overall, the profile seems low risk.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 85%.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"NO\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\nI'm confident in this assessment based on the provided factors.\n\n",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year.

At a young age, she lived in a household of size 2. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
