    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 19-year-old male identified as White. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, he's 19, which is young. Statistics show that younger individuals tend to be more impulsive and are at higher risk for certain types of criminal behavior. But age alone isn't everything; there are other factors to consider.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's interesting. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean he's guilty, but it does suggest some level of involvement with the law. Maybe it was a minor offense, or perhaps it was a misunderstanding. Hard to say without more context, but it's still a mark on his record.\n\nPhysically, he's 5'8\" and weighs 140 lbs. Not sure how this directly relates to risk assessment, but body type and health can sometimes be indicators of other issues. For example, if someone is underweight, it might suggest substance abuse or other problems. But again, without more information, it's hard to make a direct connection.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because lack of social support may lead to poorer decision-making. However, many people live alone successfully without any issues. So, this is something to consider but not necessarily a red flag on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be significant; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates. But he has completed high school, which is positive. Not being in college could mean he's focusing on his career or other pursuits, which isn't inherently risky.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability is generally a good sign, indicating responsibility and reliability. Holding multiple jobs might suggest financial pressures or a strong work ethic. Either way, employment is usually a positive factor.\n\nNow, substance use: he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. This is a significant red flag. Substance abuse is closely linked to criminal behavior. Cocaine, in particular, is a powerful drug associated with higher risks of offending and reoffending. Marijuana use, while less severe, still indicates some level of involvement with illegal substances.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is good. Mental health issues can be risk factors for criminal behavior, so the absence of depression is positive.\n\nLooking back at his childhood, he lived with both biological parents in a rural area in a household of four. Family stability is generally beneficial, and living with both parents can be protective against delinquency. Rural areas may have different crime rates and social dynamics compared to urban areas, but it's hard to generalize.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing moral guidance and a support system. However, this isn't always the case, and some individuals may interpret their beliefs in ways that justify harmful behaviors.\n\nOverall, considering these factors, there are both positive and negative indicators. The substance use, especially cocaine, is a major concern. His employment history and educational attainment are positive signs. His age is a bit of a wildcard, as youth can be associated with higher risk-taking.\n\nGiven all this, I would predict that he presents a higher than average risk, but not extremely high. Maybe around 70% confidence in classifying him as high risk due to the substance use history, despite some positive aspects like employment and education.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```\n",
