    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 22-year-old female. Let's see what we're working with here.\n\nFirst off, she's White, 22 years old, and identifies as female. Physical attributes: 5'7\" and 155 lbs. She's been arrested once but not convicted, which is interesting. Education-wise, she has a Bachelor's degree but isn't currently enrolled in college. Employment history shows she's held four jobs in the past year, which seems like a lot of turnover.\n\nPersonal life: never married, living alone. Substance use is a concern\u2014she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recently, within the past month, she's been feeling pretty down, to the point where nothing could cheer her up. That sounds like significant depression.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area, household size of four. Her religious view is that God has nothing to do with personal events, which might indicate a secular outlook or perhaps a lack of coping mechanisms during tough times.\n\nOkay, let's think about this from a risk assessment perspective. The fact that she's been arrested but not convicted could suggest some involvement in risky behaviors, but without a conviction, it's hard to gauge the severity. However, the arrest itself is a red flag.\n\nThe job turnover is notable. Holding four jobs in a year might indicate instability or perhaps difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor for further legal issues or other problems.\n\nSubstance use is a major concern. Using marijuana and cocaine, especially recently, increases the risk of relapse, involvement in illegal activities, or other associated risks like impaired judgment or health issues.\n\nHer recent depressive feelings are also significant. Severe depression can impair decision-making, increase vulnerability to substance abuse, and may even lead to suicidal thoughts or actions.\n\nGrowing up with both parents in an urban area might not be inherently risky, but depending on the neighborhood and family dynamics, there could be associated risks. Her secular view might or might not be relevant, but it could suggest a lack of social support from religious communities, which some people find helpful during tough times.\n\nOverall, considering the arrest history, job instability, substance use, and recent depressive symptoms, I would predict that this individual is at high risk for further issues, possibly including re-arrest, substance abuse problems, or mental health crises.\n\nBut I need to provide this in a specific JSON format. Let's do that.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n\nI'm giving a \"YES\" for high risk with a confidence of 85%. The multiple risk factors, especially the recent substance use and depressive symptoms, strongly suggest a high-risk profile.\n",
