    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk, and I need to respond with a specific JSON format. Let's see, the person in question is a 22-year-old white female, arrested twice, convicted, height 5'7\", weight 135 lbs, never married, living alone, high school diploma, not in college, had five jobs in a year, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, no depression in the last month, lived in a household of three when young, and believes God influences personal events.\n\nFirst off, I need to consider what constitutes \"high risk\" in this context. Since it's a criminal justice risk assessment, I'm assuming we're looking at the likelihood of reoffending or engaging in harmful behavior. So, I'll need to weigh these factors based on their relevance to recidivism or potential for future criminal activity.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: 22-year-old female. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males, and younger ages might suggest more impulsivity but also greater potential for rehabilitation.\n\n2. **Arrest and Conviction History**: Arrested twice, convicted. This suggests some history of criminal behavior, which is a significant risk factor.\n\n3. **Marital Status and Living Situation**: Never married, living alone. Living alone could sometimes be associated with higher risk if there's lack of social support, but it's not always conclusive.\n\n4. **Education and Employment**: High school diploma, not in college, five jobs in a year. Frequent job changes can indicate instability, which might be a risk factor.\n\n5. **Substance Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially harder substances like cocaine, is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: No depression in the last month. That's positive, but history of mental health issues could still be a factor.\n\n7. **Family Background**: Lived in a household of three when young. Not sure if this is relevant unless there's information about family dynamics or stability.\n\n8. **Spirituality**: Believes God influences personal events. Spirituality can sometimes be a protective factor, but it depends on how it influences behavior.\n\nConsidering these factors, the arrest and conviction history, along with the drug use, particularly cocaine, are significant red flags. The frequent job changes also suggest instability, which could be a risk factor. However, the fact that she hasn't experienced depression recently is positive, and her belief in God might provide some moral guidance.\n\nBut overall, the combination of criminal history, drug use, and employment instability tips the scale towards higher risk.\n\nI need to provide a confidence level between 0 and 100. Given the notable risk factors, I'll say 85%.\n\nSo, my JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\{\"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 85\\}} \\]",
