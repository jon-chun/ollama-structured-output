    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this set of risk factors to analyze for a 19-year-old female. Let's see what we're dealing with here.\n\nFirst off, she's Hispanic, 19 years old, and female. In general, younger age is often associated with higher risk because impulsivity and lack of maturity can lead to poor decision-making. However, being female typically correlates with lower criminality rates compared to males. So, there's a bit of a balancing act there.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's something to consider. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean she committed a crime, but it does suggest that law enforcement had enough suspicion to make an arrest. On the other hand, no conviction means that there wasn't sufficient evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nHer physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment, unless perhaps in specific contexts like violent offenses, but generally, these aren't major factors.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor because there might be less social support and supervision. However, this isn't always the case, and many people live alone without any issues.\n\nEducation-wise, she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, and she's not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a significant predictor of recidivism. Lower education levels are often linked to higher rates of criminal behavior because of limited job opportunities and lower earning potential.\n\nEmployment history: she's held only one job in the past year. Instability in employment can be a risk factor, as consistent employment is associated with lower recidivism rates. Job instability might indicate difficulties in maintaining employment or a lack of commitment to stable work.\n\nDrug use: she has used marijuana in the past four years and has had periods in the last month where she felt persistently down. Substance abuse and mental health issues are both strong predictors of criminal behavior and recidivism. Marijuana use, while illegal in many places, is less severe than harder drugs, but any drug use can indicate potential for other risky behaviors. The depressive symptoms are also concerning, as mental health struggles can lead to self-medication with drugs or engagement in criminal activities.\n\nHer living situation as a child: she lived with adults who weren't her biological, foster, or adoptive parents in an urban area. This could suggest instability in her childhood home, which is a known risk factor for future delinquency. A stable home environment is crucial for healthy development, and disruptions can have lasting effects.\n\nLastly, her view on religion: she believes God has nothing to do with personal events. Religious involvement can be a protective factor against criminal behavior, as it often provides moral guidance and social support. Lack of religious engagement might mean she doesn't have those benefits.\n\nOverall, several risk factors stand out: young age, arrest history, low educational attainment, unstable employment, drug use, depressive symptoms, childhood instability, and lack of religious involvement. These collectively paint a picture of someone at higher risk for future criminal behavior.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that risk assessments should be holistic, considering both risks and protective factors. But based on the information provided, the risks seem predominant.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES,\" indicating high risk, with a confidence level of 85%.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
