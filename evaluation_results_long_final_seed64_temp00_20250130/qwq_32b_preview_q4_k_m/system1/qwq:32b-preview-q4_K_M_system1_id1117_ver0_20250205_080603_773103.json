    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk, and I need to respond with a specific JSON format. Let's see, the person is a 21-year-old black male, arrested twice but no convictions yet. He's 5'8\" and weighs 161 lbs, living alone, never married, no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, no job in the last year. He has used cocaine in the past four years and has been feeling down lately. Growing up, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four, and he doesn't believe God affects personal events.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to consider each of these factors and see how they relate to risk assessment in criminal justice. Let's start with demographic information. Age is 21, which is young, and statistics show that younger individuals are more likely to be involved in criminal activities. Being male also tends to correlate with higher crime rates compared to females. Race is another factor; unfortunately, there are disparities in the criminal justice system, with minorities often facing disproportionate treatment.\n\nNow, arrest history: twice arrested but no convictions. This could suggest that either the charges were dropped, or he was found not guilty. Regardless, multiple arrests indicate some level of involvement with the legal system, which is a risk factor.\n\nEducational background: no high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is often linked to higher crime rates, as it limits employment opportunities.\n\nEmployment: no jobs in the last year. Unemployment can lead to engagement in criminal activities due to financial pressures and lack of structured daily routines.\n\nSubstance abuse: cocaine use in the past four years and recent feelings of depression. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors for criminal behavior, as they can impair judgment and lead to desperate actions.\n\nUpbringing: lived with biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Family structure and environment can influence behavioral outcomes. Living in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates and peer pressure.\n\nLastly, his view on religion: believes God has nothing to do with personal events. While religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and support, the absence of such beliefs doesn't necessarily indicate higher risk. However, lack of community support from religious institutions might be a factor.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like there are several red flags here. Young age, male gender, minority status, arrest history, lack of education, unemployment, substance abuse, and mental health issues are all significant risk factors. The only mitigating factor might be that he hasn't been convicted yet, but the arrests suggest some level of involvement in illegal activities.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would predict high risk. But I need to provide a confidence level between 0 and 100. Considering the multiple risk factors and their severity, I'll go with a high confidence level, say 90%.\n\nSo, my JSON response will be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 90\n\n}\n\nBut before finalizing, let me think if there's anything else I should consider. Is there any positive aspect here that might lower the risk? Hmm, he's living alone, which could be either positive or negative. On one hand, it might mean he's independent, but on the other hand, lack of social support could be a risk factor.\n\nAlso, his height and weight don't seem directly relevant to the risk assessment, so I'll disregard those for now.\n\nAlright, I think my initial assessment stands. High risk with 90% confidence.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\{\"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 90\\}} \\]\n",
