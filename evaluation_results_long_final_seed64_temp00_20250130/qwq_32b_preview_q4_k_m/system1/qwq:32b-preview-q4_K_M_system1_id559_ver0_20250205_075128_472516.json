    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is an 18-year-old male, white, arrested three times, convicted, height 6'1\", weight 215 lbs, never married, living alone, high school diploma, not in college, held two jobs in the past year, used marijuana in the last four years, and has had feelings of depression recently. Also, he grew up in a household of seven and believes God influences personal events.\n\nFirst off, I need to consider what these risk factors might imply in terms of future criminal behavior or recidivism. As a risk assessment expert, I'm familiar with various models and statistical indicators that help predict such outcomes. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with demographic information: male, 18 years old, white. Gender and age are known risk factors; males are generally more likely to commit crimes, especially at younger ages. Race can also be a factor, but it's important to approach this sensitively and ensure that any considerations are based on data and not biases.\n\nNext, arrest and conviction history: three arrests and at least one conviction. A history of criminal behavior is a strong predictor of future offenses. The number of prior arrests and convictions typically correlates with higher risk.\n\nPhysical attributes: height and weight. These might not be directly relevant to risk assessment unless there are specific contexts where physical size could be a factor, such as in certain types of crimes.\n\nMarital status and living situation: never married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk, as social supports are thought to have a protective effect.\n\nEducation: high school diploma, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to criminal behavior; higher education generally correlates with lower risk.\n\nEmployment: held two jobs in the past year. Stable employment is typically seen as a positive factor, reducing the likelihood of criminal activity. However, holding multiple jobs could indicate financial pressures or other issues that might influence behavior.\n\nSubstance use: marijuana use in the past four years, and recent feelings of depression. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors. Marijuana use, in particular, has been linked to increased risk of certain types of criminal behavior, especially when combined with other factors like depression.\n\nFamily background: lived in a large household with seven members. Household size might not be directly relevant, but family environment and structure can influence individual behavior.\n\nReligious beliefs: believes God influences personal events. Religious affiliation or belief can sometimes be a protective factor, as it may provide moral guidance and social support.\n\nNow, synthesizing all these factors:\n\n- Negative factors: male, young age, multiple arrests and convictions, substance use, depression, living alone.\n\n- Positive factors: white (depending on the context), high school diploma, held jobs.\n\nGiven that he has a history of arrests and convictions, combined with recent substance use and mental health issues, these are substantial red flags. The fact that he's living alone might also reduce social supports that could help mitigate risk.\n\nHowever, he has completed high school and has been employed, which are positive signs. But considering the severity of the other risk factors, particularly the combination of criminal history, substance use, and mental health issues, I would lean towards predicting high risk.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'd say around 85%. The strong indicators are the criminal history and the presence of both substance use and depression, which are known to increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence of 85.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
