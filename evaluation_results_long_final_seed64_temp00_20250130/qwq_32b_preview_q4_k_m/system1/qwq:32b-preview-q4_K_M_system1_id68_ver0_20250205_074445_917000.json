    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 20-year-old white female with a few specific characteristics that I need to consider.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a significant point because having a criminal record is often associated with higher recidivism rates. So, that ticks a box for potential high risk.\n\nShe's living alone, which could be a factor depending on the context. Living alone might mean less social support, which could potentially lead to higher risk behaviors. However, this isn't always the case, so I'll consider it as a moderate risk indicator.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, and she's not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is closely linked to employment opportunities and overall stability, so lacking formal education could indicate higher risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Frequent job changes can sometimes suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be related to higher risk behaviors.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor. She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has recent symptoms of depression. Substance abuse and mental health issues are strongly correlated with criminal behavior and recidivism.\n\nHer background includes living with her biological mother in a household of three, and she believes that God has nothing to do with personal events. This information about her upbringing and spiritual beliefs might indicate a lack of traditional support systems, which could be relevant to risk assessment.\n\nConsidering all these factors, particularly the criminal history, educational level, employment instability, substance abuse, and mental health issues, it seems like there are multiple indicators pointing towards high risk.\n\nI would predict \"YES\" for high risk. As for confidence, given the presence of several significant risk factors, I'd say 85%.\n\nSo, the JSON response would be:\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\nBut I should double-check if there's anything here that might suggest low risk. For example, her age\u201420\u2014isn't extremely young, and being female, there might be lower general risk associated with that demographic. However, given her specific circumstances, I still think high risk is the appropriate prediction.\n\n**Final JSON Response:**\n\n{\n\n\"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n\"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n",
