    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk, and I need to respond with a specific JSON format. Let's see, the person is a 20-year-old white male, arrested 5 times and convicted. He's tall, about 6'3\", weighs between 200 and 224 lbs, lives alone, never married, no high school diploma or GED, only held one job in the past year, no drug use in the last four years, not depressed recently, lived with his bio mom in an urban area in a household of three, and he doesn't believe God has anything to do with personal events.\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to think about what typically indicates high risk in criminal justice contexts. Things like prior arrests and convictions are big red flags. The number of arrests is five, and he's been convicted, which suggests a pattern of offending behavior. Age is 20, which is still relatively young, but combined with the arrest history, it's concerning.\n\nHis educational background is weak; no high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Education levels are often correlated with lower recidivism rates, so lacking formal education could be a risk factor.\n\nEmployment history is also sketchy; only one job in the past year. Stability in employment is generally seen as positive, so frequent job changes or unemployment can indicate higher risk.\n\nOn the plus side, he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is good. Substance abuse is a significant factor in many crimes, so his abstinence from drugs is a positive note.\n\nHe hasn't been depressed recently, which is also favorable. Mental health issues can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, so his current mental state seems stable.\n\nHis living situation\u2014living alone, never married\u2014might be neutral or slightly risky, depending on the context. Social support systems can be important in rehabilitation, so lacking a spouse or family cohabitation could be a consideration.\n\nHis belief in God's personal influence might not have much direct bearing on risk assessment, unless it's part of a broader set of cultural or behavioral indicators.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the prior arrests and convictions, lack of education, and limited employment history are significant red flags. However, his abstention from drugs and absence of recent depression are positive points.\n\nI need to make a prediction: yes or no for high risk, and a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nGiven the arrest and conviction history, coupled with educational and employment deficiencies, I'm inclined to say yes, this indicates high risk. But I should consider that he hasn't used drugs recently and isn't depressed, which are positives.\n\nMaybe a balanced view would be that the positive factors somewhat mitigate the negatives, but the arrest and conviction history is still pretty\u91cd, so overall, I'd probably predict high risk with perhaps 70% confidence.\n\nWait, but five arrests and convictions at age 20 is quite serious. That suggests a pattern of offending behavior that might be hard to break without intervention.\n\nAlternatively, maybe giving him the benefit of the doubt for his recent clean slate regarding drugs and mental health, but honestly, the arrest record is pretty damning.\n\nI think I'll go with \"YES\" for high risk, and maybe 80% confidence.\n\nBut let's see, is there any other angle I should consider? His height and weight\u20146'3\", 200-224 lbs\u2014does that matter? Probably not directly related to risk level.\n\nLiving alone\u2014could be neutral or slightly risky, as social support is important.\n\nNever married\u2014again, maybe neutral in terms of risk.\n\nHis childhood living situation\u2014living with bio mom in an urban area, household size three. Not sure how much that factors into current risk assessment.\n\nAnd his view on God's personal influence\u2014probably not directly relevant.\n\nSo, overall, I think the strongest indicators are the prior arrests and convictions, lack of education, and limited employment history. The positives are not using drugs and not being depressed recently.\n\nGiven that, I'll stick with \"YES\" for high risk and 80% confidence.\n\n**Final Prediction**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```\n",
