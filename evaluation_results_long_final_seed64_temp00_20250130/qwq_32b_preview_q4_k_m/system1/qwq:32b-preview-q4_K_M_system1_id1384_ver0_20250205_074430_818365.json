    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is a 19-year-old female identifying as American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. Let's see...\n\nFirst, she's 19 years old. In criminal justice risk assessment, age can be a factor because younger individuals might be more impulsive or still developing their decision-making skills. However, 19 is relatively close to adulthood, so maybe not as high\u98ce\u9669 as someone younger, say, 16 or 17.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests don't necessarily mean she's guilty of anything, but multiple arrests could indicate some level of involvement in activities that lead to police attention. But since there are no convictions, it's possible that these were unfounded or she was not charged.\n\nHer physical attributes\u20145'5\" and 140 lbs\u2014don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment unless there's specific context suggesting otherwise.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse, which could be a positive sign. Stable relationships often correlate with lower recidivism rates because there are supportive networks and responsibilities that might deter involvement in criminal activities.\n\nLack of high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college could be a risk factor. Education level is often correlated with employment opportunities and overall life stability. Lower education levels can sometimes lead to higher risks of engaging in criminal behavior due to limited options.\n\nHolding only one job during the year might not be entirely negative, but consistent employment is generally seen as positive. However, if she's had only one job in a year, it could suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a concern.\n\nDrug use\u2014specifically marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and recent feelings of depression\u2014 are significant risk factors. Substance abuse and mental health issues are strongly linked to criminal behavior. The use of harder drugs like cocaine is particularly concerning.\n\nHer background living with her biological mother in a rural area in a household of three might not be directly indicative of risk, but family environment and community can play roles in an individual's behavior. Rural areas sometimes have different challenges regarding access to resources and support systems.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has something to do with personal events could be seen in different ways. Some might see it as a positive coping mechanism or source of support, while others might consider it irrelevant or even a potential for extremism, depending on the context.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of drug use, especially harder drugs, combined with recent depressive symptoms and lack of education, suggests a\u8f83\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5979\u7684\u5a5a\u59fb\u548c\u4e0e\u914d\u5076\u540c\u4f4f\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u6211\u9700\u8981\u7efc\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u505a\u51fa\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u6211\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u662f\u201cYES\u201d\uff0c\u8868\u793a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u4fe1\u5fc3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u662f\u6ee1\u5206\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6709\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u662f\u6b63\u9762\u7684\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u5a5a\u59fb\u72b6\u51b5\u3002\u4e5f\u8bb8\u4fe1\u5fc3 level \u662f85%\u5427\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u7684JSON\u54cd\u5e94\u5c06\u662f\uff1a\n\n{\n\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n\n  \"confidence\": 85\n\n}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{ \\{\"prediction\": \"YES\", \"confidence\": 85\\} } \\]",
