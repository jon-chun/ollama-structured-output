    "raw_message_text": "Alright, I've got this task to analyze some risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. I need to respond with a JSON object that has a \"prediction\" of either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a \"confidence\" level between 0 and 100. The person in question is an 18-year-old male, white, arrested 10 times, convicted, height 5'10\", weight 160 lbs, never married, not living alone, no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, held one job in the past year, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the last four years, no depression in the past month, lived in a household of three when young, and believes God has personal influence in his life.\n\nFirst off, I need to consider the number of arrests and convictions. Ten arrests is a significant number for an 18-year-old. That suggests a pattern of involvement in criminal activity. Convictions reinforce that he's not just being arrested but also found guilty, which indicates a higher risk.\n\nHis education level is low; no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is often correlated with lower recidivism rates because it can lead to better job opportunities and a sense of purpose outside of crime. So, lacking education is a risk factor.\n\nEmployment history is also weak; only one job in the past year. Stability in employment is important for reducing criminal behavior. Frequent job changes or unemployment can lead to more opportunities for criminal activity.\n\nDrug use is another major red flag. Using marijuana and cocaine in the last four years suggests possible addiction or at least a pattern of substance abuse, which is closely linked to criminal behavior. Substance abuse can both cause and be a result of involvement in crime.\n\nLiving situation: not living alone, which could be positive or negative. If he's living with supportive family members, that might be helpful, but without more information, it's hard to assess.\n\nMarital status: never married, which isn't necessarily a risk factor, but some studies show that being married can reduce criminal behavior, possibly due to increased responsibilities and social ties.\n\nBelief in God's personal influence could be relevant. Some research suggests that strong religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against crime, providing moral guidance and community support. However, this is not always the case, and it depends on how his beliefs influence his behaviors.\n\nHeight and weight are probably irrelevant unless there's some specific context where physical attributes relate to risk.\n\nHousehold size when young: lived in a household of three. Again, without more information about the household dynamics, it's hard to interpret this.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the multiple arrests and convictions, lack of education, limited employment history, drug use, and young age all point towards a high risk of future criminal behavior. The belief in God's personal influence could be a mitigating factor, but given the other risk factors, it might not be sufficient to outweigh them.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"YES,\" indicating high risk, with a confidence level of, say, 85%. That seems reasonable given the significant number of risk factors present.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```\n",
