He has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 3.
