Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse.
