He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
