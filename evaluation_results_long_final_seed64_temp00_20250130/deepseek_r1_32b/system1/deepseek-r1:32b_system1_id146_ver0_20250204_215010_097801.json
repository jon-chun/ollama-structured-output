    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old female and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White. I'm not sure how race plays into risk assessments, but maybe it could influence certain biases or systemic issues, though that might be more about societal context than individual risk.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That seems significant because prior convictions are often strong indicators of recidivism. The fact that she's been arrested multiple times suggests a pattern of behavior that could lead to future offenses.\n\nHer height and weight\u20145'7\" and 135 lbs\u2014I don't think those physical attributes directly correlate with risk, unless maybe in certain contexts like violent crimes, but without more info, I can't say they're relevant here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a factor. Not being married isn't necessarily a red flag on its own, but combined with other factors, it might contribute to higher risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level can be a factor; lower education might correlate with higher unemployment rates, which can sometimes lead to criminal activity. However, she's held five jobs in the past year, which shows some work ethic but also job instability, which could indicate issues maintaining consistent employment.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor because it can impair judgment, lead to dependency, and sometimes correlate with other criminal activities to sustain drug habits.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's positive; mental health issues like depression can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors when untreated, so her current state might lower that particular risk.\n\nShe grew up in a household of size 3. Family environment can influence behavior, but without knowing more about the family dynamics or stability, it's hard to assess this factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. This could indicate a strong moral compass or support system through religion, which might mitigate risk by providing structure and purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: prior convictions, multiple arrests, substance abuse, living alone, job instability\u2014these factors seem to point towards higher risk. The lack of depression and belief in God might slightly lower the risk, but the other factors are more significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
