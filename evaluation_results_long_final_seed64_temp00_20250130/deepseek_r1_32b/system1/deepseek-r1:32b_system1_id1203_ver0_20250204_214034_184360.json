    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing decision-making skills. Race could also play a role in systemic issues affecting risk assessment, though I should be cautious not to let bias influence the analysis.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has convictions. That's a significant point. Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that could indicate higher risk for reoffending or engaging in further criminal activity.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight is 165 lbs. I'm not sure how this directly affects risk, but maybe it relates to physical presence or potential for certain types of crimes. Not a major factor on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor. However, some people manage well living alone, so I need to consider this in context with other factors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to employment opportunities and stability. Lack of education can contribute to higher risk if it leads to limited job prospects and potential involvement in criminal activities as a means of income.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. That suggests some level of employability but only part-time or inconsistent work might not provide enough financial stability, which could be a stressor leading to risky behavior.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) and recent feelings of depression (\"so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up\"). Substance use can impair judgment and increase impulsivity. Depression is another mental health issue that might affect decision-making and coping mechanisms, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of five. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but family dynamics also play a role. A larger household might mean less individual attention or more stressors contributing to behavioral issues.\n\nConsiders that God has something to do with personal events. This could indicate some level of spirituality or belief system which might provide support and reduce risk if it encourages positive behavior. However, without knowing how this belief is applied, it's hard to assess its impact on risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests/convictions, lack of education, limited employment, substance use, depression symptoms, living alone. These factors collectively suggest a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior or other negative outcomes. The confidence level would be high because several significant risk indicators are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
