    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Hispanic. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally. Being male also statistically correlates with higher crime rates, though this varies widely.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant point. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism. The fact that he's already been through the criminal justice system suggests some level of risk.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight is 185 lbs. Physically, this doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there's a history of violence or other related factors, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk because there might be less supervision or support. However, it's not a definitive factor on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates. Without formal education, he may face challenges finding stable employment, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nHe held five jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes could indicate instability, difficulty maintaining employment, or possible issues with authority figures at work. This might suggest problems with consistent behavior or reliability.\n\nDrug use within the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment, lead to dependency, and increase involvement in criminal activities to sustain drug use.\n\nHe's felt down for some of the past month, indicating possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health problems can contribute to risky behaviors if not addressed properly.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of six. Family structure is important; living with both parents usually provides more stability. However, being in an urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates or influences.\n\nHe considers God significant in his personal life. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against criminal behavior, but it's not always the case and depends on how this belief translates into actions.\n\nPutting all these together: arrest history, convictions, substance abuse, mental health issues, lack of education, job instability, living alone\u2014all point towards higher risk factors. The presence of multiple indicators suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism or engaging in further criminal activity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
