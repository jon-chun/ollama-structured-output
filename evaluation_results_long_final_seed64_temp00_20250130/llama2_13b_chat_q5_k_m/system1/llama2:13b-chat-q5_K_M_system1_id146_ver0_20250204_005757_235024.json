Firstly, the individual is a young female with no prior convictions for violent crimes. Additionally, she has never been married and is currently living alone, which suggests that she may have fewer opportunities for negative influences in her life. Furthermore, she has held five jobs during the year, which indicates stability and responsibility.\n\nHowever, there are also some risk factors present. The individual has a history of drug use, which could potentially lead to future criminal behavior. Additionally, her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally may indicate a lack of accountability for her actions.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present, the combination of these factors suggests a low risk of recidivism. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 60%.",
