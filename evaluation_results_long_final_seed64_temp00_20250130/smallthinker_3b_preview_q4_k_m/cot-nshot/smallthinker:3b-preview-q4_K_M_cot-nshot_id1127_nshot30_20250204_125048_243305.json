    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case of a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 4 times and convicted, weighs between 200 and 224 lbs, has never been married, lives alone, holds a high school diploma, and has used marijuana in the past four years. Additionally, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested 4 times and convicted. This is a significant factor. Let me assign it a high weight.\n2. **Age at First Arrest**: The age range isn't specified, so I'll assume he was around 18-20 when first arrested. This could be medium.\n3. **Conviction History**: He has been convicted multiple times. This is also a high factor.\n4. **Weight Range**: The weight range is between 200 and 224 lbs. This might be low to medium, as it's not directly related to criminal behavior.\n5. **Marital Status**: Never married. This could be low.\n6. **Living Situation**: Lives alone. This might also be low.\n7. **Education Level**: High school diploma. This is low.\n8. **Drug Use History**: Used marijuana in the past four years. This is medium.\n9. **Belief in Divine Intervention**: This is low.\n\nNow, let me assign these weights based on their impact:\n\n- Arrest History: High\n- Age at First Arrest: Medium\n- Conviction History: High\n- Weight Range: Low\n- Marital Status: Low\n- Living Situation: Low\n- Education Level: Low\n- Drug Use History: Medium\n- Belief in Divine Intervention: Low\n\nLet me check the instruction again to ensure I'm on the right track. The weights seem reasonable, so I'll proceed with this analysis.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a high likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age at First Arrest\", \"medium\", \"The age range is not specified, but assuming he was around 18-20 when first arrested suggests a medium level of risk.\"),\n    (\"Conviction History\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions suggest a high level of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Weight Range\", \"low\", \"The weight range does not directly impact criminal behavior, so it is assigned a low weight.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married is not directly related to criminal behavior, so it is assigned a low weight.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Lives alone is not directly related to criminal behavior, so it is assigned a low weight.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma does not indicate a high level of risk for recidivism, so it is assigned a low weight.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years suggests some level of substance use, but not directly related to criminal behavior, so it is assigned a medium weight.\"),\n    (\"Belief in Divine Intervention\", \"low\", \"This belief does not directly impact criminal behavior, so it is assigned a low weight.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
