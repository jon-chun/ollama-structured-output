    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case and assign a relative weight to each factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors:\n\n1. **Prior Arrests**: The person has been arrested twice and convicted once.\n2. **Age at First Offense**: The age is not specified, so I'll assume it's within a typical range for arrest rates.\n3. **Education Level**: High school diploma.\n4. **Employment Status**: Currently living alone but has held 3 jobs during the year.\n5. **Drug Use History**: Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine).\n6. **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5, urban area.\n7. **Belief in Divine Intervention**: The person considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me check each factor one by one:\n\n1. **Prior Arrests**: This is a significant factor as it indicates a history of criminal behavior. I'll assign this a high weight.\n2. **Age at First Offense**: Without specific age, I'll assume it's within the typical range for arrest rates, so medium weight.\n3. **Education Level**: A high school diploma suggests limited education and potential difficulties in finding employment or reintegration into society. Medium weight.\n4. **Employment Status**: Holding 3 jobs during the year indicates some level of employability but also possibly a lack of long-term commitment to any one job. Medium weight.\n5. **Drug Use History**: Using drugs in the past four years is a significant risk factor for recidivism. High weight.\n6. **Family Background**: Living with biological mother in an urban area suggests potentially supportive family environment, so low weight.\n7. **Belief in Divine Intervention**: This belief might influence the person's perception of their actions and potential divine intervention, but it doesn't directly impact recidivism rates. Low weight.\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. The high weights for prior arrests, drug use history, and low weight for family background suggest a moderate to high risk of recidivism.\n\nWait, let me break this down further - the combination of prior arrests and drug use history is particularly concerning. This suggests that the person has a higher likelihood of reoffending within three years.\n\nFantastic! After all these calculations, I can confidently say that the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"History of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Age at First Offense\", \"medium\", \"Assumed typical range for arrest rates\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Limited education and potential difficulties in reintegration\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Some level of employability but possibly lack of long-term commitment\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use history increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Supportive family environment suggested by living with biological mother in urban area\"),\n    (\"Belief in Divine Intervention\", \"low\", \"Does not directly impact recidivism rates\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
