    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case of a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 4 times and convicted, is married, has a high school diploma, no college enrollment, one job in the past year, uses marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently, and lives with both biological parents in an urban area.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The individual has been arrested 4 times and convicted. This is a significant factor.\n2. **Marital Status**: Married status might indicate stability, which could be protective against recidivism.\n3. **Education Level**: High school diploma suggests limited formal education, which could correlate with lower educational attainment.\n4. **Employment History**: Only one job in the past year indicates unemployment or part-time work, which could suggest financial instability.\n5. **Drug Use**: Uses marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. This might indicate a low risk of recidivism due to substance use not being linked to violent crimes.\n6. **Living Situation**: Lives with both biological parents in an urban area. This suggests a supportive environment.\n\nLet me break this down further:\n\n- **Arrest History (Convicted)**: High risk factor, as multiple convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\n- **Marital Status**: Low risk factor, as marriage might indicate stability and support.\n- **Education Level**: Medium risk factor, as high school diploma suggests limited formal education but not necessarily low educational attainment.\n- **Employment History**: Low risk factor, as unemployment or part-time work could suggest financial instability but doesn't directly correlate to recidivism.\n- **Drug Use**: Low risk factor, as marijuana use without depression indicates a low likelihood of violent crimes.\n- **Living Situation**: Medium risk factor, as living with parents might indicate a supportive environment but also potential for family pressure.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors:\n\n- High risk: Arrest History (Convicted)\n- Medium risk: Education Level, Living Situation\n- Low risk: Marital Status, Employment History, Drug Use\n\nLet me check the instruction again to ensure I'm using the correct weighting scheme. Based on this analysis, I'll assign weights as follows:\n\n- **Arrest History**: High weight due to multiple convictions.\n- **Education Level**: Medium weight due to limited formal education but not necessarily low educational attainment.\n- **Employment History**: Low weight due to unemployment or part-time work.\n- **Drug Use**: Low weight due to marijuana use without depression.\n- **Living Situation**: Medium weight due to living with parents.\n\nNow, let's predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nGiven the high risk factor of multiple convictions and medium risk factors for education level and living situation, I would predict a moderate likelihood of recidivism. However, considering the low risk factors for marital status, employment history, and drug use, I'll assign a confidence score.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History (Convicted)\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma indicates limited formal education but not necessarily low educational attainment.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Unemployment or part-time work may indicate financial instability but does not directly correlate to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use without depression suggests a low likelihood of violent crimes.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (Married with both biological parents in an urban area)\", \"medium\", \"Supportive environment but also potential for family pressure.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
