    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the case details:\n- The person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White.\n- He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n- His height is 6 feet 0 inches and weight is 204 lbs.\n- He has never been married and is currently not living alone.\n- He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.\n- He has held 4 jobs during the year.\n- He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine).\n- At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area.\n- He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nNow, let's assign weights to each factor based on the analysis of the n-shot examples:\n\n1. Arrest History: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This suggests some level of risk, so I'll assign a medium weight.\n2. Age and Living Situation: Being 20 years old and not living with parents indicates some independence, which might reduce the risk slightly. So, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n3. Education Level: Having a GED certificate suggests he has completed high school or equivalent, which is positive. Therefore, I'll assign a medium weight.\n4. Employment Status: Holding 4 jobs during the year indicates some level of employment stability, so I'll assign a medium weight.\n5. Drug Use: Using drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) suggests a higher risk, so I'll assign a high weight.\n6. Living Environment: Growing up with his biological mother in an urban area might indicate some environmental factors at play, but it's not directly related to recidivism. So, I'll assign a low weight.\n7. Belief in God's Influence: Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a higher risk due to potential lack of accountability or support systems. Therefore, I'll assign a high weight.\n\nNow, let's use these weights to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- Arrest History (medium): Medium\n- Age and Living Situation (low): Low\n- Education Level (medium): Medium\n- Employment Status (medium): Medium\n- Drug Use (high): High\n- Living Environment (low): Low\n- Belief in God's Influence (high): High\n\nCollectively, the risk factors suggest a high likelihood of rearrest recidivism. Therefore, I'll predict \"YES\" with a confidence level of 80.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned based on the person's history of arrest but not conviction.\"),\n    (\"Age and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as the person is 20 years old and not living with parents, indicating some independence.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned as he has a GED certificate, suggesting completion of high school or equivalent.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned as he holds 4 jobs during the year, indicating some level of employment stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to his use of drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), suggesting a higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Environment\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as the person grew up with his biological mother in an urban area, but this factor is not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally, suggesting a higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
