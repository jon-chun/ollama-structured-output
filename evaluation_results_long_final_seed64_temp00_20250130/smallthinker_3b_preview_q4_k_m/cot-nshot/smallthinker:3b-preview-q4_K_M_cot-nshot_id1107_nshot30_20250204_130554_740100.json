    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case and assign a relative weight to each factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the risk factors:\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 19 years old.\n2. **Arrest History**: He has been arrested 2 times but not convicted.\n3. **Weight**: He weighs 280 lbs.\n4. **Marital Status**: He is married and currently living with his spouse.\n5. **Education**: He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.\n6. **Job History**: He has held 5 jobs during the year.\n7. **Drug Use**: He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine).\n8. **Family Background**: He lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area.\n\nNow, let me think about how to assign weights to these factors:\n\n1. **Age**: Being younger might indicate more potential for change and rehabilitation.\n2. **Arrest History**: Multiple arrests without conviction could suggest some level of risk but also resilience.\n3. **Weight**: A higher weight might be assigned due to the physical aspect, though it's not directly related to criminal behavior.\n4. **Marital Status**: Being married could indicate a stable environment that might reduce crime risk.\n5. **Education**: Lack of education and no college enrollment suggests potential for further development but also increased risk factors.\n6. **Job History**: Holding multiple jobs might suggest employment stability, reducing the likelihood of crime.\n7. **Drug Use**: Using drugs is a significant risk factor.\n8. **Family Background**: Living with both biological parents in an urban area could indicate a supportive environment.\n\nLet me check the instruction again to ensure I'm on the right track. The weights should be assigned based on how strongly each factor influences the outcome. Here's my analysis:\n\n1. **Age**: Low\n2. **Arrest History**: Medium\n3. **Weight**: High\n4. **Marital Status**: Low\n5. **Education**: High\n6. **Job History**: Medium\n7. **Drug Use**: High\n8. **Family Background**: Medium\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- The person is young and has multiple arrests but not convictions.\n- His weight is high, indicating a physical risk factor.\n- He is married, which might reduce crime risk.\n- Lack of education and no college enrollment are significant risk factors.\n- Multiple jobs suggest employment stability.\n- Drug use is a major risk factor.\n\nGiven these considerations, the outcome is likely to be \"YES\" due to multiple risk factors including age, weight, drug use, and lack of education. The confidence level is 80%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young age may indicate potential for change and rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests without conviction suggest some risk but also resilience.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"high\", \"Higher weight may be associated with increased physical health risks, though not directly related to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marriage could indicate a stable environment that might reduce crime risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and no college enrollment suggest potential for further development but also increased risk factors.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs may indicate employment stability, reducing the likelihood of crime.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for rearrest recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in an urban area could indicate a supportive environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
