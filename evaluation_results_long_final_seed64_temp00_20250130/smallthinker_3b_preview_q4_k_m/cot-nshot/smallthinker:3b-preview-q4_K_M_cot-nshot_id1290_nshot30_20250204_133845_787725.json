    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the case details:\n- The person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as Black.\n- She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted.\n- Her height is 5 feet 5 inches and weight is 158 lbs.\n- She has never been married and lives alone.\n- She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college.\n- She has held 3 jobs during the year.\n- She has not used any drugs in the past four years but has felt down at times.\n\nNow, let's consider each risk factor one by one:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system.\n2. **Age and Gender**: Being 22 years old and female might influence her behavior and decision-making processes.\n3. **Education Level**: Having a high school diploma suggests she may have limited educational attainment, which could impact her employability and life choices.\n4. **Employment Status**: Holding 3 jobs during the year indicates she is actively engaged in the workforce but may not be fully settled.\n5. **Drug Use History**: No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor, but feeling down at times suggests potential mental health issues.\n\nLet me check the n-shot examples to see how these factors are weighted in similar cases:\n\n- Arrest history: Low (1 shot), Medium (2 shots)\n- Age and gender: Low\n- Education level: Medium (3 shots)\n- Employment status: Medium (4 shots)\n- Drug use history: High (5 shots)\n\nBased on this analysis, I will assign the following weights to each risk factor:\n\n- Arrest History: Medium\n- Age and Gender: Low\n- Education Level: Medium\n- Employment Status: Medium\n- Drug Use History: High\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Given that she has been arrested once but not convicted, her education level is limited, she is actively employed, and she has no recent drug use but has felt down at times, I will predict a medium risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating some involvement with the legal system.\"),\n    (\"Age and Gender\", \"low\", \"Being 22 years old and female may influence her behavior and decision-making processes.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma suggests limited educational attainment, which could impact employability and life choices.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding 3 jobs during the year indicates active engagement in the workforce but potential instability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor, but feeling down at times suggests potential mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
