    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the given case and assign relative weights to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down the case details:\n- The person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black.\n- He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted.\n- His height and weight are given, but these might not be directly relevant to recidivism.\n- He is enrolled in school at present moment.\n- He has held 2 jobs during the year.\n- He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana).\n- At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.\n- He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nNow, let's assign weights to each factor based on the provided examples. I'll start with the most critical factors and work my way down.\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested 2 times but not convicted. This is a significant factor.\n   - Weight: High\n\n2. **Age at Arrest**: The person is 18 years old, which might indicate impulsivity or lack of maturity.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n3. **Education Level**: He is enrolled in school, which could suggest lower risk due to education.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n4. **Employment Status**: He has held 2 jobs during the year, indicating some level of employment stability.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n5. **Drug Use History**: He has used marijuana in the past four years, which is a moderate risk factor.\n   - Weight: Medium\n\n6. **Living Situation**: He lived with his biological mother in an urban area, which might indicate family support or other factors.\n   - Weight: Low\n\n7. **Spiritual Belief**: His belief in God might influence his behavior and decision-making.\n   - Weight: Low\n\nNow that I have assigned weights to each factor, let's use them collectively to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\n- High weight on arrest history suggests a high risk of recidivism.\n- Medium weight on age at arrest also indicates a higher risk due to potential impulsivity.\n- Low weight on education level and employment status suggest lower risks.\n- Medium weight on drug use history is significant but not as critical as the arrest history.\n- Low weights for living situation and spiritual belief further reduce the overall risk.\n\nConsidering these factors, I predict a moderate risk of recidivism. However, given the specific details of this case, I will assign a higher confidence level based on the unique circumstances.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested 2 times but not convicted, indicating a significant risk.\"),\n    (\"Age at Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Being 18 years old may suggest impulsivity or lack of maturity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school suggests lower risk due to education.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Has held 2 jobs during the year, indicating some level of employment stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years, which is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in an urban area, suggesting family support or other factors.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Belief\", \"low\", \"Believes in God, which might influence behavior and decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
