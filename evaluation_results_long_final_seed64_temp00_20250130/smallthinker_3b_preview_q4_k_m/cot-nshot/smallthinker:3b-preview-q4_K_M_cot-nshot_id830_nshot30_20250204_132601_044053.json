    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case of a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested twice and convicted both times, weighs 260 lbs, has never been married, is currently living alone, holds a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college, has held only one job during the year, uses marijuana as a substance of abuse, and lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, all in an urban area. He also considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me think about this step-by-step:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The individual has been arrested twice and convicted both times. This is a significant factor indicating a high likelihood of recidivism.\n2. **Age at First Arrest**: Although not explicitly stated, the age range (20-29) typically indicates a higher risk of recidivism due to the stage of life and potential for further criminal activity.\n3. **Substance Abuse**: Using marijuana as a substance of abuse is a moderate risk factor, indicating a need for intervention but not necessarily a high likelihood of recidivism.\n4. **Living Situation**: Currently living alone may indicate a lack of support system, which could be a low to medium risk factor depending on the individual's circumstances.\n5. **Education Level**: Holding only a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college is a moderate risk factor, as it suggests limited future prospects and potential for further criminal activity.\n6. **Employment Status**: Having held only one job during the year is a low to medium risk factor, indicating a lack of work experience but not necessarily a high likelihood of recidivism.\n\nLet me break this down further:\n\n- **Arrest History**: High risk due to multiple convictions.\n- **Age at First Arrest**: Medium risk due to the stage of life and potential for further criminal activity.\n- **Substance Abuse**: Moderate risk due to using marijuana as a substance of abuse.\n- **Living Situation**: Low to medium risk, depending on the individual's circumstances.\n- **Education Level**: Moderate risk due to limited future prospects.\n- **Employment Status**: Low to medium risk due to lack of work experience.\n\nNow, let me combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Given the high arrest history and moderate substance abuse, I would assign a high weight to these factors. The age at first arrest and education level are also significant but slightly lower in impact. The living situation and employment status are moderate risk factors.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I predict that this individual has a high likelihood of recidivism within the next three years. Therefore, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 85%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate a high risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age at First Arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual's age range (20-29) typically indicates a higher risk of recidivism due to the stage of life and potential for further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse\", \"moderate\", \"Using marijuana as a substance of abuse is a moderate risk factor, indicating a need for intervention but not necessarily a high likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low_to_medium\", \"Currently living alone may indicate a lack of support system, which could be a low to medium risk factor depending on the individual's circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"moderate\", \"Holding only a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college is a moderate risk factor, as it suggests limited future prospects and potential for further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low_to_medium\", \"Having held only one job during the year is a low to medium risk factor, indicating a lack of work experience but not necessarily a high likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
