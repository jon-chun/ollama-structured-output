    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested once but not convicted, is 5 feet 5 inches tall, weighs between 125 and 149 lbs, has never been married, lives with adults other than biological parents in an urban area, has a high school diploma, has held only one job during the year, uses drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, and does not consider God to be involved in her life. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's break down each risk factor and assign a relative weight based on its impact on 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: The person has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates past involvement with the legal system.\n2. **Age**: Being 20 years old means she is still in her early twenties, which could mean she has more time to mature and potentially change her behavior.\n3. **Height and Weight**: These factors are less directly related to criminal behavior but might influence how she perceives herself or interacts with others.\n4. **Marital Status**: Never married could indicate a certain level of independence, which might affect her life choices.\n5. **Living Situation**: Living with adults other than biological parents in an urban area suggests a different social environment compared to traditional family settings.\n6. **Education Level**: Having a high school diploma is important because it indicates some level of education and potentially better access to resources.\n7. **Employment History**: Holding only one job during the year could suggest instability or lack of commitment, which might be linked to criminal behavior.\n8. **Drug Use**: Using drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years is a clear indicator of substance abuse issues, which are often associated with higher recidivism rates.\n9. **Belief in God**: Not considering God to be involved in her life could indicate a lack of moral guidance or support system.\n\nNow, let's assign weights based on these factors:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: High (0.4)\n2. **Age**: Medium (0.3)\n3. **Height and Weight**: Low (0.1)\n4. **Marital Status**: Low (0.1)\n5. **Living Situation**: Medium (0.2)\n6. **Education Level**: Low (0.1)\n7. **Employment History**: High (0.3)\n8. **Drug Use**: High (0.4)\n9. **Belief in God**: Medium (0.2)\n\nLet me check the overall impact of these factors on 3-year rearrest recidivism:\n\n- Arrest History: High\n- Age: Medium\n- Height and Weight: Low\n- Marital Status: Low\n- Living Situation: Medium\n- Education Level: Low\n- Employment History: High\n- Drug Use: High\n- Belief in God: Medium\n\nNow, let's combine these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\n- Arrest History (0.4) + Employment History (0.3) + Drug Use (0.4) = 1.1\n- Age (0.3) + Living Situation (0.2) + Belief in God (0.2) = 0.7\n\nThe combined score is 1.1, which indicates a high risk of rearrest recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"high\", \"High arrest history increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may indicate potential for change and development.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"These factors are less directly related to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Never married could indicate independence or other factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with adults in an urban area suggests a different social environment.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma indicates some education and access to resources.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Only one job during the year may indicate instability or lack of commitment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Not considering God involved could indicate a lack of moral guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
