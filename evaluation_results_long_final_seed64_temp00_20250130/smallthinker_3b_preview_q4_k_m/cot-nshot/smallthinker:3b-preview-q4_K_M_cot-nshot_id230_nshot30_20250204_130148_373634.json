    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze the risk factors provided for the case of a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested twice and convicted once, weighs 168 lbs, is enrolled in a 4-year college, and has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. Being convicted of two offenses suggests a higher risk of recidivism. This factor should be weighted as high because it directly impacts the likelihood of future crimes.\n\nNext, his age is 22 years old. At this stage, individuals are still developing and may not have fully formed life plans or stable environments. This could influence their decision-making and increase the risk of criminal behavior. I'll assign a medium weight to this factor as it's significant but not as critical as the conviction history.\n\nHis education level is high school diploma with enrollment in a 4-year college. While having higher education can mitigate recidivism, it doesn't necessarily mean he won't reoffend. This factor should be weighted as low because while education is important, it may not directly correlate to future criminal behavior.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine usage over the past four years. This suggests a pattern of substance abuse that could influence his decision-making and increase the risk of recidivism. I'll assign a high weight to this factor as it's closely related to criminal activity.\n\nFinally, his belief in God is mentioned but not directly linked to criminal behavior. This factor should be weighted as low because while faith can play a role in rehabilitation, it doesn't necessarily correlate with future criminal behavior.\n\nLet me check the instruction again to ensure I've covered all aspects. Yes, I need to provide a JSON object with the risk factors and their weights, along with a prediction and confidence level.\n\nNow, let's put this together:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convicted\", \"high\", \"The conviction history suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may influence decision-making but does not directly correlate to future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Higher education can mitigate recidivism, but it does not necessarily mean he won't reoffend.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use history suggests a pattern of substance abuse that could influence his decision-making and increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"faith\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may play a role in rehabilitation, but it does not directly correlate to future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n\nThis prediction is based on the analysis of the provided risk factors and their weights. The confidence level is set at 80% as it reflects the overall assessment of the case.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convicted\", \"high\", \"The conviction history suggests a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age may influence decision-making but does not directly correlate to future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Higher education can mitigate recidivism, but it does not necessarily mean he won't reoffend.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use history suggests a pattern of substance abuse that could influence his decision-making and increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"faith\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may play a role in rehabilitation, but it does not directly correlate to future criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
