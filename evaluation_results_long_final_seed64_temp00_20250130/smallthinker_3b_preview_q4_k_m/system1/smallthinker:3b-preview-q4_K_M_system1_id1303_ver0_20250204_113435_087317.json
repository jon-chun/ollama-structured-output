    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant red flag. Conviction rates are higher among individuals with multiple arrests, which suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. I'll assign this factor a high weight in my assessment.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 18 years old, he's still a minor, but the fact that he's been arrested twice and convicted is alarming. This combination of factors points towards potential impulsivity or lack of mature decision-making skills. I'll give this factor a moderate to high weight in my assessment.\n\nHis physical attributes are relatively standard for his age and gender. There's no indication of any physical traits that would suggest a higher risk profile, so I won't assign this factor much weight.\n\nEducation level is another important factor. He has never been married, lives alone, and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate. This suggests a lack of social support and possibly a history of instability in his personal life. I'll assign this factor a moderate to high weight in my assessment.\n\nHis employment history shows that he's held 3 jobs during the year. While this is not necessarily indicative of risk, it does suggest some level of adaptability and resilience. However, given his other factors, I won't assign this factor much weight.\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana). This could be a sign of substance abuse issues or a history of problem-solving through drug use. Given that he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, it's less likely to be a major risk factor here. I'll assign this factor a moderate weight in my assessment.\n\nHis living situation is also noteworthy. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. This could indicate exposure to certain risks or influences that might affect his behavior. However, given the lack of specific details about these experiences, I won't assign this factor much weight.\n\nFinally, his belief in God and its relevance to personal life is interesting but doesn't directly suggest a high-risk profile. It's more of an abstract concept that may influence decision-making but isn't a concrete risk factor. I'll assign this factor a low weight in my assessment.\n\nLet me summarize the weights for each factor:\n- Criminal history: High\n- Age and gender: Moderate to High\n- Physical attributes: Low\n- Education level: Moderate to High\n- Employment history: Moderate\n- Drug use: Moderate\n- Living situation: Low\n- Belief in God: Low\n\nNow, let's calculate the overall confidence. Given the high weights for criminal history, age and gender, education level, and drug use, I'll assign a moderate to high confidence level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
