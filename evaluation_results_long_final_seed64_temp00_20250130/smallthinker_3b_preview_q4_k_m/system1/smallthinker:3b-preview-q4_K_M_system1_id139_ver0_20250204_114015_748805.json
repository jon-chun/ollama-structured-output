    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Black, with no prior convictions but has used drugs in the past four years. She's also had some personal struggles, such as feeling down and not being able to cheer herself up. Additionally, she's lived in various households throughout her life.\n\nWait, let me break this down further - what are the key risk factors here? We have substance use history, a history of mental health issues (as indicated by feelings of depression), and a complex family background with multiple residences. These could all potentially contribute to an increased risk of criminal behavior.\n\nLet me check the specifics: she's used drugs in the past four years, which is a significant factor. And while she hasn't been convicted yet, her history of substance use does raise concerns about potential future involvement in illegal activities.\n\nNow, considering her personal struggles - feeling down and unable to cheer herself up could be indicative of underlying mental health issues or emotional distress. This might suggest that she's more likely to engage in impulsive behavior or act out due to these feelings.\n\nLet me think about the family background as well. Living with a household of size 3, including her biological mother, suggests a potentially unstable environment. And the fact that she considers God to have something to do with what happens to her personally - this could indicate a strong sense of spirituality or faith, which might influence her decision-making in certain ways.\n\nWait a minute, I need to weigh all these factors against each other and consider how they might interact. The combination of substance use history, personal struggles, and complex family background does suggest a higher risk profile.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe that the presence of multiple risk factors - including substance use, mental health issues, and a potentially unstable environment - indicates a high risk for criminal behavior.\n\nSo, my prediction would be \"YES\", indicating a high risk. And based on the severity and combination of these factors, I'd estimate my confidence level to be around 85%.\n\nHere's my final answer in the required format:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
