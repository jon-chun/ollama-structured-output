    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic, arrested once but not convicted, with specific physical characteristics, living situation, education level, employment history, substance use, and past experiences. \n\nLet me break down each factor to understand its potential impact on risk assessment. The fact that she's a 19-year-old female could be relevant, especially considering the age and gender dynamics in criminal justice. However, I need more context about how these factors individually or collectively contribute to risk.\n\nWait, let me check the specifics of her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is an important distinction because conviction status can significantly influence risk assessment. But since she hasn't been convicted, it might suggest a lower likelihood of future criminal behavior, which could be a mitigating factor.\n\nNow, considering her physical characteristics and living situation - being 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 174 lbs, currently living alone, without a high school diploma or GED certificate, not enrolled in college, holding only one job during the year. These details seem to paint a picture of someone who is relatively independent but may face challenges in terms of education and employment.\n\nLet me think about her substance use history. She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and some periods have felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This suggests she might be dealing with mental health issues or a history of substance abuse, which are critical factors in risk assessment.\n\nAnother significant factor is her past living situation - having lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area. This could indicate instability and possibly exposure to negative influences during formative years.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally seems like a personal philosophy but might also reflect a lack of social support or moral guidance from traditional sources.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I need to weigh the potential risks against any mitigating circumstances. The combination of substance use history, past living situation, and belief in a non-interventionist God could suggest vulnerabilities that increase risk.\n\nWait a minute... Given the complexity and the need for a nuanced assessment, it seems prudent to err on the side of caution when predicting high risk. This is because the interplay between these factors can lead to unpredictable outcomes, especially considering her age and the potential for growth or change.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that while individual factors may indicate some level of risk, the overall picture suggests a need for a more detailed assessment before making a definitive prediction.\n\nTherefore, my response is:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
