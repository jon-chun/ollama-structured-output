    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. They have been arrested 3 times and convicted, which is a significant factor in indicating potential recidivism. Wait, let me check the specifics... Yes, being convicted multiple times suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues.\n\nNext, I'll consider their age and demographics. The person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Let me think about this for a moment... At such a young age, it's essential to recognize the potential impact of early criminal involvement on future life trajectories. This could be a critical factor in determining risk.\n\nNow, let's move on to their physical characteristics and living situation. They are 6 feet 1 inch tall and weigh 215 lbs, which is within a normal range. However, being currently living alone might indicate some level of independence or potential isolation. Hmm... This could be relevant, but I need to consider it in the context of other factors.\n\nTheir educational background is also important. They have a high school diploma and are not enrolled in college. Let me reflect on this for a moment... Limited education can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors or lower opportunities for positive development. This is something to keep in mind as I assess their overall risk profile.\n\nIn terms of employment, they have held 2 jobs during the year, which suggests some level of work experience and financial stability. However, let me think about this... The fact that they've used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana, and experienced feelings of depression or despair could indicate a higher risk for substance abuse and mental health issues.\n\nNow, considering their family background, they have lived in a household of size 7 at some point. Wait a minute... This could be relevant to understanding their social support network and potential environmental influences on behavior. It's essential to consider how these factors might interact with other aspects of their life.\n\nFinally, let me think about their personal beliefs and values. They consider that God has something to do with what happens to them personally. Hmm... While this is a significant factor in many people's lives, it may not directly impact risk assessment in the same way as other behavioral or environmental factors.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I need to determine if they collectively indicate high risk. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of their criminal history, limited education, substance use, and potential mental health issues does suggest a higher risk profile. However, it's crucial to remember that individual circumstances can vary significantly, and this assessment should be used as part of a comprehensive evaluation.\n\nGiven the complexity of these factors and the need for a nuanced understanding, I will conclude my analysis with a careful consideration of the overall risk level. After all these calculations and reflections, I believe the person in question does indeed indicate high risk.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
