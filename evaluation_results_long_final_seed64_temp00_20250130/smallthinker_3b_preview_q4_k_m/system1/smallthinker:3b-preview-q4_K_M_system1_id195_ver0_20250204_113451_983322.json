    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. They have been arrested 4 times and convicted, which is a significant factor in indicating potential recidivism. Wait, let me check the specifics of their conviction... Yes, it seems that they have a history of committing crimes, which could be a major risk factor.\n\nNext, I'll consider their age and gender. The person is a 22-year-old male, which might influence their likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. Let me think about this for a moment... While age and gender can provide some context, they are not the sole determinants of risk.\n\nNow, let's look at their personal life. They are married, living with their spouse, and have a high school diploma. These factors suggest that they may be stable in their relationships and have a basic level of education. However, I need to consider how these factors might interact with their criminal history... Hmm, it seems that their marriage and education could provide some support, but the conviction still raises concerns.\n\nThe person's physical characteristics, such as height and weight, don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment. Let me focus on other aspects... Ah yes, their job history: they have held only 1 job during the year. This lack of stability in employment might indicate difficulties in maintaining a steady income or career progression.\n\nNow, let's examine their substance use. They have used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While this is not necessarily indicative of high risk, it does suggest some level of substance abuse. Wait a minute... I need to consider how this might impact their behavior and decision-making processes.\n\nThe person also has a history of living with both biological parents in a household of size 4, which could provide some context for their upbringing and potential influences on their behavior. Let me think about this for a moment... Yes, it seems that their family background might have played a role in shaping their values and actions.\n\nFinally, I'll consider their spiritual beliefs. The person considers that God has something to do with what happens to them personally. This could be an important factor in understanding their motivations and decision-making processes. Let me reflect on this for a moment... While spirituality can provide some guidance and support, it's not directly relevant to risk assessment.\n\nAfter carefully analyzing all these factors, I need to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me summarize my thoughts... The person has a significant criminal history, uses drugs, and has held only one job during the year. These factors suggest that they may be at higher risk of engaging in further criminal activity or experiencing difficulties in their personal life.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would predict that the person is at high risk. Let me calculate my confidence level... Based on the evidence, I'm fairly confident in this prediction. My confidence level is 85%.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
