    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested 3 times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past behavior and potential recidivism. I need to think about how this impacts the overall risk assessment. Given that he has a conviction record, it suggests a pattern of engaging in illegal activities.\n\nNext, let's look at his age and gender. The individual is 22 years old and male. These factors alone do not necessarily indicate high risk, but they are part of the broader picture. I need to consider how these demographic factors might influence the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's examine his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs. These details don't directly relate to risk assessment unless there are specific medical conditions or disabilities that could impact his ability to commit crimes. In this case, no such information is provided, so I'll move on.\n\nHis marital status and living situation are also important. He has never been married and currently lives alone. This suggests a certain level of independence and possibly a higher risk tolerance. However, without more context, it's hard to draw definitive conclusions.\n\nEducation and employment history are crucial in assessing potential recidivism. The person holds a high school diploma and has held only one job during the year. These factors suggest limited education and employment stability, which could be indicators of future criminal behavior.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. This indicates a lack of substance abuse issues and mental health concerns, which are significant positive factors in risk assessment.\n\nLastly, his background includes living with his biological mother in a household of size 2 at a young age. While this is an important part of his history, it does not directly correlate to current risk levels without further context.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of moral compass or ethical considerations. This could be a significant factor in assessing his potential for future criminal behavior.\n\nLet me check the overall picture now. The combination of past arrests and convictions, limited education and employment history, and the absence of substance abuse issues and mental health concerns are all indicators of high risk. However, the belief that God has nothing to do with personal matters adds a layer of complexity, suggesting potential for future criminal behavior.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that these factors collectively indicate a high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
