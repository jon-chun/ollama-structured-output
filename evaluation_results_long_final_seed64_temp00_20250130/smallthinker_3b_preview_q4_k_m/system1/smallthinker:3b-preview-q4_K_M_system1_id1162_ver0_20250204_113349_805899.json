    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the demographic information:\n- Age: 20 years old - This is relatively young, but age alone doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk.\n- Hispanic ethnicity - Ethnicity can be a factor in certain contexts, but it's not directly indicative of criminal behavior without additional context.\n- Arrest record: 1 time, not convicted - A single arrest without conviction might suggest some level of involvement with the legal system, but it's not conclusive.\n\nNext, let's consider her personal life:\n- Never married, currently not living alone - This suggests a certain level of independence and possibly a history of moving frequently.\n- High school diploma, not enrolled in college - Education level can be a factor, as higher education often correlates with lower crime rates, but it's not definitive.\n\nNow, let's examine her employment and lifestyle:\n- Held 1 job during the year - This indicates limited work experience, which might suggest instability or lack of commitment.\n- Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) - Drug use is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, especially if it involves substance abuse.\n- Has not felt depressed over the past month - The absence of depression could be seen as a positive factor, but it's important to consider other mental health indicators.\n\nFinally, let's look at her background:\n- Lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, urban area - This suggests a history of living in non-traditional family settings, which could be relevant.\n- Believes God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally - This statement might indicate a lack of moral compass or a disregard for societal norms.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. While the individual has some risk factors such as drug use and a history of living in non-traditional family settings, she also has several mitigating factors like education and employment stability. The absence of depression and her belief that God is not relevant to personal life suggest a certain level of resilience and possibly a lower likelihood of engaging in high-risk behavior.\n\nWait, let me break this down further - the key here is to balance the risk factors with the mitigating ones. Given the information provided, it seems that while there are some red flags, they do not strongly indicate a high-risk profile for criminal activity.\n\nFantastic! After all these considerations, I can confidently say that the individual does not appear to be at a high risk of engaging in criminal behavior based on the given factors.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
