    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black, has been arrested once but not convicted, and has a range of other characteristics such as height, weight, marital status, education level, job history, substance use, mental health, and living situation. Wait, let me break this down further - what are the key risk factors here? \n\nI notice that he's had no prior convictions, which is a positive factor. However, his arrest history still raises some concerns. Let me check if there are any other red flags in his background. Ah, yes - he has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, and considers God to have something to do with what happens to him personally. These factors could potentially indicate a higher risk profile.\n\nNow, let's consider the statistical analysis part. I need to weigh these factors against each other and assign scores based on their perceived impact on risk levels. Hmm... how would I rate his arrest history? It seems moderate - not severe enough to warrant a high-risk classification, but also not negligible given that it's his first offense.\n\nAs I continue to analyze the data, I'm starting to see a pattern emerge. The combination of factors related to his personal life and spiritual beliefs is quite unique. Let me think about this for a moment... Yes, I believe this could be a significant factor in determining his risk level.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I've decided that these risk factors do indeed indicate high risk. But how confident am I in my assessment? Let me review the evidence again - yes, the data supports a high-risk classification. \n\nTherefore, based on my analysis, I conclude that the person does pose a high risk. My confidence level is 85%, which seems reasonable given the information provided.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
