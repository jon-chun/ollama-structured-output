    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as American Indian / Eskimo / Aleut. She has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. Her physical characteristics include being 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing 140 lbs. She is married, currently living with her spouse, does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, and has held only one job during the year. Additionally, she has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has experienced feelings of depression in the past month.\n\nWait, let me break down these risk factors further. The fact that she's been arrested twice but not convicted is a significant concern. It suggests that there might be underlying issues with her behavior or interactions with law enforcement. Let me check if this factor alone warrants a high-risk prediction.\n\nNext, I'll consider her educational background and employment history. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and has only held one job during the year. This indicates potential difficulties in education and employment, which could be linked to various risk factors such as lack of social support, financial instability, or personal struggles.\n\nNow, let's examine her substance use history. She has used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. While this is a concerning factor, I need to consider how it might impact her behavior and decision-making. It seems that her drug use could be related to mental health issues, such as depression, which she also experiences.\n\nLet me think about her living situation and family background. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 when she was younger. This experience might have had an impact on her life, potentially influencing her current behavior or perceptions. Additionally, her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally could be seen as a coping mechanism or a factor in her decision-making process.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I'm starting to see a pattern of potential risk indicators. The combination of her arrest history, lack of education and employment stability, substance use, and personal beliefs might suggest that she is at higher risk for certain behaviors or outcomes.\n\nWait a minute... Given the complexity of these risk factors and how they intersect with each other, I believe it's reasonable to conclude that this person does indeed indicate high risk. The cumulative effect of her experiences and current circumstances suggests a potential for more severe consequences if not addressed properly.\n\nTherefore, after careful analysis, my prediction is that yes, these risk factors do indicate high risk. My confidence in this prediction is based on the comprehensive evaluation of all provided information and its implications.\n\nHere's my final answer in the required format:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
