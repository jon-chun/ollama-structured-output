    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White, has been arrested 5 times and convicted, and has various other characteristics such as height, weight, marital status, education level, job history, substance use, and personal beliefs. \n\nLet me break down each of these factors to understand their potential impact on the risk assessment. The fact that he's been arrested multiple times and convicted is a significant red flag - it suggests a pattern of behavior that may be associated with higher risk tendencies.\n\nWait, let me consider this further... Being arrested 5 times and convicted implies a history of engaging in criminal activities, which could indicate a propensity for continued criminal behavior. This is a crucial point to note.\n\nNow, let's examine the other factors: his physical characteristics, such as height and weight range, don't seem particularly relevant to risk assessment on their own. However, his lack of education and job history might be important - being out of school and without employment could indicate limited opportunities for positive change or rehabilitation.\n\nLet me think about this some more... The fact that he's never been married and is currently not living alone suggests a certain level of independence, but it also means there may be no immediate support system in place to help him make better choices. Additionally, his history of substance use, particularly marijuana and cocaine, over the past four years, including recent periods of feeling down, could indicate a risk factor related to mental health or addiction.\n\nHold on, I should also consider his living situation - being part of a household with 4 people at a young age might suggest some level of social influence that could impact his behavior. And then there's the personal belief about God having something to do with what happens to him personally - this could potentially indicate a sense of meaning or purpose, but it's also somewhat vague and doesn't directly correlate with risk factors in a straightforward way.\n\nNow, let me synthesize all these factors... Given the combination of his arrest history, substance use, lack of education and job opportunities, and personal beliefs, I'm starting to see a pattern that suggests he may be at high risk. The confidence level for this assessment is subjective but based on the severity and frequency of the risk factors provided.\n\nAfter careful consideration, my conclusion is that these risk factors do indeed indicate high risk. Therefore, my answer should reflect this assessment in the required format.\n\nHere's my refined response:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
