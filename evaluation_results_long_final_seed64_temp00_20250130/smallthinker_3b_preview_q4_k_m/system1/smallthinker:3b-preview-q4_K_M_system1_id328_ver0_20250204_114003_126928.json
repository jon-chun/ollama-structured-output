    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 22 years old - This is relatively young, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk unless combined with other factors.\n- Race/ethnicity: White - No direct correlation to risk here.\n- Arrest history: 1 arrest, not convicted - This could be a red flag, but without conviction, the impact might be less severe.\n\nNext, let's look at her personal life:\n- Living situation: Currently living alone - This is neutral; it doesn't suggest any high-risk behavior.\n- Marital status: Never married - Again, no direct correlation to risk.\n- Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college - This might indicate a lack of higher education or career advancement opportunities, but it's not inherently risky.\n\nNow, let's examine her employment history:\n- 3 jobs during the year - This is average; it doesn't suggest any high-risk behavior related to work.\n- Drug use: No drugs used in the past four years - This is positive and suggests a clean record.\n\nMoving on to mental health:\n- Past month feelings of depression: So down that nothing could cheer her up - This indicates significant emotional distress, which could be a risk factor. However, it's important to consider the context and whether this is an isolated incident or part of a larger pattern.\n- Previous living situation: Household size 4 in an urban area - This might suggest exposure to certain risks, but without more information on what those risks are, it's hard to gauge its impact.\n\nFinally, let's look at her spiritual beliefs:\n- Belief in God and its role in personal life - This is neutral; it doesn't indicate any high-risk behavior.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. While the individual has a history of emotional distress and a past incident that could be concerning, the overall pattern suggests a relatively stable and low-risk profile. The arrest without conviction and the feelings of depression are significant factors, but they don't necessarily indicate a high risk unless combined with other indicators.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. The combination of emotional distress and a past incident does raise some red flags, but given her overall stability and lack of other risky behaviors, I would lean towards a moderate level of risk rather than high.\n\nFantastic! After all these calculations, I can confidently say that the individual's profile suggests a moderate to low-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
