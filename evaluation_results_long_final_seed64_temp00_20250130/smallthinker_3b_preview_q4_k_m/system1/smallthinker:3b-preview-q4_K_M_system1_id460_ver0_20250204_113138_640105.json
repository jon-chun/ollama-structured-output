    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested once but has not been convicted. His physical attributes include being 6 feet 0 inches tall and weighing 204 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone, which might suggest some level of independence or instability in his personal life.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break down the key risk factors here. The fact that he's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted could be significant, as it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, without knowing the specifics of the arrest and conviction status, it's hard to gauge the severity of this factor.\n\nLet me check the other details... He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, which might suggest he hasn't completed higher education. This could be a risk factor, as completing higher education can often indicate a greater commitment to personal development or a desire for stability.\n\nNow, considering his employment history - he's held 4 jobs during the year. This suggests some level of job-hopping, which could indicate instability in his career and possibly in other areas of life. Let me think about this... Job-hopping can be a sign of various things, including a lack of long-term commitment or perhaps a need to explore different opportunities.\n\nMoving on, he has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) but hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is an important factor because substance use can sometimes be linked with mental health issues, although it's not always the case. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently might suggest some level of emotional well-being.\n\nLet me consider his living situation... He has never been married and is currently not living alone, which could indicate a lack of stable relationships or personal life structure. This might be a risk factor, as having a stable support system can often help mitigate other risks.\n\nNow, regarding his background - he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6 when he was younger. This information is crucial because it provides insight into his family environment and possibly how it has shaped him. It's also mentioned that he considers God to have nothing to do with what happens to him personally, which could indicate a certain level of independence or perhaps a lack of faith in traditional societal structures.\n\nWait, let me think about this... Given all these factors, I need to assess the overall risk profile. The combination of his arrest history, job-hopping, substance use, and living situation does suggest some instability and potential for involvement with the legal system. However, the fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently and has a GED might mitigate some of these risks.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe the risk factors do indicate high risk. The combination of his arrest history, job-hopping, substance use, and living situation suggests a pattern of instability and potential for involvement with the legal system. While he hasn't felt depressed recently and has a GED, these factors alone may not be enough to mitigate the overall risk profile.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is that yes, these risk factors indicate high risk. My confidence in this assessment is 85%.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
