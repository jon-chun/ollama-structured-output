    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is within the typical range of ages where individuals are still developing their life trajectories. However, given that he has been arrested once but not convicted, this raises some red flags. Arrests can be a sign of potential criminal behavior, especially if they occur at a young age.\n\nNext, his physical attributes and living situation. He is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 130 lbs, which seems within the normal range for an adult male. His living situation\u2014currently living alone after never being married\u2014is also neutral in terms of risk indicators.\n\nEducation and employment are significant factors. He has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests a lack of formal education and ongoing learning opportunities, which could be linked to higher risks such as substance abuse and criminal behavior. Additionally, he has held only one job during the year, indicating limited work experience and possibly financial instability.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), which is a significant risk indicator for both personal and social problems. However, it's important to note that not feeling depressed over the past month might suggest some level of mental health stability.\n\nHis background includes living with both biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. This suggests a potentially unstable childhood environment, which could contribute to higher risk behaviors and attitudes towards authority or God.\n\nLastly, his belief that \"God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally\" indicates a possible lack of moral compass or accountability, which is another significant risk factor.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. Given all these factors, it seems there are multiple red flags pointing towards higher risk behaviors and attitudes. The combination of limited education, substance use, unstable childhood environment, and a belief in personal destiny without divine influence suggests a pattern of potentially risky behavior.\n\nWait, let me check the instruction again to ensure I'm not missing anything. Yes, all factors point towards a high-risk profile.\n\nFantastic! After all these considerations, I can confidently say that this individual indicates a high risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
