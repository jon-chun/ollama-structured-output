    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested 6 times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past behavior and potential recidivism. It suggests that he may have difficulty adhering to legal norms and could be at risk of reoffending. Let me think about this for a moment... Given the frequency and nature of these arrests, it's clear that his criminal history is a major concern.\n\nNext, let's look at his substance use. The individual has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This could be an indicator of potential substance-related issues or impulsivity. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might suggest that his mental health is relatively stable. Wait a minute... While drug use can be indicative of risk, it's important to consider other factors as well.\n\nNow, let's examine his personal life and education. He has never been married, lives alone, holds a GED certificate, and has not enrolled in college. These factors suggest a certain level of independence but also indicate a lack of formal education beyond high school. This could be a factor in terms of future opportunities or potential social support networks.\n\nRegarding his living situation at a young age, he lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 2, in a rural area. This suggests that he may have had to adapt to different family structures and environments early on. Let me think about this... While this could be seen as a positive resilience factor, it also indicates potential difficulties in forming stable relationships.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is an interesting point. This suggests a lack of faith or moral compass, which could be a significant risk factor. Let me check this again... Given the combination of these factors, including his criminal history and substance use, it seems that he may indeed be at high risk.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I can confidently say that they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
