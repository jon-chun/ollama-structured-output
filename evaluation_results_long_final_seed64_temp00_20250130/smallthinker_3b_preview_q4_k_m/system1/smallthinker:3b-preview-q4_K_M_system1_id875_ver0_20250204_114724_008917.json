    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 18 years old, he is still a young adult, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence his behavior and decision-making. However, this alone does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nNext, his arrest record. He has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This suggests some level of involvement with the legal system, but it's important to note that he is still a minor at the time of the arrest. Conviction would be more indicative of a pattern of behavior leading to criminal activity.\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward and do not seem to pose any significant risk factors on their own.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone after having lived with both biological parents in a household of size 6. This suggests some level of independence, which is generally positive but could also indicate a lack of support system.\n\nEducation and employment: He has a GED certificate and has held two jobs during the year. This indicates some level of education and work experience, which are generally positive indicators.\n\nDrug use history: He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana). While this is concerning, it's important to consider that marijuana use alone does not necessarily indicate a high-risk profile for criminal behavior.\n\nMental health status: He has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests he is currently in a relatively stable mental state, which is positive.\n\nFamily background: He has lived with both biological parents in a household of size 6, in an urban area. This could suggest some level of family instability or exposure to different environments, but it does not necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nBelief in God's influence: His belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is intriguing and suggests a strong sense of spirituality. While this can be both positive and negative depending on the context, it does not directly indicate high risk behavior.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. Given all these factors, I need to weigh them against each other to determine if they collectively suggest a high-risk profile. The arrest record is concerning, but the lack of conviction and current mental health status are mitigating factors. His education and employment history are positive indicators, while his drug use history is a concern but not necessarily indicative of criminal behavior.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. The key here is to consider the overall pattern of risk factors. While he has used drugs in the past four years, he has also held two jobs and has a GED certificate. His belief in God's influence suggests a strong moral compass, which could act as a protective factor.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I realize that while there are some concerning factors, they do not collectively indicate a high-risk profile for criminal behavior. The arrest record is the most significant concern, but it is mitigated by his current mental health status and positive educational and employment history.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
