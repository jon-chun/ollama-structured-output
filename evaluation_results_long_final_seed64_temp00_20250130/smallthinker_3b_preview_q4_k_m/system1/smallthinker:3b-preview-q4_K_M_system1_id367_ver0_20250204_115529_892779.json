    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background and personal history. She is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White, which doesn't immediately raise any red flags. However, her arrest record - being arrested 4 times and having been convicted - does seem concerning. Wait, let me check if this is a significant factor in itself or if it's just one piece of the puzzle.\n\nAs I delve deeper, I notice that she has never been married and is currently living alone. This could potentially indicate some level of independence, but it also might suggest a lack of social support network. Let me think about how this factors into her overall risk profile... \n\nShe is enrolled in school at the present moment, which is generally a positive sign, as education can be a mitigating factor against criminal behavior. However, her employment history - holding 3 jobs during the year - could also be seen as a mix of stability and instability. It's essential to consider both aspects when evaluating her risk level.\n\nNow, let's look at her substance use. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which is a significant factor. But more concerning are her recent feelings of depression - feeling so down that nothing could cheer her up during some periods. This suggests she might be struggling with mental health issues, which could potentially influence her behavior.\n\nHer living situation and family background also play crucial roles in risk assessment. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 when she was younger, which could indicate exposure to certain influences or challenges that might have shaped her life path. And her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally - this is an interesting aspect, as it might reflect a lack of moral compass or accountability.\n\nLet me break down the confidence level in my assessment... Given all these factors, I'm inclined to think that they collectively indicate a high risk profile. But how confident am I about this prediction? After careful consideration, I'd say my confidence is around 85%. \n\nSo, after weighing all these factors and considering their potential impact on her behavior, I can confidently provide my assessment.\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
