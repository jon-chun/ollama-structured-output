    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. This is a significant factor, as it suggests she may have a pattern of engaging in illegal activities. Wait, let me check if there are any other factors that could be related to her criminal behavior... \n\nYes, I've found another relevant factor: she has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates a possible substance use disorder and emotional distress, which could be linked to her criminal behavior. Let me think about how these factors might be connected... \n\nIt seems that her history of arrests and convictions, combined with her drug use and emotional distress, suggests a high risk of reoffending. But I need to consider other factors as well. She is married, currently living with her spouse, and has a high school diploma. These factors suggest she may have social support and education, which could potentially mitigate her risk. However, let me weigh the importance of these factors against the others... \n\nShe has held only 1 job during the year, which might indicate instability or lack of employment skills. And at a young age, she lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 6, which could suggest a history of living in challenging environments. But how do these factors contribute to her risk level? \n\nAs I consider all these factors, I'm starting to see a pattern emerge. The combination of her criminal history, substance use, emotional distress, and potentially unstable environment suggests a high risk of reoffending. Let me think about the confidence level in my assessment... \n\nGiven the severity of her criminal history and the presence of other risk factors, I would say that my confidence level is quite high. But let me quantify it... I'll assign a confidence level of 85%. This means I'm fairly certain that these risk factors indicate a high risk of reoffending.\n\nNow, let me summarize my findings in a JSON object format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
