    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White, has been arrested once but not convicted, is 5 feet 6 inches tall, weighs 165 lbs, lives alone, has a high school diploma, and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. Additionally, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area, and considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nLet me break down these factors one by one. The fact that she's been arrested once but not convicted is a significant concern, as it suggests some level of involvement with the justice system. However, I need to consider the context - at 19 years old, this could be a relatively minor offense or an early learning experience.\n\nWait a minute... The use of drugs in the past four years is another critical factor. While not necessarily indicative of high risk on its own, it does suggest some level of substance abuse that needs to be monitored and addressed.\n\nNow, let's consider her living situation and education background. Living alone at 19 might indicate independence or a certain level of maturity, but it could also suggest vulnerability if she lacks strong support systems. Her educational attainment is notable, as being enrolled in a 2-year college suggests some level of commitment to personal development.\n\nLet me check the other factors... She has never been married and is currently living alone, which might indicate a certain level of autonomy or independence. The consideration that God has something to do with what happens to her personally could be seen as a positive factor, indicating a strong sense of spirituality or moral guidance.\n\nHowever, I need to weigh these factors against the potential for high risk behavior. Given her age and the fact that she's still in her early twenties, it's possible that she may not fully understand the consequences of her actions. The use of drugs is a significant concern, as it could lead to further legal issues or health problems.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm starting to lean towards a cautious approach. While some factors suggest a level of maturity and personal responsibility, others indicate potential vulnerabilities or areas for concern.\n\nLet me think about this some more... If we consider the combination of her age, substance use history, and the context provided (such as living with both biological parents in an urban area), it seems that there are indeed several risk factors at play here. The use of drugs, combined with the potential lack of strong support systems due to living alone, could lead to a higher likelihood of engaging in high-risk behavior.\n\nWait, I've got it... After weighing all these factors and considering the potential for high risk behavior, I believe that yes, these risk factors do indicate high risk. The combination of her age, substance use history, and the context provided suggests a need for careful monitoring and intervention to prevent further involvement with the justice system or other negative outcomes.\n\nTherefore, my analysis leads me to conclude that the answer is indeed YES, indicating high risk. My confidence in this conclusion is based on a thorough evaluation of all provided factors and their potential implications.\n\nHere's my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
