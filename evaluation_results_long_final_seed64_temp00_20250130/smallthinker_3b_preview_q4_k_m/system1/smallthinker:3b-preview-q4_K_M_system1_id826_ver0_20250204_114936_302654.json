    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested 8 times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past behavior and potential recidivism. I need to think about how this impacts the overall risk assessment. Given that he has a substantial number of convictions, it suggests a pattern of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nNext, let's look at his personal background. He was raised in a household with three people, which is relatively small. This could indicate limited social support and possibly an environment where substance use might be more prevalent. However, the fact that he has never been married and is currently not living alone suggests some level of independence.\n\nNow, let's consider his educational status. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lack of formal education and potential barriers to employment. Given that he has held only three jobs during the year, this further supports the idea of limited employability and possibly financial instability.\n\nMoving on to his substance use history. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), which is a significant factor. However, it's important to note that he has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that while there may be some substance use issues, mental health concerns are relatively low.\n\nLastly, let's consider his belief in God and its impact on personal experiences. He believes that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a strong sense of spirituality or possibly a coping mechanism for life events. However, this factor alone does not significantly impact the overall risk assessment.\n\nLet me think about all these factors together. The combination of multiple arrests and convictions, limited education, substance use history, and financial instability suggests a pattern of criminal behavior and potential difficulties in maintaining stable employment and living situations. Additionally, the belief in God might be seen as a coping mechanism but does not directly correlate with risk levels.\n\nWait a minute... Given all these factors, it seems that this individual has a high likelihood of engaging in further criminal activity due to his past convictions and limited resources. Therefore, I can confidently say that these risk factors indicate a high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
