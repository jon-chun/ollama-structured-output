    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information. The individual is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. This information alone doesn't seem to be a significant factor in determining her risk level. Wait, let me check if there are any other factors that might be relevant... \n\nYes, it seems that her age and gender don't directly impact the assessment of her risk level. Now, let's move on to her criminal history. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. This is a crucial piece of information - being convicted can indicate a pattern of behavior or a willingness to engage in illegal activities. Let me think about how this might affect her risk level... \n\nGiven that she has been convicted, it suggests that she may be more likely to continue engaging in criminal activity. However, I need to consider other factors as well. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs, which doesn't seem to be a significant factor in determining her risk level. Her living situation - currently living alone - also doesn't appear to be relevant.\n\nNow, let's examine her education and employment history. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, as well as having held 1 job during the year. These factors might indicate that she has limited educational attainment and work experience, which could potentially affect her risk level. Wait a minute... \n\nWhile these factors are important, they don't necessarily indicate a high risk of criminal behavior. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), but it's also mentioned that she hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This is an interesting combination - using drugs doesn't always lead to criminal activity, especially if there are underlying mental health issues at play.\n\nLet me think about this further... The fact that she has lived with her biological mother in a household of size 9, in a rural area, might suggest some level of family instability. However, I need to consider whether this is directly related to her risk level. And what about the statement that she considers God to have something to do with what happens to her personally? This seems like a personal belief and doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk of criminal behavior.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I'm starting to form an opinion about the person's risk level. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of being convicted, using drugs in the past four years, and having lived with her biological mother in a household of size 9 seems to suggest some level of instability or potential for criminal behavior. However, the fact that she hasn't felt depressed over the past month and considers God to have something to do with what happens to her personally might indicate a more nuanced situation.\n\nGiven all these factors, I'm going to take a closer look at the overall risk assessment. Let me check my calculations... \n\nAfter re-examining the risk factors and considering the individual's background information, I've come to a conclusion. The combination of factors suggests that this person may be at high risk. However, it's essential to note that risk assessments are complex and often require further evaluation.\n\nNow, let me finalize my answer in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
