    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for an individual. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. The fact that he has been arrested 10 times and convicted suggests a pattern of criminal behavior. This is a significant red flag. However, I need to balance this with other factors to get a comprehensive view.\n\nNext, his age and gender are straightforward. At 18 years old, he is still in the formative years of his life. Being male does not inherently indicate higher risk unless there are additional factors at play.\n\nHis physical attributes\u2014height and weight\u2014are typical for an individual of his age and gender. They do not contribute to a high-risk profile on their own.\n\nMarital status and living situation also don't seem to be indicators of high risk, as they are neutral or slightly positive in nature.\n\nEducation level is another factor. The fact that he has never been married and is currently not living alone might suggest some independence, but it doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nHis job history shows a single job during the year, which could indicate unemployment or limited work experience. This is somewhat concerning but not necessarily indicative of high risk without further context.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant factor. It suggests substance abuse issues, which can be linked to criminal behavior. However, it's important to note that drug use alone does not automatically mean he will engage in criminal activity.\n\nHis mental health status\u2014lack of depression over the past month\u2014is positive and doesn't indicate any high-risk behaviors.\n\nThe household size factor is neutral unless there are additional indicators suggesting abuse or neglect, which isn't present here.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally could be seen as a protective factor. It suggests he might have some moral compass or religious influence guiding his actions.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. While many of these factors individually suggest some level of risk, the combination seems to point towards a higher likelihood of criminal behavior. However, I need to quantify this into a confidence score.\n\nWait a minute... Let's break it down:\n- Arrest history: High risk\n- Drug use: Moderate to high risk\n- Lack of education and employment: Moderate risk\n- Other factors: Neutral or slightly positive\n\nConsidering these points, I would say that the overall profile indicates a moderate to high risk. But how do I translate this into a confidence score?\n\nLet me check my notes again. Given the combination of arrest history, drug use, and limited education and employment, I would estimate a confidence level around 75-80%.\n\nFantastic! After all these calculations, I can confidently say that the overall profile indicates a moderate to high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
