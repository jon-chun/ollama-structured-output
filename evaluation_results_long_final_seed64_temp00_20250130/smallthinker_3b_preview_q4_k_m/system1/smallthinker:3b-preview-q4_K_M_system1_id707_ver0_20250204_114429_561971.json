    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for an individual. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant red flag. Conviction rates are typically lower among younger individuals, so this suggests a pattern of illegal behavior that could indicate a higher risk of continued criminal activity.\n\nNext, I'll look at his substance use. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. While occasional drug use does not necessarily indicate high risk, repeated use over an extended period may suggest a dependency or tolerance for such substances. This factor alone is concerning but needs to be considered alongside other factors.\n\nNow, let's examine his mental health status. The individual has not felt depressed over the past month. This is a positive sign and suggests that he is currently in a relatively stable emotional state. However, it does not rule out the possibility of underlying psychological issues that could manifest at any time.\n\nMoving on to his living situation, he is currently living alone and has never been married. Living alone can sometimes lead to social isolation, which might affect one's behavior and decision-making processes. This factor needs to be considered in conjunction with other aspects of his life.\n\nHis educational status is also noteworthy. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. Education often serves as a buffer against criminal activity and substance abuse, so this is a positive indicator.\n\nLastly, his belief in God and its role in personal experiences is an interesting factor. While faith can be a protective factor against certain behaviors, it does not necessarily indicate high risk on its own. However, it's important to consider how such beliefs might influence his behavior or decision-making processes.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. Given the combination of his criminal history, substance use, and living situation, I believe these factors collectively suggest a higher risk profile. The pattern of repeated arrests and convictions, combined with his substance use and social isolation, raises concerns about his likelihood to engage in further illegal activities or continue using drugs.\n\nWait, let me check my reasoning again. Yes, the combination of these factors does indeed point towards a high-risk profile. Therefore, I can confidently say that these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
