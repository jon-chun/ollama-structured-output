    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White, has been arrested once but not convicted, is 5 feet 7 inches tall, weighs between 150 and 174 lbs, has never been married, lives alone, holds a high school diploma, has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana), has not felt depressed over the past month, and has lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in a rural area. She also considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nLet me break down these factors one by one. The fact that she's been arrested once but not convicted is a significant concern, as it suggests some level of involvement with the legal system. However, the lack of conviction might indicate that this was an isolated incident or perhaps a mistake on her part. Wait, let me consider how to weigh this against other factors... \n\nThe age and gender of the individual are typically not considered risk factors in themselves, so I'll set those aside for now. The physical attributes like height and weight don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment either. Living alone could potentially be a factor if it suggests a lack of social support, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nThe educational background is another point - having a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college might indicate some level of maturity or independence, but again, this doesn't necessarily correlate with risk. The employment history shows she has held four jobs during the year, which could suggest adaptability and resilience, but it also indicates a certain level of mobility and possibly a lack of long-term commitment.\n\nThe use of drugs in the past four years is concerning, as substance abuse can be linked to various risks including criminal activity or mental health issues. However, the fact that she hasn't felt depressed over the past month suggests that her current emotional state might not be directly related to these factors. Let me think about how this fits into a broader risk assessment framework...\n\nThe living situation with both biological parents in a rural area could potentially provide some support systems or family dynamics that mitigate risks, but it's also possible that such an environment could contribute to certain vulnerabilities. And the statement about God having nothing to do with what happens to her personally is quite interesting - it might indicate a strong sense of self-reliance or independence, which could be seen as a positive trait in some contexts.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together... I'm starting to see that while there are certainly concerns, none of them seem to point directly towards high risk. The combination of factors doesn't paint a picture of someone who is likely to engage in criminal activity or pose significant harm to others. Wait a minute, let me summarize my thoughts...\n\nGiven the information provided and considering each factor carefully, I believe that while there are some concerns, they do not collectively indicate high risk. Therefore, my prediction would be \"NO\", with a moderate level of confidence.\n\nHere is my refined answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
