    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White, has been arrested twice, and has a conviction record. He's also 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighs 140 lbs, lives alone, and is currently enrolled in school. Additionally, he hasn't held any jobs during the year, has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), but hasn't felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area, and considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break down these factors one by one. The fact that he's been arrested twice and convicted is certainly concerning. This suggests a pattern of behavior that may indicate risk-taking or disregard for the law. However, I also need to consider his age - 18 years old. At this stage, it's crucial to think about the potential for growth and development rather than jumping to conclusions based on past actions alone.\n\nLet me check the other factors... He's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign indicating some level of commitment and possibly future prospects. His living situation - currently alone but previously lived with both biological parents - could be seen as having support systems in place, albeit briefly. The fact that he hasn't held any jobs during the year might indicate unemployment or perhaps an intention to further his education or training.\n\nNow, considering his substance use history... While it's concerning, I also need to think about the context and whether this is indicative of a deeper issue or just a phase in life. And then there's his belief in God - this could be seen as a stabilizing factor or potentially something that influences his decision-making process.\n\nLet me think about how all these factors come together... Given his age, the fact that he's been arrested twice and convicted, and his history of substance use, it seems like there are several red flags. However, I also need to balance this with the positive aspects, such as being enrolled in school and having a support system.\n\nWait, let me evaluate my confidence level... After carefully considering all these factors, I believe that while there are significant concerns, they don't necessarily indicate high risk across the board. It's more nuanced than a simple yes or no.\n\nAfter careful analysis, I've decided to predict \"YES\" with a moderate level of confidence, recognizing that this is not an absolute prediction but rather a reflection of the complex interplay between these factors.\n\nHere's my final assessment in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
