    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his demographic information:\n- Age: 21 years old - This is relatively young, but age alone doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk.\n- Race: Black - There are no specific racial biases that would automatically classify someone as high-risk based on race.\n- Arrests: 1 time, not convicted - This could be significant, but it's important to note that he has never been convicted. The lack of conviction might suggest a lower likelihood of violent behavior or serious criminal activity.\n\nNext, let's consider his physical attributes:\n- Height and weight: 5 feet 7 inches, 148 lbs - These are average measurements and don't indicate any specific risk factors.\n- Living situation: Currently living alone - This is neutral in terms of risk assessment.\n\nEducation and employment:\n- High school diploma, not enrolled in college - This suggests a lower level of education and possibly limited career opportunities. However, it's important to remember that education does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n- 2 jobs during the year - This indicates some level of employment stability, which is generally positive.\n\nHealth and mental well-being:\n- No drug use in the past four years - This is a strong indicator of low risk for substance-related crimes or behaviors.\n- No depression over the past month - This suggests good mental health, which is also indicative of lower risk.\n\nFamily background:\n- Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5, urban area - This information could be relevant if there are known familial influences on criminal behavior. However, without specific details about family dynamics or history, it's hard to draw conclusions.\n- Belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally - This belief system might influence his actions and decisions, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk.\n\nLet me think... After carefully considering all these factors, I realize that while there are some neutral or positive aspects, the overall picture suggests a relatively low-risk profile. The lack of convictions, no drug use, good mental health, and stable living situation all point towards a lower likelihood of engaging in serious criminal behavior.\n\nWait a minute... Given the information provided, it seems reasonable to conclude that this individual does not indicate high risk for criminal activity.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
