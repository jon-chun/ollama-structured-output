    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his age and gender. At 18 years old, he is still a young adult, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence his behavior and decision-making. However, this alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk; it just sets the context for potential vulnerabilities.\n\nNext, his arrest record. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because an arrest can be a wake-up call, indicating some level of involvement in potentially risky behaviors or situations. However, without conviction, it's harder to gauge the severity of any actions taken.\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward and don't seem to indicate any high-risk behavior directly. The height and weight are typical for his age group, and there's no indication of any health issues that could be relevant here.\n\nLiving situation is another important factor. Currently living alone after being raised in a household of six suggests some level of independence but also possibly a lack of support system. This could be a point to consider, as isolation can sometimes lead to risky behaviors.\n\nEducation and employment history are also worth examining. Holding two jobs during the year indicates a certain level of responsibility and financial stability. Not being enrolled in college might suggest a focus on immediate needs rather than long-term goals, but this is not necessarily indicative of high risk.\n\nSubstance use and mental health are critical factors. The fact that he has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month suggests a relatively stable mental state and healthy lifestyle choices. This is a positive indicator for low risk.\n\nLastly, his belief in God and its influence on personal experiences could be seen as a stabilizing factor. It indicates a strong sense of faith and possibly a higher moral compass, which are generally protective against risky behaviors.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. While there are some factors that might suggest vulnerability to high-risk behavior, such as the arrest record and living alone, the overall picture paints a more nuanced picture. The individual has shown responsible behavior in terms of employment and education, and his belief system seems to provide a protective factor against risky actions.\n\nWait a minute... After considering all these factors, I realize that while there are some red flags, they do not outweigh the positive indicators of stability and responsibility. Therefore, my conclusion is that this individual does not indicate high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
