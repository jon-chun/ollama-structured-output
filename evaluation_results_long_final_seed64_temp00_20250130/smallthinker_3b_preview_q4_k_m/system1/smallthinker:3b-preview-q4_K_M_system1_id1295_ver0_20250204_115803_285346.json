    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 18 years old (a young age)\n- Race/ethnicity: Black\n- Height and weight: 4'11\" with a weight range of 150-174 lbs\n\nThese factors alone do not necessarily indicate high risk. However, they are part of the broader picture.\n\nNext, let's look at her criminal history:\n- Arrested 4 times but not convicted\n- Held only 1 job during the year\n\nThis is a significant factor. The fact that she has been arrested multiple times without conviction suggests a pattern of behavior that may indicate risk-taking or involvement in illegal activities. However, since she has not been convicted, it's important to consider this as a single incident rather than a repeated offense.\n\nNow, let's examine her personal life:\n- Never married\n- Currently living alone\n- No high school diploma/GED certificate\n- Not enrolled in college\n\nThese factors suggest a lack of stability and education. Living alone without a significant other or formal education can be indicative of risk, as it may indicate a lack of support system and potential for isolation.\n\nMoving on to her substance use:\n- Used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years\n- Not felt depressed over the past month\n\nThe use of drugs is a concerning factor. However, the fact that she has not felt depressed recently suggests that there may be no current mental health issues driving her drug use.\n\nFinally, let's consider her background:\n- Lived with biological mother in a household of size 5 (urban area)\n- Believes God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally\n\nThe living situation is significant. Growing up in a large household can have various impacts on an individual's life, including potential for trauma or instability. The belief that God has no influence on personal matters may indicate a lack of moral compass or resilience.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. While there are several factors that could be considered high risk, the combination of these factors does not necessarily lead to a definitive conclusion. However, given the pattern of behavior and the significant number of arrests without conviction, it is reasonable to consider her as having a higher than average risk profile.\n\nWait, let me check my reasoning again. The key here is that while there are several red flags, they do not form a clear pattern or indicate repeated criminal activity. Therefore, I will conclude that she does not necessarily have a high-risk profile based on these factors alone.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
