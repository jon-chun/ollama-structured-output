    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his criminal history. The person has been arrested 3 times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past behavior and potential future actions. Conviction rates are often correlated with higher risk levels. So, this factor alone suggests a high-risk profile.\n\nNext, I'll consider his age and physical attributes. At 22 years old, he's in a prime age range for criminal activity. His height and weight might not be directly relevant to the risk assessment unless there's specific data linking these factors to criminal behavior. However, they do provide context about his physical capabilities.\n\nNow, let's examine his personal life. He has never been married and is currently living alone. This could indicate a lack of social support or a history of unstable relationships, which are often linked to higher risk behaviors. Living alone might also suggest a greater freedom to engage in criminal activities without fear of repercussions from family members.\n\nEducation and employment status are also important factors. He has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests limited education and potentially lower socioeconomic status, which can be associated with higher crime rates. Additionally, his history of holding only 2 jobs during the year indicates a lack of stable employment, which might contribute to financial instability and increased risk-taking behaviors.\n\nSubstance use and mental health are critical factors. The individual has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. These positive indicators suggest that he is currently not using substances or experiencing depression, which could reduce his risk profile. However, it's important to note that these factors might change over time.\n\nLastly, his background includes living with his biological mother in a household of size 10 in an urban area. This information provides context about his upbringing and environment, which can be significant in understanding potential influences on behavior. Additionally, his belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally might indicate a strong moral compass or a need for guidance, which could either mitigate or exacerbate risk behaviors.\n\nLet me think... After carefully considering all these factors, I realize that while there are some positive indicators such as no drug use and no recent depression, the overall pattern of criminal arrests, conviction history, limited education, unstable living situation, and significant past behavior suggest a high-risk profile. The belief in God's influence might not directly correlate with risk-taking behaviors but could indicate a need for guidance or a potential factor that influences decision-making.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
