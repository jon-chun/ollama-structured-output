    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 20 years old - This is relatively young, but age alone doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk.\n- Race/ethnicity: White - Again, race/ethnicity isn't directly correlated with criminal behavior without additional context.\n- Arrests and convictions: 1 time - One arrest and conviction could be seen as a minor offense, but it's still a significant factor.\n\nNext, let's look at the behavioral factors:\n- Education level: No high school diploma or GED certificate - This suggests limited educational attainment, which might correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n- Employment history: 3 jobs during the year - Having multiple jobs could indicate instability and possibly involvement in criminal activities.\n- Drug use: Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) - Substance abuse is a clear red flag for high-risk behavior.\n- Mental health concerns: At times, felt so down that nothing could cheer her up - This indicates potential mental health issues, which can be linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\nNow, let's consider the family background:\n- Lived with biological mother in a household of size 3 at a young age - Growing up in a larger household might influence behavior and social dynamics.\n- Belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally - This could indicate a lack of moral compass or higher risk-taking behaviors.\n\nLet me think about how these factors collectively impact the overall risk assessment. The combination of limited education, multiple jobs, drug use, mental health concerns, and family background suggests a pattern of potentially high-risk behavior.\n\nWait a minute... Let's quantify this. Based on the information provided, I would rate the confidence level at 85%. This is because while some factors are significant, others seem less directly correlated with criminal activity without additional context.\n\nFantastic! After careful consideration, I can confidently say that these risk factors indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
