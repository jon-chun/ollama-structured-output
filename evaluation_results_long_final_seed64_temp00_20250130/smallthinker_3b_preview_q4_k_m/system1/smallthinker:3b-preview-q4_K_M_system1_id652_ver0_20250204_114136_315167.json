    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic, has been arrested once but not convicted, and has a range of other characteristics such as height, weight, marital status, education level, job history, substance use, and family background. Wait, let me break this down further - what are the most critical factors that contribute to high risk in criminal justice assessments?\n\nLet's start with the arrest record. The fact that he has been arrested once but not convicted is a significant factor. It suggests some level of involvement with the legal system, which could indicate potential recidivism or a higher likelihood of future offenses. However, I need to consider other factors as well.\n\nNext, his substance use history is also crucial. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and during the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates potential mental health issues or a higher risk of substance abuse-related behaviors. Let me think about this - how does substance use typically correlate with criminal behavior?\n\nFurthermore, his family background is important. He lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 when he was younger and considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests a possible lack of strong social support or moral guidance from family members, which could influence his decision-making.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together - the arrest record, substance use history, and family background - I need to assess the overall risk level. Let me check my criteria for high-risk individuals... Ah yes, it seems that a combination of these factors can indeed indicate a higher risk profile.\n\nGiven this analysis, I believe the person in question does exhibit characteristics that suggest a high risk profile. Therefore, my prediction is that they do indicate high risk. But how confident am I in this assessment? Let me evaluate the confidence level based on the weight of evidence supporting each factor... \n\nAfter careful consideration, I would say my confidence level is 85%. This takes into account the severity and combination of the factors contributing to the risk profile.\n\nSo, after thorough analysis, I can confidently provide my answer in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
