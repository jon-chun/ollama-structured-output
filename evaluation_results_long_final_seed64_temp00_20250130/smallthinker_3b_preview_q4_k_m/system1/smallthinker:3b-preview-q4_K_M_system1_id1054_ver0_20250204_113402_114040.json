    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the information provided: the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic, has been arrested once but not convicted, and has a range of other characteristics such as height, weight, marital status, education level, job history, substance use, and living situation. Wait, let me break this down further - what are the key risk factors here? \n\nIt seems to me that the person's age, Hispanic ethnicity, lack of conviction, and some personal experiences could potentially be relevant. Let me check each factor individually. The fact that he has been arrested once but not convicted is a significant point; it suggests there might be underlying issues or vulnerabilities at play. However, I need to consider this in the context of his other characteristics.\n\nNow, let's think about the confidence level. To determine if these risk factors indicate high risk, I must assess how strongly they suggest potential criminal behavior. Hmm... given that he has been arrested once and has a history of substance use (albeit not currently using), but also has a clean record in terms of convictions, it's a bit nuanced.\n\nWait a minute, what about his personal experiences? The fact that he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area, could indicate certain family dynamics. And the statement about God having nothing to do with his personal life might suggest a lack of moral compass or values. Let me consider how these factors contribute to the overall risk assessment.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I realize that while there are some concerning aspects, such as the arrest and substance use history, the lack of conviction and other mitigating factors like education and job history also play into the equation. It's a complex balance between potential risks and protective factors.\n\nGiven this analysis, my prediction would be that these risk factors do indicate high risk, but with significant uncertainty due to the presence of both positive and negative factors. Therefore, I will assign a moderate confidence level based on the available information.\n\nHere is my refined answer in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
