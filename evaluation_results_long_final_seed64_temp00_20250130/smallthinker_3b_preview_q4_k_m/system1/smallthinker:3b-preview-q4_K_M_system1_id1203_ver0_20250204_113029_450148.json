    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his criminal history. The person has been arrested 4 times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past behavior and potential future actions. Given this, I would rate this factor as very high risk.\n\nNext, his physical attributes: height and weight are straightforward, but they don't directly correlate with risk levels unless there's additional context. So, I'll consider this as low to medium risk.\n\nEducation is another key factor. He has never been married, lives alone, and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate. This suggests limited education and possibly lower socioeconomic status, which could be a factor in his behavior. I would rate this as medium risk.\n\nEmployment history: he has held only 1 job during the year. This indicates unemployment or underemployment, which can correlate with higher risk behaviors. So, I'll consider this as medium to high risk.\n\nSubstance use is another critical area. He has used drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests a history of substance abuse and potential mental health issues. Given these factors, I would rate this as very high risk.\n\nFamily background: he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 when young. While this is an important factor, it's not directly correlated with current risk levels unless there are specific family dynamics at play. So, I'll consider this as medium to high risk.\n\nBelief in God and its impact on personal life is another interesting aspect. This belief might influence his behavior and decision-making processes, but without more context, it's hard to quantify its direct impact on risk levels. Therefore, I would rate this as low to medium risk.\n\nNow, let me synthesize all these factors. The combination of criminal history, substance abuse, unemployment, and limited education suggests a high-risk profile. However, the belief in God might provide some mitigating factors.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the overall risk level is very high.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
