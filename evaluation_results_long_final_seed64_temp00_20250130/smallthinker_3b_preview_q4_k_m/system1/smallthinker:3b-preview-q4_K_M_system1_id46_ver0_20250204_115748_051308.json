    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is within the typical range of ages where individuals are still developing their life trajectories. However, given that he has been arrested once but not convicted, this raises some red flags. The fact that he has never been married and lives alone suggests a certain level of independence, which could be both positive and negative depending on the context.\n\nNext, his physical attributes - height and weight - are within normal ranges for an adult male. This doesn't seem to indicate any significant risk factors related to health or appearance. However, his educational background is quite limited, with no high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college. This could suggest a lack of formal education and potentially lower socioeconomic status.\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held only one job during the year, which might indicate instability or a lack of commitment to any single employer. Additionally, his abstinence from drugs for four years and lack of depression over the past month are positive indicators but do not negate the other factors.\n\nNow, let's consider his background. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 in an urban area at a young age. This could suggest exposure to various influences, both positive and negative, which might have shaped his behavior or worldview. Most notably, he believes that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally, which is a significant personal belief that could influence his actions and decisions.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. Given all these factors, it seems that while there are some mitigating circumstances, the overall profile suggests a higher risk of involvement in criminal activities or other high-risk behaviors. The combination of limited education, unemployment, and a history of arrest, despite not being convicted, paints a picture of someone who may be at risk.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. The lack of formal education and the single job could indicate instability and a potential for criminal activity. The belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life might suggest a certain level of independence or defiance towards societal norms, which could also be risky.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that these risk factors collectively point towards a high-risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
