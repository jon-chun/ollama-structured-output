    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. They have been arrested 5 times and convicted, which is a significant factor in indicating potential recidivism. Wait, let me check the specifics of their arrest record... Yes, it seems that they have a pattern of reoffending, which could be a concern.\n\nNext, I'll consider their demographic characteristics. The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. Let me think about how this might impact their risk level... While there's no direct correlation between age and crime rate in this case, the fact that they are young and have been arrested multiple times could still be relevant.\n\nNow, let's look at their physical characteristics. They are 6 feet 2 inches tall and weigh between 150 and 174 lbs. Hmm... I don't think these specific details will directly impact their risk level, but it's good to note them for context.\n\nMoving on to their personal life, the person has never been married and is currently not living alone. Let me consider how this might influence their risk profile... It seems that they have a history of instability in their relationships and living situations, which could be a concern.\n\nTheir education and employment status are also important factors. They have a GED certificate and have held 2 jobs during the year. Wait a minute... While having a high school diploma or equivalent is not necessarily indicative of risk, holding multiple jobs could suggest financial instability or a lack of stable employment.\n\nIn terms of substance use, the person has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month they have felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer them up. Let me think about how this might impact their risk level... Substance abuse can be a significant factor in criminal behavior, and the fact that they are currently experiencing feelings of despair suggests potential mental health issues.\n\nNow, let's consider their family background. They lived with both of their biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area at a young age. Hmm... This could suggest a history of living in challenging environments or potentially being exposed to violence or substance abuse.\n\nFinally, the person considers that God has something to do with what happens to them personally. Let me think about how this might influence their risk profile... While having strong religious beliefs can be a stabilizing factor, it's not necessarily indicative of high risk behavior.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I believe that they indicate a moderate to high risk level. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of their criminal history, substance use, and personal instability suggests potential for reoffending or engaging in violent behavior.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would predict that the person is at high risk. My confidence level in this prediction is 85%.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
