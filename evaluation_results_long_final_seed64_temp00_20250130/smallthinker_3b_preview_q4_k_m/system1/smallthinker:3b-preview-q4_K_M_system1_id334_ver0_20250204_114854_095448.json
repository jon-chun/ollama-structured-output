    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his criminal history. The person has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant red flag. Conviction rates are typically lower among individuals with no prior convictions, so this factor alone suggests a higher risk of reoffending. I'll assign a high confidence level to this factor, say 80%.\n\nNext, let's look at his substance use history. The individual has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. While this is not necessarily indicative of criminal intent, it does suggest a pattern of behavior that could be linked to impulsivity or other risk factors. I'll assign a moderate confidence level here, say 60%.\n\nNow, let's consider his mental health status. The individual has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that he is currently in a relatively stable mental state, which is positive. However, given his history of substance use and criminal behavior, it's important to note that depression can be a precursor to other mental health issues. I'll assign a moderate confidence level here, say 50%.\n\nLet me think about his family background next. The individual has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. This suggests a potentially unstable home environment during childhood, which could have influenced his behavior and decision-making. I'll assign a high confidence level to this factor, say 70%.\n\nFinally, let's consider his belief in God. The individual considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. While this is an important personal belief, it does not directly correlate with criminal behavior or risk factors. However, it could be seen as a positive factor if we consider the potential for moral guidance and self-regulation. I'll assign a moderate confidence level here, say 40%.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to determine the overall risk assessment. The combination of his criminal history, substance use, family background, and belief in God suggests a high-risk profile. However, the mental health status factor somewhat mitigates this risk.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that the individual indicates a high-risk profile for reoffending.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
