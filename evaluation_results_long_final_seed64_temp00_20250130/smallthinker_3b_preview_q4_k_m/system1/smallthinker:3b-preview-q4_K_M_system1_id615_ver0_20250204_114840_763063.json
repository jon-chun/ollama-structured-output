    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's criminal history. They have been arrested 2 times and convicted, which is a significant factor in indicating potential recidivism. Wait, let me check the specifics of their conviction... Yes, it seems that they have a history of engaging in criminal behavior, which could be a major risk factor.\n\nNext, I'll consider their age and demographic characteristics. They are 21 years old, male, White, and live alone without a spouse or dependents. Let me think about how these factors might influence their risk level... Ah, yes, being young and living alone can sometimes lead to increased impulsivity and potential for substance abuse.\n\nNow, let's look at their educational background. They have a GED certificate but are not enrolled in college. This suggests that they may not be fully engaged with the education system or career opportunities, which could limit their future prospects. Hmm, this is an important factor... I'll make a note to consider it further.\n\nMoving on to their employment history, they have held only 1 job during the year. This indicates limited work experience and potential difficulties in securing stable employment. Let me think about how this might impact their risk level... Yes, having limited work experience can make it challenging for them to find employment, which could exacerbate existing issues.\n\nRegarding substance use, they have used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) but do not feel depressed currently. This is a crucial factor... Substance abuse history can be a significant risk factor, especially when combined with other factors like limited education and employment opportunities.\n\nNow, let's consider their living situation and family background. They lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 as a young person. This suggests that they may have experienced some level of familial support or instability during this time. Wait, let me think about how this might influence their risk level... Ah, yes, experiencing instability or lack of support can sometimes lead to increased risk-taking behavior.\n\nFinally, I'll examine their personal beliefs and values. They consider God has nothing to do with what happens to them personally. This is an important factor... Let me think about how this might impact their risk level... Hmm, it seems that having a strong sense of self-reliance or independence could be both a positive and negative factor.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I need to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me summarize my thoughts... The combination of their criminal history, limited education and employment opportunities, substance abuse history, and living situation suggests that they may be at higher risk for future involvement in crime or other adverse outcomes.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would predict a high risk level. My confidence in this prediction is 85%, considering the cumulative impact of these factors.\n\nHere is my final answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
