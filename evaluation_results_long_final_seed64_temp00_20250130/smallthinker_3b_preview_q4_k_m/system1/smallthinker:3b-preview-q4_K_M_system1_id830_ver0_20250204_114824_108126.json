    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll start by examining the person's background information. The individual is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. This doesn't seem particularly alarming on its own, but it's essential to consider in the context of other factors. Wait, let me check if there are any specific cultural or ethnic risk factors associated with this individual's background.\n\nNext, I'll look at his criminal history. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. This is a significant red flag, as repeated arrests and convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to further involvement in the justice system. Let me think about how this might impact my overall assessment... Ah, yes, I'm starting to see a connection between his criminal history and other risk factors.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical characteristics. He is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 260 lbs. While these details don't seem directly relevant to the risk assessment, they might be useful in certain contexts or for specific types of analysis. For now, I'll set them aside and focus on other factors.\n\nThe person has never been married and is currently living alone. This information could potentially impact his social support network and access to resources, but it's not immediately clear how it relates to the risk assessment. Let me think about this for a moment... Hmm, I'm not seeing a direct connection between his living situation and the other risk factors.\n\nHis educational background is also worth considering. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. While this doesn't necessarily indicate a lack of education or skills, it's possible that he may be limited in terms of career opportunities or access to certain types of training or education. Wait, let me check if there are any specific educational or vocational risk factors associated with this individual's background.\n\nIn addition to his educational background, the person has held only 1 job during the year. This could potentially impact his financial stability and sense of purpose, but it's not immediately clear how it relates to the risk assessment. Let me think about this for a moment... Ah, yes, I'm starting to see a connection between his limited employment history and other risk factors.\n\nThe person has also used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. These details are concerning, as substance use and feelings of depression or despair can be indicative of underlying mental health issues or other risk factors. Let me consider how these factors might interact with each other... Hmm, I'm starting to see a complex web of potential risks.\n\nFurthermore, the person has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3 at a young age. This information could potentially impact his relationships and sense of belonging, but it's not immediately clear how it relates to the risk assessment. Let me think about this for a moment... Ah, yes, I'm starting to see a connection between his childhood living situation and other risk factors.\n\nFinally, the person considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is an interesting detail, as it could potentially impact their sense of purpose or values. Let me consider how this might interact with other risk factors... Hmm, I'm starting to see a potential connection between his spiritual beliefs and other aspects of his life.\n\nAfter carefully considering all these factors, I'm starting to form an overall assessment. The combination of the person's criminal history, substance use, limited employment history, and feelings of despair are all concerning, but they don't necessarily indicate high risk on their own. However, when considered together with his other background factors, including his Hispanic identity, living situation, and spiritual beliefs, I'm starting to see a more complex picture.\n\nLet me think about this for a moment... Ah, yes, I'm starting to form an opinion. Based on my analysis, I would say that the risk assessment suggests a moderate level of concern, but not necessarily high risk. However, I need to be careful and consider all the factors carefully before making a final decision.\n\nAfter re-examining all the information, I've decided that the overall risk assessment is moderate, with some concerning factors present. Therefore, my answer is:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
