    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and consider how they might contribute to a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's look at his age and gender. At 18 years old, he is still a young adult, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence his behavior and decision-making. However, this alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk; it just sets the context for potential vulnerabilities.\n\nNext, his arrest record. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because an arrest can be a wake-up call, indicating some level of involvement in potentially criminal activities. However, without conviction, it's harder to gauge the severity or frequency of such behavior.\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward and don't seem to indicate any particular risk beyond what one would expect for his age and gender. His height and weight are within normal ranges, and there's no indication of any health issues that could complicate this further.\n\nLiving situation is another important factor. Currently living alone after never being married suggests a certain level of independence but also a lack of social support network. This could be a risk factor if he feels isolated or unsupported, which might lead to increased vulnerability to negative influences.\n\nEducation and employment status are also relevant. Holding no jobs during the year indicates some level of disengagement from the workforce and possibly a lack of financial stability. This can be a significant stressor and might contribute to behavioral issues if not addressed.\n\nHis drug use history is clean for four years, which is positive but doesn't necessarily indicate low risk. It's important to consider that abstinence can be a sign of resilience or coping mechanisms rather than a lack of potential for future involvement in substance abuse.\n\nMental health status shows no depression over the past month, which is a good sign. However, it's crucial to remember that mental health issues can manifest in various ways and might not always present with clear symptoms.\n\nHis background living situation with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in a rural area provides context for his upbringing but doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are specific factors related to this environment that suggest otherwise.\n\nLastly, his belief in God having something to do with what happens to him personally is an interesting factor. While faith can be a protective factor against certain behaviors and attitudes, it's not inherently indicative of high risk on its own.\n\nLet me think about all these factors together. The arrest record and lack of employment are significant concerns, but the other factors suggest that he might have some resilience or coping mechanisms in place. However, given the context and the specific combination of these factors, I believe there is a moderate to high risk profile here.\n\nWait a minute... Let me break this down further. The arrest record and unemployment are red flags, but the lack of conviction and clean drug use history suggest that he might be taking steps towards rehabilitation or has other mitigating factors. However, without conviction and with no clear evidence of ongoing involvement in criminal activities, I lean towards a moderate risk profile.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
