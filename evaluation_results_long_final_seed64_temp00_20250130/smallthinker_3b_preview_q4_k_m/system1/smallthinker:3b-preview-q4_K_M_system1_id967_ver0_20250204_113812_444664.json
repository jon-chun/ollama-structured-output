    "raw_message_text": "To answer this question, I need to carefully analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll review the key information provided: the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White, has been arrested once but not convicted, and has a history of using drugs in the past four years. Wait, let me check if there are any other crucial details... Yes, it's also important that he has never been married, lives alone, holds two jobs during the year, and considers God to have something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nLet me break down each risk factor individually. The fact that he's a 19-year-old male who has used drugs in the past four years is concerning. However, I also need to consider his age and the potential for growth or change over time. Hmm... this could be a mitigating factor.\n\nNow, let's examine his educational background - he has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. This suggests that he may have limited formal education and possibly some gaps in his life skills development. But, I should also consider the possibility that he might be self-motivated or have other strengths that could offset this limitation.\n\nThe fact that he's currently living alone without a spouse or dependents is another important point. It indicates a certain level of independence but also suggests that he may not have a support system in place to help him navigate potential challenges. Let me think about how this might impact his risk profile... \n\nAdditionally, his history of being arrested once but not convicted could be seen as a significant factor. However, I need to consider the context and whether there are any underlying issues or patterns that should be taken into account.\n\nAs I continue to analyze these factors, I'm starting to realize that each one contributes to a complex picture of risk. But, how do they all fit together? Let me try to synthesize this information... \n\nGiven the combination of his age, educational background, living situation, and history of substance use, it seems that there are several red flags here. However, I also need to be cautious not to jump to conclusions without considering other potential mitigating factors.\n\nWait a minute... what about his consideration of God in relation to personal experiences? This could indicate a certain level of spiritual or moral guidance, which might help him make better choices in the future. But, how does this factor into the overall risk assessment?\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'm starting to form an opinion on the likelihood of high risk. Let me summarize my thoughts... \n\nBased on the analysis of these risk factors, it appears that they do indicate a higher than average risk profile. The combination of his age, educational background, living situation, and history of substance use, along with his limited support system and past experiences, suggests that he may be more likely to engage in risky behavior or face challenges in the future.\n\nTherefore, my prediction is that these factors do indeed indicate high risk. Now, let me determine the confidence level for this prediction... \n\nGiven the complexity of the factors at play and the potential for mitigating circumstances, I would estimate my confidence level to be around 80%. This reflects a cautious optimism about the likelihood of high risk while also acknowledging the uncertainties involved.\n\nSo, after thorough analysis and consideration, I can confidently provide my answer in the required format:\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
