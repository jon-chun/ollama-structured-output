    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider the demographic information:\n- Age: 18 years old - This is relatively young.\n- Race/ethnicity: White - No specific implications here.\n- Place of residence: Urban area with a household size of 4 - This suggests a family environment, which might be relevant.\n\nNext, let's look at her criminal history:\n- Arrested once but not convicted - This could indicate some level of involvement in law-breaking, though it's not yet been resolved through conviction.\n- Employment history: Held 2 jobs during the year - This shows she has some work experience and is currently living alone.\n\nNow, let's consider her educational background:\n- No high school diploma or GED certificate - This could be a significant factor, as it might indicate a lack of formal education and potentially lower life skills.\n- Not enrolled in college - This further supports the idea that she may not have higher education.\n\nMoving on to mental health:\n- Hasn't used drugs in the past four years - This is positive for her mental well-being.\n- No feelings of depression over the past month - Another positive sign.\n\nFinally, let's look at her personal beliefs and values:\n- Does not consider God to be relevant to what happens to her personally - This could indicate a lack of moral compass or ethical guidance.\n\nLet me think about this carefully. The combination of factors suggests that while she has some positive aspects (like no drug use and no depression), the lack of formal education, limited employment history, and living in a household with four people raises concerns. These factors might suggest a higher risk profile due to potential limitations in life skills and social support.\n\nWait, let me break this down further - the key here is to balance the positive and negative factors. The absence of drug use and depression is reassuring, but the lack of formal education and limited employment history are more concerning.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that these risk factors indicate a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
