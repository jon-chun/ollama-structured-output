    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor provided and determine if they collectively indicate a high-risk profile for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. The person is 22 years old and male. This combination doesn't inherently suggest any significant risk unless there are other factors at play. So, I'll set this aside for now.\n\nNext, he has been arrested twice but not convicted. This is a concerning factor. Arrests can indicate potential criminal behavior, even if convictions haven't occurred. However, the lack of conviction suggests that these incidents might be isolated events or perhaps due to circumstances beyond his control. Let me think about this further... The fact that he hasn't been convicted could mean that he has a clean record otherwise, which is positive. But it's still a significant factor.\n\nHis physical attributes are also important. He is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. These details don't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are specific laws or regulations that consider height or weight in sentencing, which I doubt. So, I'll move on to other factors.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. This could indicate a lack of social support network, but it's not necessarily indicative of high risk. Living alone doesn't automatically mean he's prone to criminal behavior.\n\nHis educational background is also worth noting. He has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. While this might suggest limited education or career opportunities, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal activity.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs during the year. This could indicate instability or a lack of long-term employment commitment, but again, it's not directly linked to criminal behavior.\n\nHis substance use history is clean for the past four years, and he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These factors suggest that he might be in good mental health and has no immediate risk factors related to substance abuse or depression.\n\nThe significant factor here is his background living with a household of size 5 at a young age. This could indicate potential exposure to criminal activities or influences, which is a red flag. It's important to consider how this early life experience might have shaped his behavior or attitudes towards crime.\n\nLastly, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This belief system doesn't directly correlate with criminal activity unless there are specific religious teachings that promote violence or harm, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nLet me check my thoughts again... Given all these factors, it seems that while some of them might be neutral or positive, others indicate potential risks. The arrest history and the early life exposure to a larger household with potentially criminal influences are significant concerns.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that these risk factors do indeed suggest a high-risk profile for this individual.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
