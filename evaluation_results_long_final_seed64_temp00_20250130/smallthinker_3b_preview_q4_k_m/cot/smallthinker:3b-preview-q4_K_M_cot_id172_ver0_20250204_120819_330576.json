    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still in her teenage years, which means there are many developmental aspects that could influence her behavior. However, given her current situation, I would rate this factor as low. The reasoning behind this is that while being a young adult can present challenges, the specific circumstances of her arrest and other factors will likely have a more significant impact on her risk level.\n\nNext, let's look at her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a relatively minor offense, so I would rate this factor as low. The reasoning here is that while it indicates some involvement with the legal system, the lack of conviction suggests that she may be more likely to change her behavior.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical attributes. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 174 lbs. These details don't directly impact her risk level in this context, so I would rate this factor as low. The reasoning is that physical characteristics are not typically used as primary indicators of criminal behavior.\n\nMoving on to her education and employment status. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and has held only one job during the year. This suggests limited educational attainment and recent unemployment, which could be risk factors. However, given the context of her arrest and other factors, I would rate this factor as medium. The reasoning is that while these are significant challenges, they may not directly correlate with future criminal behavior.\n\nNext, let's consider her substance use history. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates a pattern of drug use and recent emotional distress, which are both risk factors. Given these circumstances, I would rate this factor as high. The reasoning is that substance abuse and mental health issues can significantly increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nNow, let's look at her living situation. She has lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This suggests a history of unstable living conditions, which could be a risk factor. However, given the context of her arrest and other factors, I would rate this factor as medium. The reasoning is that while unstable living situations can lead to criminal behavior, they may not directly correlate with future actions.\n\nFinally, let's consider her belief in God. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This indicates a lack of moral compass and potential disregard for societal norms, which are significant risk factors. Given these circumstances, I would rate this factor as high. The reasoning is that a lack of faith can lead to a disregard for the consequences of one's actions.\n\nNow, let's combine all these factors to make a collective prediction. Based on the analysis above, I predict that she will have a 3-year rearrest recidivism risk level of YES with a confidence score of 85%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age and gender\", \"low\", \"At 19 years old, while still in her teenage years, this factor is considered low as it does not directly impact the individual's risk level given the specific circumstances.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"The fact that she has been arrested once but not convicted indicates a relatively minor offense and thus a low risk level for future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Her physical characteristics do not directly influence her risk level in this context, so it is rated as low.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"medium\", \"Limited educational attainment and recent unemployment may be considered medium risk factors due to the challenges they present but also given the specific circumstances of her arrest and other factors.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"high\", \"The pattern of drug use and recent emotional distress are significant risk factors that warrant a high rating for this factor.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Unstable living conditions may be considered medium risk factors due to their potential impact on behavior but also given the specific circumstances of her arrest and other factors.\"),\n    (\"belief in God\", \"high\", \"A lack of faith can lead to a disregard for societal norms, which are significant risk factors that warrant a high rating for this factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
