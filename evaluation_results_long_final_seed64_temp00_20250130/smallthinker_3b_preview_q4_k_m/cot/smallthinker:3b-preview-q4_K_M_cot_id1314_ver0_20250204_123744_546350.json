    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates potential criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the risk might be lower than if he had a conviction record. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNext, his age and gender. Being 21 years old and male, with no specific demographic factors mentioned beyond race, I won't adjust the risk score for these factors. So, this factor remains low to medium.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs 170 lbs. These details don't directly impact crime risk assessment, so I'll consider this a low weight.\n\nLiving in a household of size 5 at a young age could indicate family dynamics that might influence behavior. However, without more specific information on how these dynamics affect his current life choices, I'll keep this as a medium weight.\n\nHis educational background is high school diploma and not enrolled in college. This suggests he may have limited education or job opportunities, which could be a factor. But since he has held only one job during the year, it's not clear if this is due to lack of opportunity or personal choice. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held only one job during the year. This could indicate unemployment or limited work experience. However, without knowing the nature of his job or how long he's been unemployed, it's hard to judge the risk level here. So, I'll keep this as a medium weight.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. These are positive factors indicating low-risk behavior. I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHis belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is an interesting factor. While it's important for personal beliefs, it doesn't directly impact crime risk assessment. So, I'll consider this as a low weight.\n\nFinally, his arrest history and lack of conviction might suggest a lower risk of recidivism compared to someone with a conviction record. However, since he has been arrested twice, the risk is still significant. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in a JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk due to two arrests but no conviction.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"No specific demographic factors beyond race, so low risk.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Tall and heavy, no direct impact on crime risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a large household at a young age, but no clear correlation to current behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma, not enrolled in college, suggesting limited education or job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Only one job during the year, indicating unemployment or limited work experience.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, indicating low-risk behavior.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is a personal factor with no direct impact on crime risk assessment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nThis JSON object reflects my detailed analysis and reasoning for each risk factor, leading to the final prediction of NO for 3-year rearrest recidivism.",
