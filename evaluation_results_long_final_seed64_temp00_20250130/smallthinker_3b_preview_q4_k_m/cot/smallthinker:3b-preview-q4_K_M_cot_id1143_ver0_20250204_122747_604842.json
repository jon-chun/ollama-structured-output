    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is within a typical range of ages where criminal behavior might be more prevalent. However, given that he has not been convicted yet, this factor seems to lean towards a lower risk level. So, I'll assign it as \"low.\"\n\nNext, the number of arrests. He has only been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. This suggests that while there is some criminal activity, it may not be severe enough to warrant conviction. Therefore, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. His height and weight are within a normal range, so they don't seem to pose any significant risk factors. Thus, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nLiving situation is another important factor. He lives alone and has never been married. This suggests he might be more independent and less likely to engage in risky behaviors due to the lack of familial pressure or peer influence. So, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nEducation level is also a critical factor. Without a high school diploma or GED certificate, he may have limited opportunities for education and employment. However, since he has held only one job during the year, it seems that his educational background doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nDrug use is another significant risk factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, which could indicate a higher likelihood of future criminal activity. Given that he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, it suggests that his mental health might not be a major concern at present. So, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nFamily background is also important. Growing up with both biological parents in a large household might provide some stability and support, which could mitigate against criminal behavior. However, since he considers God irrelevant to personal life events, it suggests that there may not be any spiritual or familial influences that could guide him towards law-abiding behavior. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nLastly, his current living situation is one of the factors we've already considered under living situation.\n\nNow, let's combine these risk factors to make a collective prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the mix of low and medium risk factors, with some high-risk behaviors like drug use and limited education, I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nFinally, I need to determine the confidence level in this prediction. Considering all the factors and their weights, I'll assign a confidence level of 60%.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21-year-old male\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"only one arrest, not convicted\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"within normal range\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"lives alone, no marriage\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"no high school diploma or GED certificate\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"used drugs in the past four years\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"grew up with both biological parents\"),\n    (\"current living situation\", \"medium\", \"currently living alone\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"medium\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
