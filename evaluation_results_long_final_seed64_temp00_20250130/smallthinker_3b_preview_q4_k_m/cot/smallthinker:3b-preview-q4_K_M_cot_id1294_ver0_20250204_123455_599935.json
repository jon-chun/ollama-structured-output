    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of criminal activity. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the severity might be lower compared to someone with multiple convictions. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nNext, his age and gender. Being 20 years old and male can influence risk factors related to impulsivity and peer pressure. Given that he's still a young adult, these factors are likely to be significant but not overwhelming. Therefore, I'll label this as \"high.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. His height and weight don't seem to directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nHis marital status is another factor. Being unmarried and living alone might suggest a higher risk of substance abuse or mental health issues, but since he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, this factor seems less critical. So, I'll assign it as \"medium.\"\n\nEducation level is also important. Having a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college indicates a lower likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to higher education levels. Therefore, I'll label this as \"low.\"\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held four jobs during the year. This suggests some stability and possibly a lower risk of criminal behavior. So, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. He has used drugs in the past four years but not recently. This indicates a pattern of substance abuse, which could be a risk factor. However, since it's not recent, the severity might be lower. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nLiving conditions are also important. Living with his biological mother and having a household size of five suggests some level of family support but also potentially higher exposure to criminal influences. So, I'll label this as \"high.\"\n\nLastly, his belief in God is an interesting factor. While it might influence behavior, it doesn't directly correlate with criminal activity. Therefore, I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the collective risk factors and predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the mix of high and medium risk factors, I'll assign a moderate level of confidence in the prediction.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal activity, but not to the extent that multiple convictions would suggest.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"high\", \"Young males are often at higher risk for certain types of crime due to impulsivity and peer pressure.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Unmarried individuals may be more likely to engage in substance abuse or mental health issues, but this is not always the case.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"A high school diploma suggests a lower likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to higher education levels.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held multiple jobs during the year may indicate some level of stability and possibly lower risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of drug use, but not recent, suggests a pattern of substance abuse that could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living_conditions\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of size five may indicate some level of family support, but also potentially higher exposure to criminal influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
