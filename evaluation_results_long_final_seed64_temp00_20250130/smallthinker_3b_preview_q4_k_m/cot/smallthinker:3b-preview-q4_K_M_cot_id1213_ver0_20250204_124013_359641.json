    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still in the early stages of her life, which means that any potential risks might not have fully materialized yet. However, given her young age and the fact that she has been arrested once but not convicted, this could be a significant factor. Let me check the instruction again to ensure I'm considering all aspects.\n\nNext, let's look at her arrest history. She has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is a crucial point because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system, which could suggest a higher risk of recidivism. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, this factor might be considered medium in terms of weight.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical attributes and living situation. She is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 190 lbs, which doesn't seem to indicate any significant health or mobility issues. Living alone with a household size of 5 suggests she has some independence, which could be seen as a positive factor.\n\nHer educational background is also important. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. This indicates that she is actively pursuing education, which can be a mitigating factor against recidivism. However, the fact that she hasn't completed her degree might suggest some level of instability or lack of commitment.\n\nHer employment history shows that she has held only one job during the year. This could indicate some level of unemployment or difficulty in finding stable work, which might be considered medium in terms of weight.\n\nHer substance use and mental health are also important factors. She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These positive aspects suggest that she is currently not using substances and has good mental health, which could be seen as low risk factors.\n\nLastly, her living situation at a young age with her biological mother in an urban area might indicate some level of instability or exposure to negative influences. This factor could be considered medium in terms of weight.\n\nHer belief in God also suggests that she might have a strong moral compass and a sense of purpose, which could be seen as a low risk factor.\n\nLet me summarize these factors and assign weights:\n\n- Arrest history: Medium\n- Physical attributes: Low\n- Living situation: Medium\n- Education: Medium\n- Employment: Medium\n- Substance use: Low\n- Mental health: Low\n- Belief in God: Low\n\nNow, let's consider the collective risk. Given her young age, arrest history, and living situation, I would assign a high weight to these factors. However, her education and mental health suggest some level of stability.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can confidently say that this individual has a moderate risk of recidivism over the next three years.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 19 years old, she is still in the early stages of her life, which means that any potential risks might not have fully materialized yet.
