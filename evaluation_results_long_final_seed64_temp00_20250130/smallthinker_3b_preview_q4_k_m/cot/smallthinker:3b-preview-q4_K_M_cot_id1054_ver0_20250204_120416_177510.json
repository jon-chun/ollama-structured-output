    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male Hispanic individual. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates some level of criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the severity might be lower compared to someone who has been convicted. Let me think about this carefully... Given that he hasn't been convicted and there's no further information on his conviction status, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNext, his physical attributes: height and weight range. These factors are generally not predictive of criminal behavior but can be relevant in certain contexts. For instance, being 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighing between 150 and 174 lbs doesn't seem to indicate any specific risk related to criminal activity. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHis marital status is another factor. He has never been married, which might suggest some level of independence or freedom from certain influences. However, without more context on how marriage affects criminal behavior, I'll keep this at a low weight as well.\n\nLiving situation: currently not living alone and having lived with both biological parents in a household of size 3. This suggests he has had some family support but also might have experienced instability or changes in his living environment. Given the lack of clear predictive value for criminal behavior, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nEducation level is next. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. While education can be a factor in predicting future behavior, it's important to note that many individuals with similar educational backgrounds do not engage in criminal activity. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nEmployment history: he has held only one job during the year. This could suggest some level of unemployment or difficulty finding stable employment, which might be related to his current situation. However, without more context on how employment affects criminal behavior, I'll keep this at a medium weight.\n\nSubstance use is another factor. He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is positive. Additionally, he has experienced feelings of depression but doesn't attribute them to God. This suggests some level of mental health issues that could potentially influence his behavior. Given the complexity and lack of clear predictive value, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nLastly, his background: living with both biological parents in an urban area at a young age. While this might suggest some level of family support or potential exposure to certain environments, it's not directly predictive of criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and make a prediction based on the collective analysis:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal behavior, but given that he hasn't been convicted, the severity might be lower compared to someone who has been convicted.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight range are generally not predictive of criminal behavior.
