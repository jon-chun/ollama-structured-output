    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested six times but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity. However, since he hasn't been convicted, we can't fully assess the severity of these arrests. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, his physical attributes are straightforward: 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 140 lbs. These factors don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll assign a low weight to them.\n\nNow, let's look at his educational background. He has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests limited education and potential difficulties in finding employment, which could contribute to future criminal activity. Let me check the instruction again to ensure I'm considering all aspects.\n\nRegarding his living situation, he lives alone without a spouse or dependents. This factor doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll assign a low weight to it as well.\n\nHis job history is also noteworthy. He has held no jobs during the year. This indicates unemployment and potential financial instability, which could lead to involvement in crime. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has been using them all of the time for the past month. This suggests a pattern of substance abuse that may contribute to criminal behavior. I'll assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nLastly, his family background includes living in a household of size 4 at a young age. While this doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, it's an important factor to consider. Let me check the instruction again to ensure I'm considering all aspects.\n\nFinally, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This is a personal belief and doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's summarize these factors in a JSON object format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested six times but has not been convicted. This suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"These physical attributes do not directly correlate with criminal behavior, so they are assigned a low weight.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"The person has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college.
