    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step and assign a relative weight to each one before using them collectively to predict their 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor that indicates a pattern of behavior potentially leading to future criminal activity. Let me think... Given the frequency and conviction, I would assign this a high weight.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is in a prime age range for criminal activity. Being male also increases the likelihood of involvement in such activities. However, these factors alone do not significantly alter the overall risk assessment compared to other factors. So, I'll assign them a medium weight.\n\nNow, his physical attributes. His height and weight are average, which doesn't seem to influence his risk level directly. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHis marital status is another factor. Currently living alone, this might suggest a higher risk of criminal activity due to lack of social support. However, it's not as significant as other factors. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nEducation and employment are also important. He has a GED certificate but is not enrolled in college, indicating some level of education but no formal higher education. His job history shows only one job during the year, which might suggest instability or lack of commitment to work. These factors contribute to his risk profile but are not as critical as other elements. So, I'll assign them a medium weight.\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. This behavior increases the likelihood of future criminal activity. Given the frequency and type of substance use, I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nDepression is not a factor here, as he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHis childhood living situation is also important. Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area might suggest some level of family support and stability. However, it's not directly linked to future criminal behavior. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability. This is a significant factor that increases the likelihood of future criminal activity. So, I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nNow, let's consider how these factors collectively predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the combination of arrest history, drug use, and belief in personal destiny, it seems likely that he will be rearrested again within three years. Therefore, my prediction is \"YES.\"\n\nFor confidence, I'll assign a high level based on the cumulative analysis.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, the individual is in a prime age range for criminal activity.
