    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 21-year-old male who has been arrested five times and convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested five times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of criminal behavior. Given this pattern, I would assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNext, his conviction status. Being convicted multiple times suggests a pattern of criminal activity. Therefore, I will also assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 0 inches tall and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. While these factors can influence behavior, they do not directly correlate with criminal risk in the same way arrest history does. So, I will assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nHis educational background is another important factor. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests a lack of stability and possibly a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Therefore, I will assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nHis employment status is also significant. He has held no jobs during the year. This indicates a lack of positive role models and potential financial instability, which can increase the risk of criminal behavior. So, I will assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nHis substance use history is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests a pattern of drug use and emotional distress, which can be linked to criminal behavior. Therefore, I will assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nHis living situation is also important. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lack of education and potential instability in his living situation. So, I will assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nFinally, his belief in God's influence on personal life is another factor to consider. While this can provide a sense of purpose and meaning, it does not directly correlate with criminal risk. Therefore, I will assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let me think about how these factors collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the high number of arrests and convictions, combined with his substance use history and lack of positive role models, I would predict a high likelihood of rearrest.\n\nLet's summarize my findings in JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"high\", \"Convicted multiple times indicates a higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Tall height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate, and currently not living alone suggest potential instability.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year indicate a lack of positive role models and potential financial instability.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use and recent feelings of despair suggest a pattern of risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Not married, not living alone indicates potential instability in living situation.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence does not directly correlate with criminal risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
