    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested four times and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given her multiple convictions, I would assign this factor a high weight. Let me check the reasoning behind this: repeated arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\n\nNext, let's look at her age and gender. Being an 18-year-old female, she is in a critical period where early intervention could be crucial. The combination of age and gender can influence recidivism rates due to societal expectations and potential biases. I would assign this factor a medium weight because while it's significant, other factors might have more direct implications.\n\nNow, let's consider her living situation. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests she lives with her family or in a shared household. Living with family members can provide support but may also lead to different social influences compared to independent living. I would assign this factor a low weight because it seems less directly related to recidivism than other factors.\n\nHer employment history shows that she has held only one job during the year. This could indicate instability and possibly a lack of commitment to work, which might be linked to criminal behavior. However, given her current enrollment in school, this factor may not be as relevant. I would assign this factor a low weight because it seems less directly related to recidivism.\n\nHer substance use history is clean, with no drug use in the past four years and no feelings of depression over the past month. This suggests she has been maintaining her mental health and avoiding substance abuse, which are positive factors. I would assign this factor a high weight because it indicates a lower risk of criminal behavior due to good mental health.\n\nHer family background is also important. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area at a young age. This could influence her social and environmental context, potentially affecting her likelihood of engaging in criminal activity. I would assign this factor a medium weight because it provides insight into her early life experiences but may not be as directly relevant to recidivism.\n\nFinally, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally suggests she might have a lower sense of moral accountability or higher self-centeredness. This could potentially increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. I would assign this factor a medium weight because it provides insight into her personal values and beliefs but may not be as directly relevant to recidivism.\n\nLet me summarize my findings:\n\n- Arrest history: high\n- Age and gender: medium\n- Living situation: low\n- Employment history: low\n- Substance use history: high\n- Family background: medium\n- Personal beliefs: medium\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the significant arrest history and substance use history, I would assign a high risk of recidivism.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"Being an 18-year-old female, she is in a critical period where early intervention could be crucial.
