    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male identified as White. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor, but since he hasn't been convicted yet, it might not be as impactful in predicting future behavior. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNext, his physical attributes: height and weight are standard for an 18-year-old male. There's no indication that these factors contribute to criminal behavior, so I'll rate them as low.\n\nLiving situation is another factor. He lives alone and has never been married. This suggests he might be more independent, but it doesn't directly correlate with criminal tendencies. So, I'll also assign this a low weight.\n\nEducation level is crucial. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lack of formal education, which could potentially lead to employment issues and possibly increased risk of crime. Therefore, I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nEmployment history: he has held only one job during the year. This suggests limited work experience and potential difficulties in finding stable employment. I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nSubstance use is another factor. He hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is positive. However, his mental health status is also important. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but he does consider that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests a strong belief system and possibly lower risk of substance abuse or violent crime. I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nFamily background: he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 at a young age. This could indicate a supportive environment, but it's not directly correlated with criminal behavior. So, I'll rate this as low.\n\nFinally, his belief in God and its influence on personal life is an interesting factor. It suggests a strong moral compass and possibly lower risk of crime. Therefore, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and make a prediction:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate impulsivity or lack of planning, but it's not directly linked to future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are standard for an 18-year-old male.
