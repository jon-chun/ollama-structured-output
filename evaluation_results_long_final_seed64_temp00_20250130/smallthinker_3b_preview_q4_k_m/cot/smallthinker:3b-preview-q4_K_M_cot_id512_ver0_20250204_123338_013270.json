    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given that he has already had one run-in with the law, it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to future offenses. Therefore, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his age and gender. Being 20 years old and male, there are specific trends in recidivism rates for these demographics. Young males often face higher risks due to societal pressures and peer influences. This factor also deserves a high weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical attributes. His height and weight don't seem to directly correlate with recidivism rates. However, being 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing 151 lbs might influence how he perceives himself or interacts with others. I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHis marital status is another important factor. He has never been married and lives alone. This suggests a certain level of independence that could either protect him from peer pressure or make it harder to find support systems. Given the context, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nEducation level is also crucial. Holding a high school diploma and not being enrolled in college indicates a lower educational attainment. Research shows that higher education levels are often associated with lower recidivism rates. Therefore, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHis employment history is another significant factor. He has held three jobs during the year, which suggests some level of stability and adaptability. However, it also indicates a lack of long-term commitment to any one job or industry. This factor will be assigned a medium weight.\n\nHis substance use history shows that he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is positive. Additionally, his recent feelings of depression might indicate mental health issues that could influence behavior. Given these factors, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nLastly, his living situation and personal beliefs are important. Living with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 3 suggests a certain level of social support or lack thereof. Considering he lives alone now, this factor will be assigned a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's combine these weights to make a prediction. Given the high arrest history, significant physical attributes, and medium marital status and employment factors, I predict a 60% chance of rearrest recidivism within three years.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"A single arrest and conviction significantly increase the risk of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"Young males often face higher risks due to societal pressures and peer influences.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism rates, but may influence behavior in certain contexts.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate a lack of social support or increased vulnerability to peer pressure.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Higher education levels are often associated with lower recidivism rates, but this individual's educational attainment is not directly correlated with risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs during the year may indicate adaptability and resilience, but also suggests a lack of long-term commitment to any one job or industry.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is positive, but feelings of depression may indicate underlying mental health issues that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation_and_personal_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Living with adults other than biological parents and considering God's role in personal life may suggest a strong sense of community or spiritual guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
