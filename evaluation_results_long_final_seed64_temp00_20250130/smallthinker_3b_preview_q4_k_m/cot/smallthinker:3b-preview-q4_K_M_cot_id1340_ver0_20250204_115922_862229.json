    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. The person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Age and gender can be significant factors in predicting recidivism, but they are not always directly correlated with criminal behavior. So, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNext, he has been arrested once but has not been convicted. This is a serious offense, but since it's not a conviction, the impact might be less severe. Therefore, I'll also assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes: height and weight. These factors are generally not predictive of criminal behavior, so I'll assign them low weights.\n\nRegarding his marital status and living situation, he is currently not married and not living alone. This suggests some level of independence, which might be protective against certain types of crime. So, I'll assign these factors low weights as well.\n\nEducation and employment history are also important. He has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. Additionally, he has held only one job during the year. These factors suggest a lack of education and limited work experience, which could be risk factors for recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign these factors medium weights.\n\nDrug use history: he has not used any drugs in the past four years. This is a positive factor, so I'll assign it a low weight.\n\nMental health status: he has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests good mental health, which could be protective against certain types of crime. So, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHis family background: he lived in a household of size 11 at a young age. While living in a large household can have various impacts on development and behavior, it's not directly predictive of recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability, which could be a risk factor for certain types of crime. So, I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the mix of positive and negative factors, it seems there is a moderate level of risk. Therefore, I'll predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism with a confidence level of 60%.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age and gender can be significant factors in predicting recidivism, but they are not always directly correlated with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"arrested\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate a higher risk of future crime, but the lack of conviction suggests that this factor may have less impact on the prediction.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes such as height and weight are generally not predictive of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Current marital status and living situation can provide some insight into an individual's support network, but it is not a direct predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"A lack of education and limited work experience may indicate a higher risk of future crime, as individuals with fewer opportunities may be more likely to engage in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use history is a positive factor that suggests lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression or mental health issues are also positive factors that suggest lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living in a large household at a young age may have various impacts on development and behavior, but it is not directly predictive of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"A lack of belief in God or higher power may suggest a lower level of moral accountability, which could be a risk factor for certain types of crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
