    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given that he has a criminal record and has been arrested multiple times, I would assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning behind this is the clear pattern of illegal behavior and the likelihood of continued criminal activity.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 22 years old, he is still relatively young, which might suggest impulsivity or a lack of life experience. However, given that he has already been arrested multiple times, it's likely that he has some level of maturity in handling situations. So, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 235 lbs. These details don't directly impact recidivism rates, but they might influence how he interacts with the legal system or how he perceives himself. I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHis marital status and living situation are also important. He is currently living alone and has never been married. This suggests that he might be more independent and less influenced by family dynamics. So, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nEducation level is another key factor. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lower educational attainment, which can correlate with higher recidivism rates due to limited job opportunities and social support. Therefore, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held only two jobs during the year. This suggests instability and possibly a lack of commitment to finding stable work. So, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nSubstance use is another important factor. He has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. However, given his criminal history, it's still a significant risk factor. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nDepression is also a critical factor. He has not felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive indicator. So, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHis childhood living situation is another important factor. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 10, in an urban area. This suggests that he might have experienced some level of adversity and stress during his early life. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nFinally, his belief in God is an interesting factor. While it's not directly related to recidivism, it might influence how he perceives himself and the world around him. So, I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: high\n- Age and gender: medium\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Marital status and living situation: medium\n- Education level: high\n- Employment history: medium\n- Substance use: low\n- Depression: low\n- Childhood living situation: medium\n- Belief in God: low\n\nBased on these weights, I would predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism of \"YES\" with a confidence level of 75.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested three times and convicted, indicating a pattern of illegal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, he is still relatively young, but his criminal history suggests some level of maturity in handling situations.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"His physical attributes do not directly impact recidivism rates, but they might influence how he interacts with the legal system or how he perceives himself.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"He is currently living alone and has never been married, suggesting a lack of family support and possibly more independence.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, indicating lower educational attainment.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"He has held only two jobs during the year, suggesting instability and possibly a lack of commitment to finding stable work.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"He has not used any drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator, but his criminal history remains a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive indicator of mental health.\"),\n    (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 10, in an urban area, suggesting some level of adversity and stress during childhood.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"His belief in God is not directly related to recidivism rates, but it might influence how he perceives himself and the world around him.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
