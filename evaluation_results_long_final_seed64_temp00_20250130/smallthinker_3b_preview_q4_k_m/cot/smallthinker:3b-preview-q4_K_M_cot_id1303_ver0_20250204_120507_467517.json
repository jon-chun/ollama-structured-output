    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given that he has already had two run-ins with the law, it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. Let me think... this factor should be weighted as high.\n\nNext, his conviction. Being convicted once indicates a clear history of breaking the law. This is another strong indicator of future criminal activity. I'll assign this a high weight as well.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. These details don't directly correlate with recidivism rates, but they might influence how he interacts with the legal system or how he perceives himself in society. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHis educational background is another factor. He has no high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests limited education and potential difficulties in finding stable employment. Given his history of arrests, this could exacerbate his situation. I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area at a young age might influence his social environment and potentially lead to delinquent behavior. This factor should be weighted as medium.\n\nHis substance use is another important aspect. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While this alone may not indicate a high risk for recidivism, it could be a contributing factor if he continues to use drugs or engages in other criminal activities related to substance abuse. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHis mental health status is also relevant. He has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that his mental health may not be a significant risk factor at this time. However, it's important to note that depression can sometimes lead to increased risk-taking behavior or criminal activity. Given the lack of current depressive symptoms, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHis belief in God might influence his perception of morality and law enforcement. This could potentially reduce his likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior if he believes in divine guidance. However, it's also possible that such beliefs could lead to increased risk-taking behavior if he feels that his actions are justified by higher principles. Given the limited information, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: high\n- Conviction: high\n- Physical attributes: medium\n- Educational background: high\n- Living situation: medium\n- Substance use: medium\n- Mental health status: low\n- Belief in God: low\n\nBased on this analysis, I can now make a prediction and assign a confidence level. Given the combination of arrest history, conviction, limited education, substance use, and living situation, it's likely that he will be rearrested within three years.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Given his two arrests and conviction, this factor indicates a high likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction\", \"high\", \"A previous conviction suggests a pattern of breaking the law, which is a strong indicator of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"medium\", \"While not directly correlated with recidivism, his physical attributes may influence how he interacts with the legal system or how he perceives himself in society.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and unemployment history suggest potential difficulties in finding stable employment, which could exacerbate his situation.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother at a young age may influence his social environment and potentially lead to delinquent behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Past substance use is a factor that may contribute to increased risk-taking behavior, but it's not a definitive indicator of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"Lack of current depressive symptoms suggests that this factor may not be a significant risk at this time.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_God\", \"low\", \"While potentially influential, the limited information available makes it difficult to assign a high weight to this factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
