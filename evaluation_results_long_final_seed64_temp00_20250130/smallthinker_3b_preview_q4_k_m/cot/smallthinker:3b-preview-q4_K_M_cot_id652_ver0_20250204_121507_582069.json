    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step and assign a relative weight to each one before using them collectively to predict their 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of criminal activity. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the impact might be less severe compared to someone with multiple convictions. Let me think about this carefully... I would assign this factor as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nNext, his physical attributes: height and weight range are within normal limits, so no significant risk here. This factor is \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his marital status. He has never been married and lives alone. This suggests a certain level of independence but also possibly a lack of social support network. I'll assign this as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nHis educational background: he has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. This indicates a lower level of education, which can be a factor in recidivism. Let me think about this... I would assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nEmployment history: he has held two jobs during the year. This suggests some level of employment stability but also possibly limited job experience and skills. I'll assign this as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nSubstance use: he has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and has experienced feelings of depression. This is a significant factor because substance abuse can be linked to criminal behavior. Let me think about this carefully... I would assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nLiving situation: he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 when younger. This suggests a potentially unstable childhood environment, which could have an impact on his life choices and behaviors. I'll assign this as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nBelief in God: he does not consider God to be relevant to what happens to him personally. This is a significant factor because it indicates a lack of moral compass or accountability, which can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. Let me think about this... I would assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the combination of factors, including arrest history, substance use, and a lack of moral compass, I would predict that he is at high risk for rearrest.\n\nFinally, let me calculate my confidence level in this prediction. Based on the analysis, I am fairly confident in this prediction, so I will assign a confidence level of 80%.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal activity, but it's not as severe as multiple convictions.
