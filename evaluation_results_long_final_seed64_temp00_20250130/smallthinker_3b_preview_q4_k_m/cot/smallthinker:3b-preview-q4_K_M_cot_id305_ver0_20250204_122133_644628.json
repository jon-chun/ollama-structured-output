    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for an 18-year-old male who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since he hasn't been convicted, it suggests that the incidents might be isolated or perhaps due to circumstances rather than a pattern of criminal behavior. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, his physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight range. These factors don't directly correlate with risk levels in criminal justice assessments, so I'll assign them a low weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his educational status. He is currently enrolled in school, which suggests that he has some commitment to education and possibly future plans. This factor should be considered positively, but it doesn't significantly impact the risk assessment. So, I'll assign this a low weight as well.\n\nHis living situation is another important factor. Living alone might indicate independence, but it could also suggest a lack of support network. Given that he's currently living alone and has never been married, this factor should be considered moderately. Let me think about this more deeply.\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held only one job during the year. This suggests some instability in his work life, which could potentially impact his financial stability and social connections. However, it doesn't necessarily indicate a pattern of criminal behavior. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), but he hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that while he has engaged with substances, there's no current mental health issue that would significantly impact his risk level. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHis family background is also important. He lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area at a young age. This factor should be considered moderately because it provides some context about his upbringing and potential influences on behavior. However, the specific details about living with both parents don't directly correlate with risk levels.\n\nLastly, his belief in God is a personal aspect that doesn't directly impact criminal risk assessment. So, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the factors analyzed, it seems that while there are some indicators of potential involvement with the legal system and substance use, the overall picture suggests that he is not at high risk for 3-year rearrest recidivism. Therefore, I'll predict \"NO\" with a moderate confidence level.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested twice but has not been convicted, indicating some involvement with the legal system.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight range do not directly correlate with risk levels in criminal justice assessments.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school suggests commitment to education and possibly future plans.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate independence but also a lack of support network, which could impact risk level.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Has held only one job during the year, suggesting some instability in work life.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), but no current depression reported, indicating low risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both biological parents at a young age, providing context for upbringing.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
