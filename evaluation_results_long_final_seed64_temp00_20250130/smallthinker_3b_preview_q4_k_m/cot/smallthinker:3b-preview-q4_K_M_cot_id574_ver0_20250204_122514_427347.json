    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, her age and gender. She is 21 years old and identifies as White. These factors are generally not strong predictors of recidivism on their own but can be considered in conjunction with other factors. For instance, younger individuals might be more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors, while being female could indicate a higher likelihood of substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nNow, let's look at her physical attributes and living situation. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 135 lbs. These details don't directly correlate with recidivism rates but can be part of a broader profile. Living alone might suggest independence, while living in an urban area could indicate exposure to higher crime rates.\n\nEducation and employment status are also important. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, which suggests she is currently engaged in education and possibly working towards a career. However, the fact that she hasn't held any jobs during the year might indicate unemployment or perhaps a preference for studying over work.\n\nSubstance use history is another critical factor. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). This could be a significant risk factor as substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates. However, it's important to note that she hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which might indicate some level of mental health stability.\n\nLastly, her living situation at a young age and her belief in God are less directly related to recidivism but can be part of a broader profile. Living with her biological mother in a household of size 2 could suggest family support or perhaps a history of instability. Her belief in God might indicate a stronger sense of moral compass, which could potentially reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nLet me summarize these factors and assign weights:\n\n- Arrest History: Medium (15%)\n- Age and Gender: Low (5%)\n- Physical Attributes and Living Situation: Low (3%)\n- Education and Employment Status: High (20%)\n- Substance Use History: High (25%)\n- Living Situation at a Young Age: Low (4%)\n- Belief in God: Low (1%)\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given her history of substance use and the potential for mental health issues, I would assign a high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to one arrest but no conviction, suggesting some level of involvement with the legal system.\"),\n    (\"Age and Gender\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as these factors are generally not strong predictors of recidivism on their own.\"),\n    (\"Physical Attributes and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as these details do not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment Status\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to her enrollment in college and lack of recent employment, which may indicate a higher risk of reoffending if she becomes unemployed or dissatisfied with her studies.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use History\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to her history of using drugs in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as this factor does not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as this factor is generally not a strong predictor of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
