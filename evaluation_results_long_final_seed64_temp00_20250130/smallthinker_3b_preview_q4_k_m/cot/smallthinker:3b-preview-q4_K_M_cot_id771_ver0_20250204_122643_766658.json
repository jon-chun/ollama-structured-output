    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant factor that indicates a pattern of criminal behavior. Given the frequency and nature of these arrests, I would assign this factor a high weight. The reasoning behind this is that repeated arrests suggest a higher likelihood of future criminal activity.\n\nNext, let's look at his age and gender. At 22 years old, he is in a prime age range for criminal activity. However, the specific age does not significantly impact the risk assessment beyond general trends. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning here is that while age can be a factor, it is not as directly impactful as other factors like arrest history.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs. These details do not provide significant insight into his risk of recidivism. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight. The reasoning behind this is that physical characteristics are generally not indicative of criminal behavior.\n\nMoving on to his marital status. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. This suggests he may be more independent and potentially more prone to criminal activity due to lack of social support. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning here is that being single can sometimes lead to increased exposure to criminal influences.\n\nNext, let's consider his education level. He has only a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. This indicates limited educational attainment, which may correlate with lower socioeconomic status and potential for criminal activity. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning behind this is that lack of higher education can sometimes be linked to increased risk factors.\n\nNow, let's look at his employment history. He has held only one job during the year. This suggests limited work experience and potentially lower socioeconomic status. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning here is that unemployment or low employment can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates.\n\nNext, let's consider his substance use history. He has not used any drugs in the past four years. This indicates a clean record of substance use, which is generally positive for risk assessment. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight. The reasoning behind this is that lack of drug use can be seen as a protective factor.\n\nNow, let's consider his mental health history. He has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests he may have good mental health, which could reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior due to mental health issues. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight. The reasoning behind this is that mental health status can sometimes be linked to criminal activity.\n\nNext, let's consider his family background. He has lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2 at a young age. This suggests he may have been exposed to certain family dynamics that could influence his behavior. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning behind this is that family environment can sometimes be a significant risk factor.\n\nFinally, let's consider his belief about God and personal responsibility. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests he may have a lower regard for societal norms and rules, which could increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. Therefore, I would assign this factor a medium weight. The reasoning behind this is that lack of respect for authority can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction. Given the high frequency of arrests, limited education, unemployment, and exposure to certain family dynamics, it seems likely that he will be rearrested within three years. Therefore, I would assign this factor a low weight for the prediction.\n\nFinally, let's consider the confidence level. Based on the analysis, I am moderately confident in my prediction. Therefore, I would assign this factor a 60% confidence level.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_gender\", \"medium\", \"Age 22 is within a prime age range for criminal activity, but not significantly impactful beyond general trends.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Tall height and weight do not provide significant insight into risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and currently single may suggest increased exposure to criminal influences due to lack of social support.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma with no higher education suggests limited educational attainment, potentially correlating with lower socioeconomic status.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Only one job during the year indicates limited work experience and potentially lower socioeconomic status.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator for reduced risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression over the past month suggests good mental health, which may reduce likelihood of criminal behavior due to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother at a young age may have exposed him to certain family dynamics that could influence his behavior.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"medium\", \"Considering God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally suggests lower regard for societal norms and rules.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
