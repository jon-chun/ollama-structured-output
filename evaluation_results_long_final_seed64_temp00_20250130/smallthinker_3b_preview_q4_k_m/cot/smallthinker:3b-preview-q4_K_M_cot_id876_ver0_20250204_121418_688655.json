    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old female who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, it might suggest that these arrests are more related to minor offenses or perhaps mistakes rather than serious criminal behavior. Let me check the instruction again to see if there's any specific weight I should assign here.\n\nNext, her age and gender. At 18 years old, she is a young adult who has just turned into adulthood. Being female might influence how she interacts with law enforcement or legal systems differently compared to males. However, this factor alone doesn't seem to carry much weight in predicting recidivism.\n\nHer physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight don't typically correlate with criminal behavior unless there's a specific context that isn't provided here. So, I'll assign a low weight to these factors.\n\nLiving situation is another aspect. She lives alone, which might suggest independence but could also indicate a lack of support network. This factor seems to have a medium weight because it could influence her decision-making and social interactions.\n\nEducation level: she has a GED certificate and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests that she has completed high school but hasn't pursued further education or training. This factor might carry some weight, as higher education can often lead to better job opportunities and reduced likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nEmployment history is also important. She has held no jobs during the year. This could indicate a lack of positive role models or financial stability, which might influence her decision-making. I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nDrug use: she has used drugs in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Drug use can be a significant risk factor for criminal behavior, but the fact that she hasn't felt depressed suggests that there might be underlying mental health issues or other factors at play. I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nFamily background: she has lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4. This could indicate a supportive environment or potentially a history of neglect or abuse, depending on the context. Given the information provided, I'll assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This is a deeply personal and spiritual belief that might influence her decision-making in ways not immediately apparent. I'll assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the mix of factors ranging from low to medium weight, it seems reasonable to predict a moderate likelihood of recidivism. However, without more specific information about her criminal history and motivations, it's challenging to make a definitive prediction.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested twice but not convicted, indicating some level of involvement with the legal system.
