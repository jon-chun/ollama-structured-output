    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested 7 times and convicted. This is a significant number of arrests over a relatively short period. Given that he has been convicted multiple times, I would classify this factor as high. The repeated offenses suggest a pattern of behavior that may indicate a higher risk of future criminal activity.\n\nNext, his conviction history. He has been convicted multiple times, which indicates a clear pattern of engaging in criminal activities. This is another strong indicator of a high-risk profile. Let me check the instruction again to ensure I'm not missing anything crucial here.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. His height and weight are within normal ranges, so this factor doesn't seem particularly significant. It's more about appearance than behavior or risk factors.\n\nHis living situation is another important aspect. He lives alone and has never been married. This suggests a lack of social support and possibly a higher risk of isolation, which could contribute to his criminal behavior. However, I need to consider this in the context of other factors.\n\nEducation level is also relevant. He has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college. While this doesn't necessarily indicate a high-risk profile, it does suggest that he may not have access to higher education or vocational training, which could limit his career options and increase his reliance on criminal activities for financial stability. This factor should be classified as medium.\n\nEmployment history shows that he has held 2 jobs during the year. While this is positive in terms of having a steady income, it doesn't necessarily indicate a high-risk profile. However, given his other factors, I would still classify this as medium.\n\nDrug use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years but does not feel depressed currently. This suggests that while he may be using drugs, there is no current mental health issue that could exacerbate his criminal behavior. Therefore, I would classify this as low.\n\nHis family background is also important. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 and has a history of living in an urban area. This suggests a potentially disadvantaged upbringing, which could contribute to his risk factors. However, I need to consider this in the context of other factors.\n\nFinally, his belief in God is another factor. While it's important for personal beliefs, it doesn't directly indicate a high-risk profile. Therefore, I would classify this as low.\n\nNow, let me summarize these findings and make a prediction based on the collective risk factors:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests over a short period suggest a pattern of behavior that may increase the likelihood of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate a clear pattern of engaging in criminal activities, increasing the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"medium\", \"Height and weight are within normal ranges, but this factor does not significantly impact the overall risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never being married may contribute to a higher risk of isolation and potentially increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not being enrolled in college suggests limited access to education or vocational training, which could limit career options and increase reliance on criminal activities for financial stability.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding 2 jobs during the year indicates some level of employment stability, but this factor does not directly impact the overall risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Using drugs in the past four years but not feeling depressed currently suggests that while he may be using drugs, there is no current mental health issue that could exacerbate his criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother and having a history of living in an urban area may contribute to a potentially disadvantaged upbringing, increasing the risk of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing in God does not directly impact the overall risk assessment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
