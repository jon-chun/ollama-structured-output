    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the factors step by step and assign a relative weight to each one before using them collectively to predict their 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor that indicates a pattern of behavior potentially leading to future criminal activity. Let me think... Given the frequency and conviction, I would assign this a high weight.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is in a critical period where many young adults are still developing their life paths. Being male also influences certain risk factors, but it's not as directly impactful as other factors like arrest history or substance use. Let me check... I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNow, his physical attributes and living situation. His height and weight don't seem to have any direct correlation with criminal behavior, so I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nHis educational background is another factor. He has only a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests he may not be well-equipped for the workforce or able to navigate higher education without support. Let me think... Given his current situation, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHis employment history is also important. Holding 3 jobs during the year indicates some level of employability but also possibly instability and lack of long-term career goals. Let me check... I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, which could indicate a pattern of substance abuse that might influence his behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which suggests he may not be experiencing severe mental health issues related to substance use. Let me think... Given this information, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nHis family background is also significant. Living with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area could indicate various influences on his behavior, including social and environmental factors. Let me check... I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nLastly, his belief in God. This personal belief might influence his moral compass but doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior. Let me think... Given the lack of direct correlation, I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider his past experiences and beliefs. He has lived with his biological mother in an urban area, which could indicate exposure to certain social and environmental factors. However, he considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally, suggesting a strong belief system that might influence his behavior. Let me check... I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nAfter careful consideration, here is the JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior potentially leading to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, he is in a critical period where many young adults are still developing their life paths.
