    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male Asian/Pacific Islander who has been arrested five times but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested five times without conviction. This is a significant factor because it indicates a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity. Given the frequency and lack of conviction, I would rate this as high risk.\n\nNext, his height and weight are relatively average for an 18-year-old male. There's no indication that these physical attributes contribute to higher or lower risk in this context. So, I'll assign a low risk to this factor.\n\nLiving with his biological dad at a household size of two is another important factor. Living with parents can provide support and stability, which might mitigate some risks. However, the specific household structure doesn't seem to directly correlate with increased criminal behavior. Therefore, I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nHis educational background is high school diploma without college enrollment. This suggests a lack of higher education or vocational training, which could potentially limit his career options and increase the likelihood of engaging in crime for financial reasons. So, I'll assign a medium risk to this factor.\n\nUnemployment is another significant factor. Being out of work can lead to increased stress and financial strain, both of which may contribute to criminal behavior. Given that he has held no jobs during the year, I'll rate this as high risk.\n\nHis substance use history includes marijuana use in the past four years. While not a severe issue, it does indicate some level of substance abuse, which could potentially influence his decision-making and increase the likelihood of crime. So, I'll assign a medium risk to this factor.\n\nDepression is another important factor. The fact that he has not felt depressed over the past month suggests that he may be in relatively good mental health, which could mitigate some risks. Therefore, I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nHis living situation is currently alone and not married. This doesn't directly correlate with increased criminal behavior, so I'll assign a low risk to this factor.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a lack of moral or ethical guidance from religious beliefs. This could potentially increase the likelihood of engaging in crime due to a perceived lack of accountability. So, I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction based on these factors. Given the high frequency of arrests and unemployment, along with some other moderate risks, I would predict a 60% chance of rearrest within three years.\n\nLet me summarize my findings in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested five times without conviction, indicating a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"There is no indication that physical attributes contribute to higher or lower risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"living_with_dad\", \"medium\", \"Living with parents can provide support and stability, but the specific household structure does not directly correlate with increased criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"A high school diploma without college enrollment may limit career options and potentially increase the likelihood of engaging in crime for financial reasons.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Being out of work can lead to increased stress and financial strain, both of which may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years indicates some level of substance abuse, which could potentially influence decision-making and increase the likelihood of crime.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"The person has not felt depressed over the past month, suggesting relatively good mental health and a lower risk of engaging in crime due to depression.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone and not married does not directly correlate with increased criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"god_and_morals\", \"medium\", \"The person's belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally indicates a lack of moral or ethical guidance from religious beliefs, which could potentially increase the likelihood of engaging in crime.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
