    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male identified as White. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the severity might be lower compared to someone who has been convicted multiple times. Let me check the scale again - low seems appropriate here.\n\nNext, his age and gender. Being 18 years old is a critical factor in risk assessment because it's a formative period for many individuals. The male identity also plays a role, but I need to consider how these factors interact with each other. Given that he hasn't been convicted yet, the impact might be lower compared to someone who has had more serious offenses.\n\nNow, his physical attributes - height and weight. These are relatively neutral factors unless there's a specific correlation in the data set. Since they don't seem to have any direct link to criminal behavior, I'll classify them as low risk factors.\n\nLiving situation is another important factor. He lives alone, which might indicate some level of independence but also potentially more freedom. However, without further context on how living alone correlates with criminal behavior, I'll keep this at a low risk level.\n\nEducation and employment status are crucial. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, which suggests he's actively engaged in education. This is generally a positive factor as it indicates potential for future success and reduced likelihood of involvement in crime. So, I'll classify this as medium to high risk factors, depending on how the data shows correlation with recidivism.\n\nDrug use history is significant. He has used drugs in the past four years but not recently. This could be a moderate risk factor because drug use can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, especially if it's linked to peer pressure or financial necessity. I'll classify this as medium risk.\n\nDepression status is another important factor. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which suggests he might have some resilience against mental health issues that could influence his decision-making. This seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHis family background is also worth considering. Living with his biological dad in a household of size 5 indicates a certain level of family support and possibly a more stable upbringing. However, without specific data on how this correlates with recidivism, I'll keep this at a low risk level.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is an interesting factor. This could indicate a lower likelihood of being influenced by religious or moral considerations in his decision-making process. Given the lack of direct correlation in the data set, I'll classify this as a low risk factor.\n\nLet me summarize my findings and create the JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating some level of involvement with the legal system.
