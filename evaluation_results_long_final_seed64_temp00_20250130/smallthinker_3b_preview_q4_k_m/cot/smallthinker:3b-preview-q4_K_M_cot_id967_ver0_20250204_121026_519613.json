    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of criminal behavior. However, since he hasn't been convicted, it might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, I'll look at his age and physical attributes. He's 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs. These factors don't seem to directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I would rate them as low risk factors.\n\nNow, let's consider his living situation. He lives alone and has never been married. This suggests a certain level of independence but also a lack of social support. However, this factor is somewhat mitigated by the fact that he hasn't experienced significant life events like divorce or death in recent years. So, I would rate this as a medium risk factor.\n\nEducation and employment are also important factors. He has a high school diploma and has held two jobs during the year. This indicates some level of education and work experience but also suggests a lack of higher education or long-term career stability. Therefore, I would rate these as low to medium risk factors.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) but hasn't felt depressed over the past month. This indicates some substance use but also a lack of severe mental health issues. So, I would rate this as a medium risk factor.\n\nHis family background is also significant. He lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 when he was young. This suggests a potentially unstable home environment, which could influence his behavior and decision-making. Therefore, I would rate this as a high risk factor.\n\nLastly, his belief in God might play a role in his life choices and values. However, it's not directly correlated with criminal behavior, so I would rate this as a low risk factor.\n\nLet me summarize my findings:\n\n- Arrest history: medium\n- Age and physical attributes: low\n- Living situation: medium\n- Education and employment: medium\n- Substance use: medium\n- Family background: high\n- Belief in God: low\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the mix of moderate and high risk factors, I would rate this as a medium to high risk.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of criminal behavior, but it's also possible that the incident was a one-time mistake or minor offense.\"),\n    (\"age_and_physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"The individual's age and physical attributes do not directly correlate with an increased risk of crime.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and having never been married may suggest some level of independence, but also a lack of social support.
