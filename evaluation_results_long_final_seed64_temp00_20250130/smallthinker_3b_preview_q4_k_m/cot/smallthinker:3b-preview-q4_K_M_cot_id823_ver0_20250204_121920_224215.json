    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old female who has been arrested three times and convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given that she has already had multiple run-ins with the law, it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues. Let me think about this carefully... Arrests are a strong indicator of future criminal activity, especially when combined with convictions. So, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNext, her age and gender. She is 20 years old and female. Age can be a mitigating factor in some cases, but given the context of multiple arrests and convictions, it's hard to see how being young might help here. Wait, let me check... No, I don't think age plays a significant role in this scenario. So, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHer height and weight are also factors. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. These physical attributes do not directly influence recidivism rates based on the information provided. So, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nMarital status is another factor. She is married and living with her spouse. Marital stability can sometimes be a protective factor against criminal behavior, but given her arrest history, it's hard to see how marriage would mitigate these issues. Let me think... No, I don't think marital status plays a significant role here. So, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nEducation level is also important. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. Education can be a protective factor against criminal behavior, but given her arrest history, it's hard to see how education would mitigate these issues. Wait, let me check... No, I don't think education plays a significant role here. So, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nEmployment history is another factor. She has held only one job during the year. Employment can be a protective factor against criminal behavior, but given her arrest history, it's hard to see how employment would mitigate these issues. Let me think... No, I don't think employment plays a significant role here. So, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nDrug use is also a critical factor. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. Drug use can be a significant risk factor for recidivism, especially when combined with other factors like arrest history and lack of employment. Wait, let me check... Yes, drug use is a strong indicator of future criminal activity. So, I'll assign this factor a high weight.\n\nLiving situation is another factor. She has lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 6 at a young age. Living with non-biological parents can be associated with higher rates of delinquency and recidivism. Let me think... Yes, this factor plays a significant role. So, I'll assign this factor a high weight.\n\nBelief in God is also a factor. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This belief can sometimes be a protective factor against criminal behavior, but given her arrest history and other risk factors, it's hard to see how faith would mitigate these issues. Wait, let me check... No, I don't think faith plays a significant role here. So, I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let's combine all these factors to make a prediction. Given the multiple arrests, convictions, drug use, and other risk factors, it seems likely that she will be rearrested within three years. Let me think... Yes, based on the analysis, I would predict a high likelihood of recidivism.\n\nFinally, let's assign a confidence level. Based on the strong indicators of past criminal behavior and current risk factors, I would assign a 90% confidence level to this prediction.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to further legal issues.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"Age and gender do not directly influence recidivism rates in this context.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly influence recidivism rates based on the provided information.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marital status does not mitigate the risk of recidivism given the arrest history and other factors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Education level is generally a protective factor against recidivism, but it does not mitigate the risks in this case.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Employment history does not mitigate the risk of recidivism given the limited job experience and arrest history.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use and feelings of despair suggest a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological parents at a young age may be associated with higher rates of delinquency and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not mitigate the risk of recidivism given the arrest history and other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
