    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old female identified as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her age and gender. At 18 years old, she is a young adult who has not yet had many life experiences or opportunities to develop into an independent individual. This suggests that she might be more vulnerable to the influences of her environment and peers. So, I would assign this factor as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nNext, let's look at her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the criminal justice system. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, the risk might be lower than if she had a conviction record. I'll assign this as \"low\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nNow, let's consider her physical attributes and living situation. She is 5 feet 0 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs, which doesn't seem to indicate any significant health or mobility issues. Her current living situation is not alone, but she has never been married and is currently not living with a partner. This suggests that she might be more isolated than others her age, which could increase her risk of engaging in risky behaviors. I'll assign this as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nHer educational background is also important. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This indicates that she has limited formal education and might be more vulnerable to the influences of her environment and peers. I'll assign this as \"high\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nNext, let's consider her employment history. She has held 4 jobs during the year, which suggests some level of work experience but also indicates instability. This could indicate that she is more likely to engage in risky behaviors due to financial stress or other factors. I'll assign this as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nHer substance use history is another critical factor. She has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Additionally, some of the time during the past month, she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up, which suggests depression or other mental health issues. These factors increase her risk of engaging in risky behaviors and potentially committing a crime. I'll assign this as \"high\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nHer family background is also significant. She has lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 10, in an urban area. This suggests that she might be more vulnerable to the influences of her environment and peers due to the size and structure of her household. I'll assign this as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nFinally, let's consider her belief in God. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This could indicate a strong sense of moral values or a higher level of religiosity, which might influence her behavior and decision-making. I'll assign this as \"low\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a collective prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the combination of factors indicating vulnerability to environmental influences, limited formal education, substance use history, and family background, it seems likely that she might be at higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors and potentially committing a crime.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 18 years old, the individual is a young adult who has not yet had many life experiences or opportunities to develop into an independent individual.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"The female gender does not significantly impact risk assessment in this context.\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of involvement with the criminal justice system, but it is relatively low compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"medium\", \"The individual's physical attributes do not seem to indicate any significant health or mobility issues that would increase risk.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"medium\", \"Currently not living alone, but has never been married and is currently not living with a partner.
