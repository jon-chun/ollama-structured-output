    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, her physical attributes: height and weight are straightforward. They don't directly correlate with criminal behavior but can be relevant in certain contexts. For now, I'll assign them a low risk factor.\n\nHer marital status is currently single, living alone. This doesn't seem to have any direct correlation with criminal behavior, so I'll also assign this a low risk factor.\n\nEducation level: she has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. While not having higher education can sometimes be associated with lower socioeconomic status, it's not directly linked to criminal behavior. So, I'll keep this at a low risk factor as well.\n\nEmployment history: she has held two jobs during the year. This suggests some level of employment stability, which is generally positive for reducing crime risk. However, since she hasn't been convicted, perhaps these jobs are in areas that don't require much skill or responsibility. I'll assign this a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use: she has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates substance abuse, which is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior. The recent feelings of despair also suggest potential mental health issues, which can be linked to increased crime risk. So, I'll assign this a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving situation: she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 at a young age. This could indicate some level of family instability or dysfunction, which might correlate with higher crime risk. However, it's important to note that living conditions alone don't necessarily predict criminal behavior. So, I'll assign this a medium risk factor.\n\nBelief in God: she considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This is an interesting factor because it suggests some level of spiritual or moral guidance. While not directly correlated with crime risk, it might indicate a lower propensity for criminal behavior due to the presence of higher values and principles. So, I'll assign this a low risk factor.\n\nNow, let's consider the overall prediction. Given the combination of factors, including her arrest history, drug use, and living situation, I would predict a medium to high risk of 3-year rearrest recidivism. However, since she hasn't been convicted, perhaps the risk is slightly lower. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I'll assign a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level of 60%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of involvement with the legal system, but it's not directly correlated with future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Currently single, living alone does not seem to have any direct correlation with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and no college enrollment does not necessarily indicate higher crime risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Two jobs during the year suggest some level of employment stability, which is generally positive for reducing crime risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of marijuana use and recent feelings of despair may indicate substance abuse and potential mental health issues, both of which can be linked to increased crime risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 3 at a young age may indicate some level of family instability or dysfunction, which could potentially correlate with higher crime risk.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Considering God has something to do with what happens to her personally suggests some level of spiritual or moral guidance, which might indicate lower propensity for criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
