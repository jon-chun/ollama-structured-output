    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested four times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior. Given that he has had multiple convictions, it suggests a pattern of reoffending. Therefore, I would assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 20 years old, he is still in his early twenties, which means there's potential for growth and change. However, the fact that he has been arrested four times and convicted makes it a strong indicator of risk. So, I'll keep this at \"high.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. These details don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, but they might be relevant in certain contexts. For now, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nHis marital status and living situation are also important. He has never been married and is currently living alone. This suggests a lack of social support and potentially higher risk-taking behaviors. However, it's not directly related to criminal behavior. So, I'll keep this at \"medium.\"\n\nEducation level is another factor. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. While education can be a mitigating factor, his current situation doesn't suggest any significant protective factors against crime. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nEmployment history shows that he has held two jobs during the year. This indicates some level of employment stability, which could potentially reduce risk. However, it's not directly related to criminal behavior. So, I'll keep this at \"medium.\"\n\nDrug use is a critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana. While drug use can be associated with increased risk of crime, his current situation doesn't suggest any significant protective factors against crime. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nHis personal beliefs are also important. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests a strong sense of moral values and potential for self-regulation. However, it's not directly related to criminal behavior. So, I'll keep this at \"medium.\"\n\nFinally, his past living situation is relevant. He lived with both biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. While this doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, it does suggest a potentially different upbringing that might influence risk-taking behaviors. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given his arrest history and past convictions, combined with his drug use and lack of social support, it seems likely that he will be rearrested within three years. However, his personal beliefs and employment stability suggest some level of self-regulation and potential for change.\n\nSo, my final answer is:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate a pattern of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"Early twenties with potential for growth, but multiple convictions suggest risk.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Tall and heavy build does not directly correlate to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, currently living alone suggests lack of social support.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma with no college enrollment doesn't suggest significant protective factors.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs during the year indicates some level of employment stability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Used drugs in the past four years, but current situation suggests no significant protective factors.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally, suggesting potential for self-regulation.\"),\n    (\"past_living_situation\", \"low\", \"Lived with both biological parents in an urban household, which doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
