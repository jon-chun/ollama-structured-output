    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old mixed-race female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, her physical attributes: height and weight are straightforward. They don't directly correlate with criminal behavior but can be relevant in certain contexts. For now, I'll assign them a low risk weight since they don't seem to influence the likelihood of recidivism directly.\n\nHer marital status is another factor. Being married might indicate a support system that could help prevent reoffending. However, this also means she has a family to consider, which could complicate her situation if there are issues within the marriage. I'll assign this a medium risk weight because it's a mixed bag.\n\nEducation and employment history are crucial. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and hasn't been working in the past year. This suggests she might be at a disadvantage in terms of job prospects and financial stability, which could increase her likelihood of reoffending if she feels trapped in a situation that doesn't provide opportunities for improvement. I'll assign this a medium risk weight.\n\nHer substance use history is clean, which is positive. However, the mention of feeling down in the dumps suggests emotional distress, which might be a factor in her decision-making process. This could be assigned a low risk weight since it's not directly linked to criminal behavior but indicates potential vulnerability.\n\nLiving in a household of size 4 at a young age could indicate family dynamics that might influence her behavior. However, this is quite vague and doesn't provide clear evidence of criminal propensity. I'll assign this a low risk weight.\n\nLastly, her belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally suggests she might be more individualistic in her outlook. This doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior but could influence her perception of authority or the legal system. I'll assign this a medium risk weight.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism risk. Given the mix of low and medium weights across several factors, I would lean towards a medium risk prediction. However, since she has no prior convictions and is currently employed (albeit not actively), I'll assign a high confidence level.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate some level of involvement with the legal system, but it's also possible that this was a one-time mistake or minor offense.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate to criminal behavior, so they are assigned a low risk weight.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Being married may indicate a support system, but it also means she has a family to consider, which could complicate her situation if there are issues within the marriage.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate and no job in the past year suggest she might be at a disadvantage in terms of job prospects and financial stability, potentially increasing her likelihood of reoffending if she feels trapped in a situation that doesn't provide opportunities for improvement.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\", \"Clean substance use history is positive, but the mention of feeling down in the dumps suggests emotional distress, which might be a factor in her decision-making process.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 at a young age could indicate family dynamics that might influence her behavior, but this is quite vague and doesn't provide clear evidence of criminal propensity.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally suggests she might be more individualistic in her outlook, which doesn't directly correlate to criminal behavior but could influence her perception of authority or the legal system.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
