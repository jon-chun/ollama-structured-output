    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 20-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since she hasn't been convicted, this might suggest that the incident was perhaps a one-time mistake or a minor offense. Let me think about this carefully.\n\nNext, her physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight don't seem to be relevant risk factors in this context. So, I'll assign them a low weight.\n\nNow, let's look at her living situation. She is currently living alone, which might suggest some level of independence but also potentially isolation. This could be a medium-risk factor because it indicates she might not have strong social support networks.\n\nEducation and employment are crucial. She has a high school diploma and hasn't been enrolled in college. Additionally, she has held four jobs during the year, which suggests some level of work experience and possibly financial stability. However, her lack of higher education might be a medium-risk factor because it could indicate limited future opportunities or potential difficulties in finding better-paying jobs.\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has felt so down that nothing could cheer her up during the past month. This suggests she might be struggling with substance abuse issues, which are a high-risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHer family background is also important. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 at a young age. This could indicate some level of familial instability or potential influence from her environment, making it a medium-risk factor.\n\nLastly, her belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences might be considered a low-risk factor because it doesn't directly impact her behavior or likelihood of recidivism.\n\nLet me summarize these factors:\n\n- Arrest history: Medium (due to the incident but not conviction)\n- Physical attributes: Low\n- Living situation: Medium\n- Education and employment: Medium\n- Drug use: High\n- Family background: Medium\n- Belief in God: Low\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the mix of medium and high-risk factors, I would assign a moderate level of confidence.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating some level of involvement with the legal system.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not seem to be relevant risk factors in this context.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Currently living alone may suggest some level of independence but also potentially isolation.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma, no college enrollment, and four jobs during the year indicate some work experience but limited higher education.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use (marijuana) and feelings of despair suggest potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 3 at a young age, indicating some level of familial instability.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may not directly impact recidivism likelihood.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 165 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
