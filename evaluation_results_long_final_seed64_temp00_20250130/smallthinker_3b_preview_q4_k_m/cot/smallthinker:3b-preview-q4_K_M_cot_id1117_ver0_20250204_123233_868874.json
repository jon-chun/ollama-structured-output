    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 21-year-old male who identifies as Black. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice but not convicted. This is significant because it indicates some level of involvement with the legal system. However, since he hasn't been convicted, the impact might be less severe than a conviction would suggest. I'll assign this factor as \"medium\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nNext, his physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior. So, I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his educational background. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests limited education and potential socioeconomic challenges. Given the context of his age and arrest history, I'll assign this factor as \"high\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nLiving conditions are another important factor. He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 when he was young. This could indicate family instability or other environmental factors that might influence behavior. I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nHis employment status is also noteworthy. He has held no jobs during the year, which suggests unemployment and potentially limited social support networks. Given his age and arrest history, I'll assign this factor as \"high\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nSubstance use is a critical factor here. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates substance abuse and mental health issues, which are significant risk factors. I'll classify this as \"high.\"\n\nHis personal beliefs are also important. He considers God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability, which is a significant risk factor. I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nFinally, his gender and race need to be considered in the context of criminal justice outcomes. As a Black male, he may face biases that could influence sentencing or treatment. However, since we're focusing on recidivism prediction, I'll classify this as \"low\" in terms of risk weight.\n\nLet me summarize these factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrest history: medium\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Educational background: high\n- Living conditions: medium\n- Employment status: high\n- Substance use: high\n- Personal beliefs: medium\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the combination of arrest history, educational background, substance use, and living conditions, I'll predict a 3-year rearrest recidivism as \"YES.\"\n\nFor confidence, I'll assign a score of 75.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested twice but not convicted, indicating some level of involvement with the legal system.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate, and no college enrollment, suggesting limited education and potential socioeconomic challenges.\"),\n    (\"living_conditions\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4 when young, indicating possible family instability or environmental factors.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year, suggesting limited social support networks and potentially increased risk of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and experienced depressive symptoms, indicating substance abuse and mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Does not believe God has anything to do with personal experiences, suggesting a lack of moral compass or accountability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
