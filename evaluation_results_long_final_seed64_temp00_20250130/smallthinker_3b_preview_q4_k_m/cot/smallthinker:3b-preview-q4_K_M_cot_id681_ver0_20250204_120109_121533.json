    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. The person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender are generally not significant predictors of recidivism when considered individually. However, they can be part of a broader risk assessment framework. Given this context, I would assign these factors a low weight.\n\nNext, let's look at his arrest and conviction history. He has been arrested once and convicted. This is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, which could influence future recidivism. Therefore, I will assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's consider his physical attributes. The person is 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs between 225 and 249 lbs. These details are not typically used in risk assessments for recidivism. However, they might be relevant in other contexts, such as employment or insurance. Given this, I will assign a low weight to these factors.\n\nMoving on to his marital status and living situation. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. This information suggests that he may have some personal issues or difficulties with relationships, which could potentially influence his behavior. Therefore, I will assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNext, let's consider his educational background. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. While education can be a mitigating factor in some cases, it does not directly predict recidivism. However, the lack of higher education might indicate limited opportunities or challenges in life. Given this, I will assign a low weight to these factors.\n\nNow, let's look at his employment history. He has held only one job during the year. This suggests that he may have difficulty maintaining stable employment, which could be related to his criminal behavior. Therefore, I will assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNext, let's consider his substance use history. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism. Therefore, I will assign a high weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's look at his mental health status. He has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that he may be in good mental health, which could potentially reduce his risk of recidivism. However, depression is also a significant risk factor for recidivism. Given this, I will assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nFinally, let's consider his family background. He has lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This information suggests that he may have had some difficulties growing up, which could potentially influence his behavior. Therefore, I will assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's consider his belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. While faith can be a mitigating factor in some cases, it does not directly predict recidivism. However, it might indicate that he is more likely to seek help or guidance from others. Given this, I will assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nNow, let's consider his overall risk assessment. Based on the analysis above, I can now make a prediction and assign a confidence level.\n\nPrediction: YES\nConfidence: 75\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age and gender are generally not significant predictors of recidivism when considered individually.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Age and gender are generally not significant predictors of recidivism when considered individually.\"),\n    (\"arrested\", \"medium\", \"Past arrest history is a clear indicator of past criminal behavior, which could influence future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"convicted\", \"medium\", \"Conviction history is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are not typically used in risk assessments for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes are not typically used in risk assessments for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Marital status can be a factor in some cases, but it is not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living situation can be a factor in some cases, but it is not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Education level is generally not used as a direct predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Limited employment history may indicate difficulty maintaining stable employment, which could be related to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Past substance use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Mental health status can be a mitigating factor in some cases, but it does not directly predict recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Family background can be a factor in some cases, but it is not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"faith\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may have some indirect effects on behavior, but it is not typically used as a direct predictor of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
