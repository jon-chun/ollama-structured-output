    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male who has been arrested multiple times and is currently not living alone. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested 10 times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of criminal behavior. Given this extensive history, I would assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nNext, his conviction status. Since he has been convicted multiple times, this further supports the high-risk assessment. So, I'll keep it at \"high\" for this factor.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs. These details don't directly impact risk assessment in terms of criminal behavior or recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign these factors as \"low.\"\n\nMoving on to his educational background. He has never been married and is currently not living alone, which doesn't provide much insight into his education. However, he does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests a lack of formal education, which could be a factor. Given this information, I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nHis employment history shows that he has held only 1 job during the year. This indicates limited work experience and potential difficulties in finding stable employment. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"high.\"\n\nNext, his substance use. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). While this is a significant factor, it's not directly related to recidivism based on criminal behavior alone. So, I'll assign this as \"medium.\"\n\nHis mental health status shows that he has not felt depressed over the past month. This suggests no current mental health issues that would impact his ability to commit crimes. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nRegarding his living situation, he is currently not living alone and does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate. These factors don't directly influence recidivism based on criminal behavior. So, I'll assign these as \"low.\"\n\nLastly, his belief in God having something to do with what happens to him personally. This is more of a personal belief and doesn't directly impact risk assessment for recidivism. Therefore, I'll assign this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the extensive arrest history, conviction status, limited employment experience, and substance use, it seems likely that he will be rearrested within three years. Therefore, my prediction is \"YES.\"\n\nFinally, let's determine the confidence level. Based on the analysis, I would assign a confidence level of 80.\n\nHere is the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Extensive arrest history suggests high likelihood of repeat offenses.\"),\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly impact risk assessment for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Limited formal education may influence future opportunities and behaviors.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Single job held during the year suggests limited work experience and potential difficulties in finding stable employment.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of drug use is a significant factor, but not directly related to recidivism based on criminal behavior alone.\"),\n    (\"depression_status\", \"low\", \"No current depression indicates no immediate risk factors for violent or repeat offenses.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Current living situation and education level do not directly impact risk assessment for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Personal belief in God's influence does not directly impact risk assessment for recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
