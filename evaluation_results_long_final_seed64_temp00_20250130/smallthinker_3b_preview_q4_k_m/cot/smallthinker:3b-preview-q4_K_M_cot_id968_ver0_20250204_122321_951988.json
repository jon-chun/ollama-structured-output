    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. The person has been arrested twice but has not been convicted. This is a significant factor, as it indicates a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity. Given this, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 21 years old, he is in a prime age range for criminal activity. Being male also increases the likelihood of involvement in such activities. This factor should be assigned a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 140 lbs. These details don't directly impact his risk assessment but are important for context. I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHis marital status is another factor. Currently living alone, he has no dependents to consider. This should be assigned a low weight as well.\n\nEducation level is also relevant. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. While this suggests some stability, it doesn't significantly impact his risk assessment. I'll assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nEmployment history shows that he has held only one job during the year. This could indicate instability or a lack of commitment to work, which might be relevant. I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has used drugs in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This suggests some substance abuse history, which should be assigned a medium weight.\n\nLiving situation and family background are also important. Living with both biological parents in an urban household might indicate exposure to certain influences. I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is a personal statement but doesn't directly impact the risk assessment. I'll assign this factor a low weight.\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the pattern of arrests, substance use history, and other factors, I would predict a high likelihood of future criminal activity. Therefore, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level of 80%.\n\nLet me summarize this in the required JSON format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested twice but not convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old and male, this individual is in a prime age range for criminal activity and has a higher likelihood of involvement due to gender factors.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly impact risk assessment but are important context details.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone with no dependents, suggesting limited social support and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment indicate some stability but not a significant reduction in risk due to education level.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Only one job during the year suggests potential instability or lack of commitment to work.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, indicates a history of substance abuse which may impact future behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation_and_family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in an urban household suggests exposure to certain influences but does not directly impact risk assessment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
