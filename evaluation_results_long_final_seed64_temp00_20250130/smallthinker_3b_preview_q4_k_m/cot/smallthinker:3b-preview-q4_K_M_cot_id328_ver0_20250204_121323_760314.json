    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once but not convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet, it might indicate that the conviction rate for this type of offense is low. Therefore, I'll assign this factor as \"medium\" because while it's concerning, there's also room for optimism.\n\nNext, her age and gender. At 22 years old, she's still relatively young, which means there's a significant amount of time left in her life where she could potentially reoffend. However, the specific risk associated with being female is not as clear-cut as other factors. I'll assign this factor as \"low\" because while it's important, it doesn't carry the same weight as more direct indicators of criminal behavior.\n\nHer physical attributes are straightforward. Being 5 feet 4 inches and weighing 115 lbs doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nMarital status is another factor. She hasn't been married and lives alone. This could indicate a lack of social support network, which might be relevant in predicting recidivism. However, the direct correlation isn't strong enough to warrant a higher weight. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nEducation level is also important. She has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. This suggests she may not have developed strong educational or vocational skills that could help her avoid crime. Therefore, I'll assign this factor as \"high\" because it's a significant risk factor.\n\nEmployment history shows she has held 3 jobs during the year. While having multiple jobs can indicate employability and stability, it doesn't necessarily mean she won't reoffend. However, the lack of a long-term job could be a concern. I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years, which is positive. This suggests that substance abuse may not be a significant risk factor for her. Therefore, I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nMental health is also important. She has experienced periods of deep sadness, but it's unclear how this will impact her future behavior. Given the limited information, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nLiving situation is another factor. She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4 when she was younger. This could indicate a history of living in challenging environments, which might be relevant. However, without more context, it's hard to assign a strong weight. So, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nBelief in God is also a factor. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally. This could indicate a strong sense of moral obligation or a belief in divine intervention, which might reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Therefore, I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction and confidence level. Given the mix of positive and negative factors, I'll predict that she will likely rearrest within three years with a moderate level of confidence.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate low conviction rates for this type of offense, but it's still a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"While being female is not directly correlated with criminal behavior, it's an important consideration.
