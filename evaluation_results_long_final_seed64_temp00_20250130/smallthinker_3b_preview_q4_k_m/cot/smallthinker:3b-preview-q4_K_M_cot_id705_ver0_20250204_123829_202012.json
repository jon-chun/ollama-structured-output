    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 22-year-old male who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 22 years old, he is relatively young, which might suggest a higher potential for recidivism due to less life experience. However, the risk of recidivism isn't solely based on age; it also depends on other factors like education level and employment history.\n\nNext, his arrest record: he has been arrested once but not convicted. This could be seen as a low-risk factor because being arrested doesn't necessarily mean he will reoffend. However, the lack of conviction is more significant in terms of recidivism risk.\n\nHis physical attributes are straightforward; height and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior. So, I'll assign this a low risk factor.\n\nMarital status: currently not living alone, which might indicate some level of stability but also could suggest independence. This seems to be a medium-risk factor because it doesn't strongly influence recidivism on its own.\n\nEducation and employment history are crucial. He has a high school diploma and held only one job during the year. This suggests limited education and work experience, which could increase his risk of reoffending due to lack of skills or financial stability. So, I'll assign this a medium-risk factor.\n\nSubstance use: he hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a strong indicator of low recidivism risk. However, the absence of depression over the past month also suggests good mental health, further reducing the risk.\n\nLiving conditions and family background are important but less directly related to recidivism. Living with four people at a young age might indicate some level of instability, but it's not a strong predictor on its own. So, I'll assign this a low-risk factor.\n\nBelief in God: while interesting, it doesn't have a direct correlation with criminal behavior, so I'll also assign this a low-risk factor.\n\nNow, let me summarize these factors and make a prediction:\n\n- Arrest record: medium\n- Age: low\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Marital status: medium\n- Education and employment: medium\n- Substance use: low\n- Living conditions: low\n- Belief in God: low\n\nBased on this analysis, I predict that the person will not be rearrested within three years. The confidence level is 70%.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young age may suggest higher potential for recidivism due to less life experience.\"),\n    (\"arrest_record\", \"medium\", \"One arrest, no conviction, suggests low risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone may indicate some level of stability but also independence.\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma, one job during the year suggest limited education and work experience.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years indicates low risk of reoffending due to substance-related offenses.\"),\n    (\"living_conditions\", \"low\", \"Living with four people at a young age may indicate some level of instability, but not strongly correlated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 4.
