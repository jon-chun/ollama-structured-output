    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the 18-year-old male identified as Black. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested four times and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given the frequency and conviction, it seems that he has a high likelihood of reoffending within three years. So, I'll assign \"high\" to this factor.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 18, he's still young and developing. Being male doesn't significantly impact the risk assessment in this context. Therefore, I'll label this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 155 lbs. These details don't directly influence recidivism rates based on physical characteristics. So, I'll classify this as \"low.\"\n\nLiving conditions are another factor. He has lived with both biological parents in a household of size 7 in a rural area. This suggests a potentially unstable environment, which could contribute to his behavior. However, it's not directly linked to recidivism rates. Therefore, I'll label this as \"medium.\"\n\nHis educational status is also important. He is currently enrolled in school and has been attending for some time. This indicates that he is actively engaged with society and has a support system. So, I'll assign \"low\" to this factor.\n\nEmployment history is another key aspect. He has held no jobs during the year. This suggests a lack of work experience and potential difficulties in finding employment upon release. Therefore, I'll label this as \"high.\"\n\nHis substance use is minimal, but he has experienced periods of depression. While not directly linked to recidivism, it does indicate mental health issues that could influence behavior. So, I'll classify this as \"medium.\"\n\nLastly, his belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences is a unique factor. It suggests a strong sense of spirituality, which might provide emotional support but doesn't directly impact recidivism rates. Therefore, I'll label this as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to make a prediction. Given the high arrest history, lack of employment, and potential mental health issues, it seems likely that he will reoffend within three years. So, my prediction is \"YES.\"\n\nFinally, let's assign a confidence level based on the analysis. Considering all factors, I'll assign a 75% confidence level.\n\nHere's the final JSON object:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested four times and convicted, indicating a high likelihood of reoffending within three years.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"While age is a factor in recidivism, it does not significantly impact the risk assessment in this context.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes do not directly influence recidivism rates based on this information.\"),\n    (\"living_conditions\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in a large household may indicate unstable living conditions, potentially contributing to behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school suggests an active engagement with society and potential support system.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"No jobs during the year indicates a lack of work experience and potential difficulties in finding employment upon release.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Minimal substance use, but periods of depression may indicate underlying mental health issues that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"spiritual_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God does not directly impact recidivism rates based on this information.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
