    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 19-year-old female who has been arrested once, convicted, and is currently enrolled in a 2-year college. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor, but it's important to note that conviction alone doesn't necessarily predict future behavior without considering other factors. So, I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nNext, her age and gender. At 19 years old, she is still in the early stages of her life, which might suggest less experience with criminal activities. However, given her arrest history, it's important to consider this factor carefully. I'll also assign this a medium weight.\n\nHer physical attributes are straightforward: height and weight don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nMarital status is another factor. She has never been married, which might suggest independence or a lack of familial influence. This seems to be a low-risk factor for recidivism.\n\nLiving situation is also important. Currently not living alone and having lived in an urban area with a large household suggests she might have had some exposure to different environments but doesn't necessarily indicate criminal behavior. I'll assign this a medium weight.\n\nEducation level is significant. She has no high school diploma or GED certificate, which could be a factor for recidivism due to limited educational opportunities and potential lack of life skills. This will be assigned a medium weight.\n\nEmployment history shows she has held only one job during the year, which might indicate instability but doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nDrug use is a critical factor. She has used drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This suggests she might be experiencing mental health issues, which could be a significant risk factor for recidivism. I'll assign this a high weight.\n\nHer childhood living situation is also important. Living with both biological parents in a household of size 7 and an urban area might suggest some level of family support but also potential exposure to different environments. This will be assigned a medium weight.\n\nFinally, her belief in God and its relevance to personal experiences is subjective and doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. I'll assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let's consider the collective prediction. Given the combination of factors, particularly the drug use and past arrest history, it seems likely that she might be at risk for recidivism. However, her current enrollment in college suggests some level of self-improvement and potential change.\n\nLet me check my calculations again to ensure I haven't missed anything critical. After careful consideration, I believe a high-risk prediction is appropriate.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to past arrest history but considering her age and potential for change.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as she is still in early stages of life, potentially less experienced with criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to lack of familial influence but considering her current living situation.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to urban area exposure but potential for change.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to limited educational opportunities potentially affecting life skills.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as one job during the year does not necessarily indicate instability or criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"High weight assigned due to past drug use and recent feelings of depression, suggesting potential mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Medium weight assigned due to household size and urban area exposure but potential for change.\"),\n    (\"belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Low weight assigned as subjective belief does not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
