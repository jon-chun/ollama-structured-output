    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his age and gender. At 20 years old, he is a young adult who has likely not yet reached full maturity. This suggests that while he may be developing, there could still be room for growth and change. Therefore, I would assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nNext, the fact that he has been arrested once but not convicted adds a significant layer of risk. Arrests can indicate potential criminal behavior, even if convictions are not yet made. This factor is crucial in assessing his likelihood of reoffending. So, I'll label it as \"high.\"\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. His height and weight seem within the normal range for a male of his age. There doesn't appear to be any significant risk associated with these factors. Therefore, I'll assign this factor as \"low.\"\n\nHis marital status is another important consideration. Currently living alone without being married or having children suggests that he may have more freedom and potentially less familial support. This could influence his behavior and decision-making processes. So, I'll label it as \"medium.\"\n\nEducation level is also a critical factor. With no high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college, this individual has likely faced significant educational challenges. This can impact his ability to secure stable employment and navigate the complexities of society. Therefore, I'll assign this factor as \"high.\"\n\nHis job history shows that he has held three jobs during the year. While this indicates some level of employability, it also suggests a lack of long-term commitment or stability in any one position. This could be a risk factor for reoffending due to potential instability and lack of support systems. So, I'll label it as \"medium.\"\n\nDrug use is another significant factor. Using drugs in the past four years (marijuana) indicates a pattern of substance abuse. While marijuana use alone may not necessarily indicate high-risk behavior, it does suggest a history of drug involvement that could impact his likelihood of reoffending. Therefore, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nDepression is another important consideration. The fact that he has not felt depressed over the past month suggests that he has been coping with life's challenges without succumbing to depression. This is a positive sign and reduces the risk associated with depression-related behavior. So, I'll label it as \"low.\"\n\nHis living situation is also noteworthy. Living with his biological mother in a household of size 5 indicates a close relationship but also potentially a more complex family environment. This could influence his behavior and decision-making processes. Therefore, I'll assign this factor as \"medium.\"\n\nLastly, the belief that God has something to do with what happens to him personally is an interesting factor. While it may provide some sense of purpose or moral guidance, it does not directly impact his likelihood of reoffending in a statistically significant way. So, I'll label it as \"low.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the collective risk factors and their weights:\n\n- Arrested once (high)\n- Male (medium)\n- Height/weight (low)\n- Single (medium)\n- No diploma/GED (high)\n- Multiple jobs (medium)\n- Drug use (medium)\n- Not depressed (low)\n- Household size 5 (medium)\n- Belief in God's influence (low)\n\nGiven these weights, the collective risk score is calculated as follows:\n\n(1 * 0.3) + (2 * 0.2) + (3 * 0.1) + (4 * 0.1) + (5 * 0.1) = 0.6\n\nBased on this score and the individual's history, I would predict a high likelihood of reoffending.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adult with potential for growth\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male with potential for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Within normal range\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Single with potential for instability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No diploma/GED, potential for unemployment\"),\n    (\"jobs\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs, potential for instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of marijuana use\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Household size 5\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
