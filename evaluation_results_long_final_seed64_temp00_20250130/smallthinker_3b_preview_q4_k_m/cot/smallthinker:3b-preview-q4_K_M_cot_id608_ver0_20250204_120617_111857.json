    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old female who has been arrested three times and convicted. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider her arrest history. She has been arrested three times and convicted. This is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. Given the frequency of these incidents, I would assign this factor a high weight. Let me check my reasoning again - repeated arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to future offenses.\n\nNext, let's look at her conviction history. She has been convicted multiple times. This is another strong indicator of increased risk. The fact that she has not served any time in prison might also be a factor, but given the context of frequent convictions and no incarceration, I will still assign this a high weight. Let me think about this - repeated convictions without serving time could indicate a pattern of non-compliance with legal systems.\n\nNow, let's consider her age at first arrest. She was arrested at a young age, which is a significant factor in predicting recidivism. This suggests that she may have been influenced by external factors early on. I will assign this a medium weight, as the impact might vary based on individual circumstances and support systems.\n\nHer biological mother's influence is another important factor. Living with her biological mother at a young age could have had an impact on her behavior. However, given the context of living in a household of size 3, it's hard to quantify this influence directly. I will assign this a low weight, as the direct link to recidivism is less clear.\n\nHer substance use history is also relevant. She has used drugs in the past four years, which could be a factor in predicting recidivism. However, given that she hasn't felt depressed over the past month and has not been arrested for drug-related offenses, I will assign this a low weight.\n\nHer education level is another factor. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. This suggests limited educational attainment, which could be a barrier to rehabilitation. However, given her employment history, it's hard to quantify the direct impact on recidivism. I will assign this a medium weight.\n\nHer employment history is also important. She has held 3 jobs during the year, which suggests some level of employability but not extensive experience. This could be a factor in predicting recidivism, as stable employment can provide support and structure. However, given her limited education and no incarceration record, I will assign this a medium weight.\n\nHer living situation is another factor. She lives alone, which might suggest independence but also potential isolation. Given the context of living alone without any other significant factors, I will assign this a low weight.\n\nFinally, her belief in God's influence on personal life is an interesting factor. This could be seen as a positive factor, potentially indicating a strong support system and moral compass. However, given the context of repeated arrests and convictions, it's hard to quantify the direct impact on recidivism. I will assign this a low weight.\n\nNow, let me summarize my findings in a JSON object format:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Repeated arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to future offenses.\"),\n    (\"conviction_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple convictions indicate increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_at_first_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Young age at first arrest may have influenced behavior, but the impact is less clear.\"),\n    (\"biological_mother_influence\", \"low\", \"Limited information on biological mother's influence makes it difficult to quantify its impact on recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"low\", \"No recent depression or drug-related arrests suggest limited substance use impact on recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Limited education may be a barrier to rehabilitation, but the direct link to recidivism is less clear.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"3 jobs during the year suggest some level of employability, but not extensive experience.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone suggests independence, but potential isolation also exists.\"),\n    (\"god_influence\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is a personal factor that may have a positive impact on behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
