    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for the individual in question. Let me break down the process step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. He has been arrested twice and convicted. This is a significant factor that indicates a pattern of behavior potentially leading to future criminal activity. Given the frequency and conviction, I would assign this factor a high weight.\n\nNext, his age and gender. At 22 years old, he is in a prime age range for criminal activity. Being male also increases the likelihood of involvement in such activities. This factor should be assigned a medium weight.\n\nNow, let's look at his physical attributes. He is 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 190 lbs. These details don't directly correlate with criminal behavior but are important for understanding his physical capabilities. I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nHis educational background is another factor to consider. Holding a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 2-year college suggests he has some education and possibly better life prospects. This should be assigned a medium weight.\n\nEmployment history shows that he has held only one job during the year, which might indicate instability or lack of commitment. This factor should also be assigned a medium weight.\n\nSubstance use is another critical factor. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. These positive indicators suggest no substance abuse issues and good mental health. I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nLiving situation is an interesting aspect. He has lived with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. This could indicate exposure to different social environments but doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior. I would assign this factor a medium weight.\n\nFinally, his belief that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally is a personal statement that doesn't directly impact his risk assessment. However, it's important for understanding his perspective on life and potential influences. I would assign this factor a low weight.\n\nLet me summarize the weights:\n\n- Arrest history: high\n- Age and gender: medium\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Educational background: medium\n- Employment history: medium\n- Substance use: low\n- Living situation: medium\n- Belief in God: low\n\nNow, let's combine these factors to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the high weight of arrest history and living situation, along with medium weights for age, gender, education, employment, and belief in God, I would assign a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level of 75.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a pattern of behavior that may lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, the individual is in a prime age range for criminal activity.
