    "raw_message_text": "To answer this, I need to carefully analyze each risk factor for a 22-year-old male who has been arrested six times and convicted. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, let's consider his arrest history. The individual has been arrested six times and convicted. This is a significant indicator of criminal behavior. Given this pattern, I would assign a high weight to this factor. It suggests a strong likelihood of continued criminal activity in the future.\n\nNext, his conviction status. Being convicted multiple times indicates a pattern of breaking the law. This factor should also be weighted as high. The legal system has already deemed him guilty, and this behavior is likely to continue unless he changes his ways.\n\nNow, let's look at his age and physical attributes. At 22 years old, he is still young enough that his life can change significantly with the right support. His height and weight are within a normal range, so no significant weight here. However, his living situation is important. Living with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 2 suggests some level of instability and possibly a lack of strong family support. This factor should be weighted as medium.\n\nHis educational background is another point to consider. He has a GED certificate but is not enrolled in college. While this indicates some education, it does not necessarily correlate with future criminal behavior. So, I would assign a low weight to this factor.\n\nEmployment status is also crucial. The individual has held no jobs during the year. This suggests a lack of work experience and possibly a dependency on others for financial support. Given his age and the lack of employment, this factor should be weighted as medium.\n\nSubstance use is another significant factor. He has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. While not currently depressed, substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior. This factor should also be weighted as high.\n\nHis personal beliefs are interesting. The individual considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This suggests a lack of moral compass or accountability, which could influence his future actions. I would assign a medium weight to this factor.\n\nFinally, his living situation is important. Living in a rural area and having lived with adults other than biological parents may indicate limited social support and possibly a higher risk of criminal behavior. This factor should be weighted as medium.\n\nLet me summarize these factors:\n\n- Arrest history: high\n- Conviction status: high\n- Age: low\n- Physical attributes: low\n- Educational background: low\n- Employment status: medium\n- Substance use: high\n- Personal beliefs: medium\n- Living situation: medium\n\nNow, let's combine these weights to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism. Given the significant pattern of criminal behavior and substance abuse, I would predict a high likelihood of rearrest.\n\nFinal Answer:\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a strong pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"conviction_status\", \"high\", \"Convicted multiple times suggests a pattern of breaking the law.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is still young enough for significant life changes to occur.\"),\n    (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are within normal ranges, no significant impact on future behavior.\"),\n    (\"educational_background\", \"low\", \"GED certificate but not enrolled in college indicates some education, but no direct correlation with future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"No jobs during the year suggests a lack of work experience and possibly dependency on others for financial support.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, which can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"personal_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of moral compass or accountability may influence future actions.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with adults other than biological parents in a rural area may indicate limited social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
