This factor does not strongly indicate high risk.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics:** Height and weight are neutral factors in risk assessment unless they relate to specific behaviors or contexts (e.g., involvement in sports or physical altercations).\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Being unmarried and living alone can be associated with higher risk due to potential lack of social support, but it is not a strong indicator on its own.\n\n5. **Education and Employment:** Having a high school diploma and holding one job during the year are neutral factors. Lack of college enrollment does not inherently indicate high risk.\n\n6. **Substance Use:** Past marijuana use is noted, which can be associated with higher risk depending on frequency and context, but occasional use without other negative consequences is less concerning.\n\n7. **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests stable mental health in that regard, reducing concern for immediate risk related to depression.\n\n8. **Family Background:** Growing up in a household of four with both biological parents can be seen as a positive factor, suggesting some level of stability during formative years.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs:** A belief that God has nothing to do with personal events may indicate a lack of religious influence but does not directly correlate with criminal behavior or risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could contribute to risk (e.g., age, substance use), the individual's profile does not strongly suggest high risk. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty based on available information.",
