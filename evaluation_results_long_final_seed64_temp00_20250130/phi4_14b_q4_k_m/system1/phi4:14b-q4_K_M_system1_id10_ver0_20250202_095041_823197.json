    "raw_message_text": "```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Age and Gender:** At 22 years old, the individual is relatively young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity but also a greater potential for rehabilitation.\n\n2. **Criminal History:** The person has been arrested once and convicted, indicating some involvement in criminal activity, but not an extensive history of recidivism.\n\n3. **Physical Characteristics:** Height and weight are typical and do not inherently indicate risk.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Situation:** Being unmarried and living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to lack of social support, but it is not a definitive factor on its own.\n\n5. **Education and Employment:** Holding a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests positive engagement in education. Having held one job during the year indicates some level of stability or effort towards employment.\n\n6. **Substance Use:** Past marijuana use is noted, which can be associated with risk but is not necessarily indicative of severe substance abuse issues.\n\n7. **Mental Health:** Experiencing feelings of depression (\"down in the dumps\") suggests potential mental health concerns that could contribute to risk if unaddressed.\n\n8. **Family and Social Background:** Growing up in a stable household with both biological parents in an urban area is generally positive, though urban environments can have higher crime rates.\n\n9. **Religious Beliefs:** Considering God's role in personal life may provide a moral framework that could mitigate risk.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile there are some factors that suggest potential risk (e.g., past conviction, substance use, mental health concerns), the overall profile indicates moderate engagement with positive social structures (education, family background) and no extensive criminal history. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" for high risk, with a confidence level of 75, reflecting the balance between mitigating factors and potential risks.",
