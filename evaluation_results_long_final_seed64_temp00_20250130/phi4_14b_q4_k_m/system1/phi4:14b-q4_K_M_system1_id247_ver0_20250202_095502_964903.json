His belief that God influences his life might provide some protective factor but does not negate other risks.\n\n6. **Marital Status:** Being married can be a stabilizing factor, yet it doesn't fully mitigate the risk posed by other factors.\n\nThe combination of these elements suggests a moderate to high risk, hence the prediction \"YES\" with a confidence level of 75%.",
