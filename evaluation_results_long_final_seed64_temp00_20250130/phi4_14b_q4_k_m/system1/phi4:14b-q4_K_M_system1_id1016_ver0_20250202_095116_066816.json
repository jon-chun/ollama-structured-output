This is less indicative of high risk than multiple convictions would be.\n\n3. **Education and Employment**: Lack of a high school diploma or GED and holding only one job during the year are factors associated with higher risk, as they can indicate instability. However, these alone do not necessarily predict high risk without other compounding factors.\n\n4. **Substance Use and Mental Health**: No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators, suggesting lower immediate risk related to substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\n5. **Social and Religious Beliefs**: Living alone and having a belief that God influences personal outcomes can be neutral or slightly protective factors, depending on the context of her social support network.\n\n6. **Household Size in Childhood**: Growing up in a larger household is not strongly correlated with high risk unless associated with other negative factors like abuse or neglect, which are not indicated here.\n\nOverall, while there are some risk factors present (e.g., lack of education and employment stability), the absence of convictions, substance use, and recent mental health issues suggest a lower overall risk. The confidence level is set at 75 due to the presence of both mitigating and concerning factors.",
