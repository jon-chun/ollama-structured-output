Belief systems regarding religion are personal and do not directly correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, while there are some factors that could be concerning (e.g., mental health), the individual does not exhibit multiple high-risk indicators typically associated with recidivism or future criminal activity. The confidence level reflects moderate certainty based on available data.",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
