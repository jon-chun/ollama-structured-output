Having held one job during the year indicates some level of stability.\n\n6. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators for low risk.\n\n7. **Family Background:** Growing up in a household of five in an urban area may have exposed her to certain stressors, but this alone does not indicate high risk without additional negative factors.\n\n8. **Religious Belief:** Considering that God has something to do with personal events can be seen as a positive coping mechanism and support system.\n\nOverall, the combination of these factors suggests a lower risk profile, though some uncertainties remain due to limited data on certain aspects like the nature of her arrest or deeper psychological assessments. The confidence level reflects this moderate certainty based on available information.",
