However, one arrest and conviction do not necessarily indicate high risk without additional context or repeated offenses.\n\n3. **Demographics and Living Situation:** He is living alone and unmarried, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to lack of social support, but this factor alone does not strongly indicate high risk.\n\n4. **Education and Employment:** Enrollment in a 4-year college and holding two jobs during the year suggest stability and engagement in constructive activities, which are protective factors against recidivism or future criminal behavior.\n\n5. **Substance Use and Mental Health:** No drug use in the past four years and no recent depression are positive indicators of low risk related to substance abuse and mental health issues.\n\n6. **Family Background:** Living with non-biological adults at a young age could suggest some instability, but without further negative outcomes associated with this factor, it does not strongly indicate high risk.\n\n7. **Religious Belief:** Considering that God has something to do with personal events can be seen as a positive coping mechanism and source of support.\n\nOverall, the combination of these factors suggests a lower risk profile, hence the prediction \"NO\" for high risk with a confidence level of 85%.",
