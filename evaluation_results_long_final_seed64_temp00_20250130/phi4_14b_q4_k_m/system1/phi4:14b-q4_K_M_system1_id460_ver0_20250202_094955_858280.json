However, an arrest itself can be indicative of potential risk.\n\n3. **Substance Use:** Past use of marijuana and cocaine within the last four years is a significant risk factor for future criminal behavior or substance abuse issues.\n\n4. **Employment History:** Holding 4 jobs in one year suggests instability in employment, which could correlate with higher risk factors related to economic stress or lack of stable lifestyle.\n\n5. **Education Level:** Having only a GED and not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities for upward mobility, potentially contributing to risk.\n\n6. **Family and Living Situation:** Growing up in an urban area with a large household size (6) can be associated with higher exposure to crime or instability during formative years.\n\n7. **Religious Beliefs:** A lack of belief that God influences personal outcomes might correlate with lower adherence to societal norms, though this is more speculative.\n\n8. **Mental Health:** Not feeling depressed in the past month suggests no immediate mental health concerns, which can be a mitigating factor against risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some mitigating factors (e.g., no current depression), several indicators suggest a higher risk profile. The confidence level reflects this assessment but acknowledges that not all factors are definitive predictors of future behavior.",
