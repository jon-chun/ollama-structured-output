He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 230 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\n2. **Confidence**: The person's prediction indicates a high level of confidence in his ability to predict the outcome based on past data (prediction). This suggests that he has a good understanding of probability and statistical analysis, which is essential for risk assessment.\n3. **Probability**: The probability of being arrested increases with each subsequent arrest. For example:\n   - If he was arrested 1 time, there's a 90% chance of him not getting caught (prediction).\n   - If he got arrested 2 times, there's a 80% chance that he will get caught again (prediction + prediction probability) and another 70% chance that he won't get caught.\n\n4. **Probability**: The person has never been married or is currently living alone. This suggests that his relationship with God may not be as strong as it appears, which could impact his ability to predict the outcome of future events.\n5. **Confidence**: The probability increases with each subsequent arrest and conviction. For example:\n   - If he was arrested 1 time, there's a 90% chance that he will get caught again (prediction).\n   - If he got arrested 2 times, there's a 80% chance that he won't get caught again (prediction + prediction probability) and another 70% chance that he won't get caught.\n6. **Probability**: The person has never felt depressed over the past month. This suggests that his mental health is stable and not affected by external factors, which could impact his ability to predict future events.\n\nOverall, based on these risk factors, we can conclude that the person's prediction indicates a high level of confidence in his ability to predict the outcome based on past data (prediction), but also has a moderate level of uncertainty due to his relationship with God and lack of mental health stability.",
