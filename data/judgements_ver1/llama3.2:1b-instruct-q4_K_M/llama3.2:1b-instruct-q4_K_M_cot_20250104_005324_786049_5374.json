    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Given the person's low age (18) and history of arrests, it is likely that he will be rearrested within 3 years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Previous Arrests",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person has been arrested multiple times before, increasing the likelihood of future arrests."

      "factor": "Concurrent Employment",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Employment history is not a significant factor in predicting rearrests, but rather an indicator of stability and income, which may be uncertain for the individual."

    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's upbringing with both biological parents suggests a stable environment, whereas living alone in an urban area without formal support networks increases vulnerability."

      "factor": "Education and Skills",

      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Living alone and having limited income suggest a potential lack of resources or support that could hinder future stability."
