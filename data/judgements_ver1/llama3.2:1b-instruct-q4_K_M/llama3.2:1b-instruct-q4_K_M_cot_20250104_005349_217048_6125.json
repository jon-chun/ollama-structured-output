  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Given the person's age (18 years old) and having been arrested 10 times, this factor is considered high risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "gender",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person identifies as White, which may not be a significant predictor of future arrests in some cases."
    },
    {
      "factor": "conviction_history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being convicted is considered a factor that increases the risk of future arrests, but its weight is medium due to the fact that it's not as clear-cut as conviction history itself."
    },
    {
      "factor": "weight",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being significantly overweight (195 lbs) may be considered a factor with high weight in some cases, indicating higher risk of future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education_level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having never been married and not attending college does not provide clear indication of the person's likelihood to be rearrested within three years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "housing_status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Living alone in an urban area may indicate higher risks, as it can lead to increased exposure and potential for contact with law enforcement or other individuals who could be considered a threat to public safety."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment_status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having held one job in the past year may indicate higher risks, as it can suggest an individual's capacity for future crime and potential exposure to law enforcement."
    },
    {
      "factor": "substance_abuse_history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Previous substance abuse may not necessarily be considered a significant risk factor given the person has never felt depressed over the past month."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age_at_birth",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being born in an urban area and living with biological parents at age 4 may increase individual risks, as it can lead to increased exposure and potential for contact with law enforcement or other individuals who could be considered a threat to public safety."
    },
    {
      "factor": "depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having not felt depressed over the past month may indicate lower risks, as it suggests that the individual is potentially more resilient and less prone to extreme emotions or behaviors that could lead to law enforcement involvement."
    },
    {
      "factor": "living_status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone in an urban area may be considered a factor with medium weight, as it can suggest potential risks due to increased exposure and potential for contact with individuals who could be considered a threat to public safety."

    {
      "factor": "family_status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having never been married may not provide clear indication of the person's likelihood to be rearrested within three years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "religion",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Considering God has a personal role in what happens to individuals, this factor is considered high due to its spiritual implications and potential for increased responsibility."
