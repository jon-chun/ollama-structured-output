    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "As the person is only 18 years old, it's highly unlikely he will be rearrested within 3 years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Sex",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The person is an adult male and has identified himself as White, which may indicate a different risk profile compared to other groups."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Conviction History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Given that the person has been convicted 10 times, this could be a significant predictor of future behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Occupation and Education",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's occupation as a single individual with no college education may indicate limited financial resources and lower social connections, increasing the risk of recidivism."

    {
      "factor": "Marital Status and Living Situation",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being unmarried and living alone may indicate higher stress levels and less social support, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism."

      "factor": "Mental Health and Substance Use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's past use of marijuana and cocaine, as well as a history of depression, suggests that he may be at risk for substance abuse or mental health issues which could contribute to future recidivism."

    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The person's upbringing in a household of size 4 with biological parents and no mention of religion or spiritual beliefs may indicate different values and coping mechanisms compared to others."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religion",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "There is no indication of a religious preference, which could influence the person's worldview and behavior in ways that are not yet apparent."
