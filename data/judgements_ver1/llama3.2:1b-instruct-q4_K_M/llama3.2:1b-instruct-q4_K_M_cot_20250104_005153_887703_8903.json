  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "an individual's age can be a significant predictor of recidivism due to biological and psychological changes that may occur over time."
    },
    {
      "factor": "arrests",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "a person with multiple arrests may be more likely to reoffend, but the exact reason is not clear. However, it's possible that their behavior has become habitual or entrenched, leading to a higher likelihood of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "convictions",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "having multiple convictions can demonstrate to others and oneself that the individual is prone to crime. This may increase the likelihood of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "height",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "being taller can provide a physical advantage in many situations, including fighting or escaping from authority."
    },
    {
      "factor": "weight",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "having a larger weight may indicate a higher BMI, which could be associated with increased strength and resilience in some cases. However, it's not clear how this would impact recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "a person with a GED certificate may have limited access to education resources and support services, which could exacerbate underlying issues contributing to recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital_status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "being unmarried or living alone can increase the risk of reoffending due to lack of social connections, financial stability, and access to support services."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "having a job may indicate financial stability and a sense of purpose, which could reduce the likelihood of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "drugs_used",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "using drugs can be a sign of underlying addiction or substance abuse issues that may require treatment. In some cases, these issues may lead to recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "not feeling depressed over the past month suggests that the individual may not be experiencing underlying mental health issues, which could reduce the likelihood of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age_at_birth",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "being born in a household of size 4 and living with biological parents can increase exposure to negative life events, stress, and trauma, which may contribute to recidivism."
