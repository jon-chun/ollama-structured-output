    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "An 18-year-old is considered a young adult, and rearrests are less likely in this age group."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital Status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person identifies as White, which may indicate that they are more likely to be married or have stable family ties, making it less likely for them to be rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education Level",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A GED certificate indicates some level of education, but not enough to increase the risk of being rearrested. However, this factor does have some impact on confidence in prediction."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Income Level",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The person's income is not provided, so we cannot assess its impact on the probability of re-arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person has held only one job in the past year, indicating a lack of stability or success. This could contribute to an increased risk of re-arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Abuse",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While the person has used drugs in the past four years, it does not necessarily indicate that he will be rearrested. However, if they were to start using substances again or use them in a way that increases their risk, this could lead to re-arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that he is currently in better mental health. This reduces the likelihood of him being rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Dynamics",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Living alone with biological parents may indicate a lack of support or family ties, increasing the risk of re-arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Racial Identity",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's racial identity does not seem to have any significant impact on his likelihood of being rearrested."
