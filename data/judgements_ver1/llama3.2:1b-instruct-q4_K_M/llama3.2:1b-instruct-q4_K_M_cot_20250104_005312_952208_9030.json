    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "As an 18-year-old male, he has a relatively short window to commit crimes and may have not yet developed the necessary life skills or maturity to make better choices."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Convictions",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While being convicted is a serious issue, it does not necessarily mean he will be rearrested. However, it could indicate a pattern of behavior and potentially increase his chances of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Weight and Height",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "His weight and height may contribute to his physical appearance, but they are not directly linked to his likelihood of being rearrested. It's essential to consider other factors for a accurate prediction."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate suggests he has had some education or training, which may indicate a level of maturity and motivation to change his behavior. However, this factor is not directly correlated with reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment History",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While holding only one job in the past year is concerning, it does not necessarily mean he will be rearrested. Employing himself may indicate a level of responsibility and motivation to change his behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Life",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "His family life appears stable, with both biological parents living together in a household of size 4. This stability is beneficial for his mental health and well-being."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Abuse History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Using substances such as marijuana and cocaine for four years suggests he has struggled with addiction, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "He has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating that he may be on the path to recovery or have more resilience than his past experiences suggest."
