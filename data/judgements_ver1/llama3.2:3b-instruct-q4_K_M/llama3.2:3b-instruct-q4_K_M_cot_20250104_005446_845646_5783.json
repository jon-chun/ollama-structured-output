    {
      "factor": "arrest history",
      "weight": "high",

      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "18 years old is considered young for a significant portion of the population, but not so young that it would necessarily mitigate the risk of rearrest"

      "factor": "education level",

      "factor": "employment history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Only held one job in a year, indicating instability in employment, which can contribute to financial stress and increase the likelihood of rearrest"

      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lived in an urban area with both biological parents, suggesting some level of stability at home, but also potentially exposure to higher crime rates"
