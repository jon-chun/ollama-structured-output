    {
      "factor": "Age and Gender",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being an 18-year-old male is a significant risk factor as younger individuals tend to have higher rates of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Criminal History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A history of multiple arrests and convictions indicates a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of future reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment Status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Holding only one job in a year suggests instability or difficulty sustaining employment, which can be linked to higher recidivism rates."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use, especially involving cocaine and marijuana, is associated with an increased risk of criminal activity and reoffending."

    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents may offer some stability, but the risk of reoffending cannot be solely determined by this factor."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing in God's influence does not significantly impact recidivism rates and is a low-priority factor."
