    {
      "factor": "Age and Gender",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being an 18-year-old male puts him in a demographic with higher rearrest rates due to factors like impulsivity and peer influence."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Criminal History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A history of 10 arrests, including convictions, is a strong indicator for future reoffending as it suggests an established pattern of criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) increases the likelihood of rearrest, especially if substance abuse issues are not addressed effectively."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education Level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED is slightly better than no high school diploma but may limit future opportunities unless he pursues further education or training."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment Status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Holding only 1 job in the past year might indicate instability, but it's not a significant predictor on its own without more context."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up with both biological parents and in an urban area could provide some stability, but living alone now may be a risk factor for social isolation."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Personal Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing in God's influence is not typically associated with rearrest rates. It might indicate a source of support, which can be beneficial."
