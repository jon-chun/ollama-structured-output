    {
      "factor": "Criminal History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "10 arrests and a conviction history indicate an established criminal past which is likely to influence future behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being 18, the individual may be more impulsive with less mature decision-making skills compared to older adults. However, this factor alone doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) can be an indicator of potential future substance abuse issues which may lead to criminal activity. However, the absence of recent depression indicates some level of resilience or support."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education Level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED and not being in college doesn't directly suggest a higher risk factor on its own unless there are associated issues with low educational attainment or lack of opportunities."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living Situation",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Currently living alone may indicate some level of independence and responsibility, but it's not a strong indicator of future rearrest risk without more context on the individual's support system or social connections."
