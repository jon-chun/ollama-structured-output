  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Criminal History and Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A significant criminal history with multiple arrests (10 times) and a conviction is a strong indicator of potential future re-offending. Previous convictions are often seen as one of the strongest predictors of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being 18 years old may be considered young, but it is a relatively low risk factor compared to being a juvenile or an adult with established criminal tendencies. However, this does not necessarily mean the person will not re-offend."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being male is associated with higher rates of recidivism in general, but it's important to note that gender alone cannot solely predict future criminal behavior. It should be considered alongside other factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Educational Level and Employment Status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate is a positive step towards education, but not being enrolled in college or having limited employment (1 job) can indicate potential instability. Lack of stable employment has been linked to higher recidivism rates."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a notable risk factor as it may indicate ongoing involvement with substances that could lead to further criminal activity. However, the person has not used drugs in the past month, which is a positive sign."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests potential stability and good mental health. This factor may reduce the risk of re-offending compared to individuals with ongoing mental health issues."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in a household with both biological parents is generally considered a protective factor, but living in an urban area can expose an individual to various social and environmental risks. The impact of these factors may vary."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing that God has something to do with personal life events is a subjective factor and its influence on behavior can be complex. It's difficult to determine the direct impact of this belief on recidivism."
