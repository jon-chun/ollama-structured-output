    {
      "factor": "Criminal History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The individual has a significant criminal history with multiple arrests and convictions. This is a strong indicator of future rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being an 18-year-old male puts him in a higher risk category, as younger individuals tend to have a higher propensity for reoffending within a shorter time frame. However, this is not a strong predictor on its own."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Although the individual has used drugs in the past, it's been over four years since their last usage and they haven't shown signs of depression. This indicates a lower risk associated with drug-related offenses."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Educational Status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED certificate and no current college enrollment may indicate a lack of educational opportunities, which could be a risk factor. However, it's not as significant when compared to other factors."
