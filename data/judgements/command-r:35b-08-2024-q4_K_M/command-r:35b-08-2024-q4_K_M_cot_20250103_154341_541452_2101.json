    {
      "factor": "Age and Gender",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The individual is an 18-year-old male. While this age group tends to be more impulsive and engage in riskier behaviors, the impact of gender on recidivism rates is not a significant predictor."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Criminal History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person has an extensive criminal history with 10 arrests. A higher number of previous arrests and convictions are strong indicators of future rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education Level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate is considered a protective factor against reoffending, as it indicates some level of educational achievement. However, not being enrolled in further education may suggest a lack of stable direction or goals."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment Status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Holding one job during the year is a somewhat concerning factor, as it might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. However, this alone is not a strong predictor of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use, particularly cocaine and marijuana, increases the risk of reoffending. This behavior can lead to continued criminal activity or association with individuals involved in illegal activities."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in a household with both biological parents is generally considered a protective factor, but it may not significantly impact the prediction given other risk factors present."
