  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 85,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age and Gender",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The individual's age of 18 is a significant risk factor as this is an age where impulsive behavior is common. Additionally, males are generally more likely to reoffend compared to females."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Criminal History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A history of multiple arrests and convictions significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest. With 10 prior arrests, this individual has a higher chance of reoffending within three years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education and Employment Status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED certificate and being unemployed or underemployed can lead to feelings of frustration and a lack of opportunities, potentially increasing the risk of criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning, not feeling depressed in the recent past suggests that substance abuse may not be a primary driver for potential reoffending. However, it cannot be ignored as a contributing factor."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Growing up with both biological parents and in an urban area is neither particularly protective nor risky. The size of the household (4) is not a significant risk factor either."
