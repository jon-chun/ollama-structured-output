  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Prior Arrests and Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been arrested multiple times (10) indicates a history of criminal behavior. The fact that the person has also been convicted suggests they have previously served time or faced legal consequences, which could influence them to reoffend."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being 18 years old means this individual is at a crucial stage in their development. This age group often faces challenges such as impulsivity and the desire for peer acceptance, which could lead to making poor decisions."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine is concerning as it may indicate an ongoing substance abuse issue. Regular drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living Situation",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Living alone at 18 years old could be a risk factor, but it's difficult to determine without context. It may indicate independence or a lack of support system, which can influence behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education and Employment",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate is positive, but not being enrolled in college could suggest a lack of educational aspirations. Holding only one job during the year might indicate instability or difficulty sustaining employment."
