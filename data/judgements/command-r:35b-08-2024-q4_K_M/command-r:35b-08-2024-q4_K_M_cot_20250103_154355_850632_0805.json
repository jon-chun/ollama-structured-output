  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 85,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age and Gender",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being an 18-year-old male is concerning as this age group often has a higher rate of reoffending due to factors like impulsivity, peer influence, and limited life experience."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Criminal History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A history of 10 arrests with a conviction indicates a pattern of criminal behavior. This is a strong indicator for potential reoffending as it shows a lack of deterrence from previous encounters with the law."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past use of marijuana and cocaine suggests a potential risk factor, especially if there is ongoing substance abuse. However, without recent drug use or signs of addiction, this risk may be mitigated to some extent."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment Status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Holding only 1 job during the year could indicate instability in employment, which can contribute to financial stress and potentially lead to criminal activity. However, this factor alone is not a strong predictor."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education Level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate but no college enrollment may limit future opportunities for the individual. While education can be a protective factor against crime, it's hard to weigh this heavily without more context on their plans and aspirations."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents is generally considered a positive family background. This factor alone does not carry significant weight, but the influence of other risk factors could be mitigated by supportive parental figures."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed in the past month is encouraging and may indicate good mental health. However, it's important to consider that depression is only one aspect of mental well-being, and other potential issues should be assessed for a comprehensive understanding."
