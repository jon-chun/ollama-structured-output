  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age and Gender",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The individual is an 18-year-old male. Younger people tend to have higher rates of reoffending due to their impulsivity, lack of life experience, and a sense of invincibility."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Criminal History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "With 10 arrests and a conviction, the individual has an extensive criminal history. Previous convictions are often strong predictors of future reoffending behavior as it suggests that previous interventions or consequences have not deterred them from offending again."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The individual has a GED certificate but is not currently enrolled in any educational program. Education can provide individuals with alternatives to crime and reduce the likelihood of reoffending by giving them skills, knowledge, and opportunities for legitimate employment."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The individual has held 1 job during the year. While having a stable job can reduce the risk of reoffending by providing structure, income, and a sense of purpose, it is not considered a strong predictor in this case as it's unclear if the job provides sufficient financial stability or if the individual is actively engaged."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The person has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use can be a factor in reoffending as it may lead to involvement with criminal networks or impair judgment, increasing the likelihood of committing crimes."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The individual has not felt depressed over the past month. Depression and other mental health issues can increase the risk of reoffending as they may affect an individual's ability to control their impulses, make rational decisions, or cope with stress."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person lived in a nuclear family household and considers that God has something to do with his life. While growing up in a stable family environment can reduce the risk of reoffending, it's difficult to determine how much this factor influences an individual's behavior without more information on their current support network."
