    {
      "factor": "number of arrests",

      "factor": "conviction status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Convicted indicates that the individual has shown a disregard for the law, but may not necessarily be prone to recidivism without additional risk factors."

    {
      "factor": "family stability in childhood",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an unstable household with both biological parents living together can indicate difficulties in family relationships and coping mechanisms that could contribute to criminal behavior."

    {
      "factor": "employment status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Not holding a job indicates potential issues with motivation, responsibility, or stability which can be risk factors for recidivism."

      "factor": "history of drug use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "History of substance abuse is a significant risk factor as it often correlates with criminal behavior and the likelihood of returning to such behavior in the future."

      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed indicates that mental health issues are not currently being actively represented by this individual, though does not rule out the potential for past or future issues with mental health affecting criminal activity."

      "factor": "education level",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Limited education may indicate lower socio-economic status and less access to resources that could help mitigate the likelihood of recidivism."
