    {
      "factor": "number_of_arrests",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been arrested multiple times increases the likelihood of being rearrested. In this case, he has been arrested 10 times."
    },
    {
      "factor": "has_conviction_record",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A conviction record is a strong indicator of future criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "educational_attainment",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED certificate may indicate limited opportunities for education or employment, potentially contributing to further involvement in crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment_history",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Only holding one job during the year suggests instability which could be related to other life circumstances. However, this factor is less directly linked to criminal behavior compared to others listed here."
    },
    {
      "factor": "drug_use history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use can be a gateway to more serious substance abuse or indicate underlying issues that may contribute to crime."

    {
      "factor": "mental_health",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Feeling depressed recently is not a factor listed as indicating an increased likelihood of rearrest in the context given. While it could have implications for mental health treatment and overall well-being, there is less direct correlation with criminal behavior than other factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family_upbringing",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in a household of size 4 may indicate family dynamics that are not conducive to long-term stability or positive influence. However, the impact on this individual's likelihood of being rearrested is less direct than other factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "socio-economic-status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person is currently living alone and does not have a spouse, indicating they may be more independent but lack social support. While this could potentially mitigate some risks, the impact on rearrest likelihood in relation to others listed here seems less direct."
    },
    {
      "factor": "cultural_belief",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person attributes his life circumstances to a higher power may suggest a level of spirituality or resilience that counteracts negative influences. The strength of this factor as an independent risk is not clearly defined in the context provided."
