      {
        "factor": "Number of arrests",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "High number of arrests indicates a history of involvement in criminal activity, which is a strong predictor of future rearrest."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Age at first conviction",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The age at first conviction may not be directly relevant to the likelihood of rearrest, as this person's earliest convictions occurred when he was 18 or younger. However, it is still worth noting."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Employment and education",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Lack of employment and education may indicate a lack of opportunities for the individual to turn their life around, which could contribute to a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, this factor is not as strong as others."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Substance use",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "A history of substance use can be a risk factor for criminal activity, but the four-year time frame and lack of current use may mitigate this risk. However, it is still worth noting."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Family background",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Living with both biological parents at a young age suggests a relatively stable home environment, which could have a positive impact on the individual's life trajectory."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Religious beliefs",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Believing that God is involved in personal events may not directly impact the likelihood of rearrest. However, it may contribute to a sense of hope or resilience, which could be beneficial."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Depression and mental health",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Lack of depression over the past month suggests that the individual is currently in a relatively stable emotional state. However, this factor may not be directly relevant to the likelihood of rearrest."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Height and weight",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Physical characteristics have little to no bearing on an individual's likelihood of involvement in criminal activity or rearrest."
