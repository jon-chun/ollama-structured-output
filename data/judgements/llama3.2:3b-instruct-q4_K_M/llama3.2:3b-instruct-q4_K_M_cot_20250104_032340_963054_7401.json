      {
        "factor": "Number of arrests",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "High number of arrests at a young age indicates potential for future criminal behavior."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Previous convictions",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Multiple convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that may lead to further criminal activity, but the lack of imprisonment could indicate more lenient treatment or an attempt to turn one's life around."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Length of incarceration",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "No information is provided about length of incarceration, which may suggest that the individual has not spent extensive time behind bars. This lack of information reduces its predictive power in this case."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Employment history",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Only holding one job during a year suggests limited employment experience and potential instability in life circumstances, which may contribute to criminal activity. However, lack of information about job type or duration makes it harder to fully assess the impact."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Drug use history",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Past drug use could indicate substance abuse issues and potential for involvement in criminal activities related to drug trade. Marijuana and cocaine are often associated with higher risks of criminal behavior, especially when combined."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Mental health status",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "No depression over the past month suggests relatively stable mental health. However, lack of information about previous mental health issues or coping mechanisms makes it harder to fully assess its impact on future criminal behavior."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Family background",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Growing up in a household with both biological parents may suggest better family support and structure. However, living in an urban area could also contribute to higher crime rates and exposure to criminal activity."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Religious affiliation",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Identifying oneself as Christian suggests potential for religious influence on one's life. However, without specific information about how this faith is applied or affects behavior, its impact in predicting future criminal activity remains unclear."
