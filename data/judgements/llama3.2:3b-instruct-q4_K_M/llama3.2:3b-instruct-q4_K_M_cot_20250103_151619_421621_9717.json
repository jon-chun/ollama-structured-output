    {
      "factor": "Age at first arrest (18)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While early arrests can be a concern, it's not uncommon for young individuals to have more frequent interactions with law enforcement due to their age and inexperience."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of convictions (10)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A high number of convictions suggests a pattern of behavior that may indicate a higher likelihood of future reoffending."

    {
      "factor": "Education level (GED)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While lack of education can be a factor, it's not the most significant predictor in this case. The individual has shown the ability to find employment and maintain basic stability despite limited formal education."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment history (1 job)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "A short employment history may indicate instability or difficulties with maintaining employment, but it's not a strong predictor on its own."
    },
    {
      "factor": "History of substance use (past 4 years)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past substance use can be a risk factor for future problems, but the individual has demonstrated relatively stable behavior over the past year by stating they have not felt depressed."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family situation at age 18 (lived with both parents)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in a stable household can help mitigate some of the risks associated with early life, but it's not enough to completely offset other risk factors."
