    {
      "factor": "number_of_arrests",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "10 previous arrests are a strong indicator of a high risk of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age_of_termination",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "At 18 years old, the individual is in an age group where most criminal careers begin and end. However, this factor is only medium weight because many young people are involved in crime during this period."
    },
    {
      "factor": "weight_and_height",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Height and weight do not appear to be related to rearrest statistics in criminal justice research. This factor is low weight because it does not seem relevant to the likelihood of a person being rearrested within 3 years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education_level",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "A GED certificate indicates limited education, which can be associated with a higher risk of criminal behavior. However, this factor is only medium weight because many people with lower levels of education are not involved in crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment_history",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having held only 1 job during the year does not appear to be related to rearrest statistics in criminal justice research. This factor is low weight because it does not seem relevant to the likelihood of a person being rearrested within 3 years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "drug_use_history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past use of marijuana and cocaine suggests that this individual may be more likely to engage in substance-related criminal behavior. However, this factor is only medium weight because many people who use drugs do not become involved in crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "mental_health",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed over the past month indicates a low risk of mental health issues contributing to rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family_structure",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents and a household size of 4 may have some effect on behavior. However, this factor is only medium weight because many people from similar backgrounds are not involved in crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "spiritual_beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Considering that God has something to do with what happens to him personally does not appear to be related to rearrest statistics in criminal justice research. This factor is low weight because it does not seem relevant to the likelihood of a person being rearrested within 3 years."
