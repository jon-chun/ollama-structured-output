      "reasoning": "Having been convicted multiple times may indicate a lack of success in rehabilitation or treatment programs, but it's not as strong an indicator as the arrest history."

      "factor": "Employment History",

      "reasoning": "Not having a job could indicate difficulties with employment or stability, but it's not as strong of an indicator as the arrest history and conviction record."

      "factor": "Drug Use History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Using drugs in the past four years suggests ongoing struggles with substance abuse, which could contribute to a higher likelihood of rearrest if not addressed properly."

      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents may have provided some level of stability, but it's not as strong an indicator as the individual's personal choices and behaviors."

      "factor": "Religious Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The belief that God has something to do with what happens personally may provide a sense of control or purpose, but it doesn't directly influence the likelihood of rearrest in this case."
