    {
      "factor": "Age (18)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Younger individuals tend to have less life experience, which may contribute to a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, this factor is not strongly correlated with rearrest rates."

    {
      "factor": "Number of arrests (10)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A history of multiple arrests suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to future involvement in criminal activity."

      "factor": "Conviction",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being convicted can be an indicator of poor decision-making and a lack of self-control, but it does not necessarily predict rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Physical characteristics (6 ft 1 in, 195 lbs)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Physical attributes do not have a strong correlation with criminal behavior or likelihood of rearrest."

      "factor": "Employment stability (held one job in the year)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Unstable employment can be an indicator of poor life management skills, but it is not a strong predictor of rearrest."

    {
      "factor": "Substance use (used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "History of substance use can contribute to criminal behavior, particularly if it involves selling or using illegal substances."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed does not necessarily indicate a lack of underlying issues that could lead to rearrest."

      "factor": "Family background (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "A stable family environment can provide support and structure, but it is not a guarantee against criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing in a higher power may help individuals cope with stress and make better life decisions, but its impact on rearrest rates is unclear."
