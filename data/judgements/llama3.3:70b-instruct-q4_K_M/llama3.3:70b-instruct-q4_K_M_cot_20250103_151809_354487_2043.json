    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person is 18 years old, which may contribute to impulsivity but isn't a strong predictor on its own."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender and Race",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being male and identifying as White doesn't significantly increase the risk of rearrest by itself."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Criminal History (10 arrests, convicted)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that is likely to continue without intervention."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Physical Characteristics",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Height and weight do not directly influence the likelihood of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital Status and Living Situation",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Never being married and living alone could indicate a lack of stable relationships, potentially increasing the risk of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Limited educational attainment might restrict job opportunities, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment History (1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Unstable employment history could contribute to financial instability and increase the risk of criminal activity."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use, especially with substances like cocaine, is a strong predictor of future legal issues due to addiction and the need to fund drug habits."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health (not feeling depressed over the past month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The absence of recent depression does not significantly impact the risk of rearrest in this context."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living with both biological parents could have provided a stable upbringing, but its effect on future criminal behavior is complex and depends on other factors like parental influence and socioeconomic status."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing in God's influence does not directly correlate with the likelihood of rearrest; it might even serve as a protective factor if it promotes positive behaviors, but this is variable."
