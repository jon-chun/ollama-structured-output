  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 80,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Research suggests that recidivism rates tend to decrease with age, but at 18 years old, this individual is still in a high-risk age group for impulsive decisions."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender and Race",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Statistics show that males, particularly those identifying as White, have varying recidivism rates depending on numerous factors including socioeconomic status and prior offenses, but being male is generally associated with a higher risk of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of Previous Arrests",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been arrested 10 times significantly increases the likelihood of future arrests, indicating a pattern of behavior or involvement in activities that are risky or illegal."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Physical Characteristics",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Height and weight (6 feet 1 inch, 195 lbs) may influence interactions with law enforcement but are not strong predictors of recidivism on their own."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital Status and Living Situation",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Not being married and living alone can indicate a lack of stable social support networks, which might increase the risk of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education and Employment",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate is a positive factor, but not being enrolled in college and having held only one job in the past year could indicate instability or lack of engagement in productive activities, increasing the risk of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant predictor of future legal issues, as it can lead to impaired judgment, involvement with criminal elements, or direct legal consequences related to drug offenses."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health and Well-being",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed over the past month is positive; however, mental health can fluctuate, and a lack of current depression does not rule out future struggles or risky behaviors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background and Current Beliefs",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up with both biological parents in an urban setting could have varying impacts depending on the quality of the home environment. Believing that God has something to do with personal events might offer some moral guidance but is not a strong predictor either way without more context."
