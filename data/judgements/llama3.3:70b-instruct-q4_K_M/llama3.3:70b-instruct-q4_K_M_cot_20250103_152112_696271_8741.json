  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 80,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age (18-year-old male)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While young age can be a risk factor for recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of life experience, it is not as significant when considered in isolation from other factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Ethnicity (White)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Research does not strongly support ethnicity as a direct predictor of rearrest. Socioeconomic status and access to resources are more influential."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Arrest history (10 times arrested, convicted)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A significant number of prior arrests and convictions is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior. This history indicates a pattern of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Physical characteristics (6 feet 1 inch, 195 lbs)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Physical attributes are not typically considered reliable predictors of rearrest unless directly related to the ability to commit certain types of crimes."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital status (never married) and living situation (living alone)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lack of stable relationships and social support can increase the likelihood of recidivism, but this factor is not as strong when considered in isolation."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Limited education can be associated with fewer opportunities and higher recidivism rates. However, having a GED suggests some level of educational attainment."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment history (held 1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Unstable employment or lack of employment is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as it indicates potential financial instability and lack of structure."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Recent drug use is a strong predictor of rearrest, as substance abuse is often linked to criminal behavior and recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health (not feeling depressed over the past month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The absence of recent depression does not strongly predict future criminal behavior. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but this individual's current state does not indicate a risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family background (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Coming from a two-parent household is generally considered protective against delinquency and recidivism. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but family stability mitigates this risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs (believes God has something to do with what happens personally)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework that discourages criminal behavior, but their impact on recidivism is complex and influenced by many factors, including the individual's commitment to their faith and its teachings."
