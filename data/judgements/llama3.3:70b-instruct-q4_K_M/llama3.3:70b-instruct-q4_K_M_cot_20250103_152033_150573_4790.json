  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 80,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The individual is 18 years old. While young age can be a risk factor for rearrest, the impact diminishes as the individual gets older. However, at 18, this might still contribute slightly to impulsivity and lack of life experience."
    },
    {
      "factor": "gender",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being male is often associated with higher crime rates than being female, but this is a broad demographic factor and not as directly influential as behavioral factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "race",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The individual identifies as White. Race can intersect with socioeconomic status and systemic biases, but on its own, it's less of a direct predictor of rearrest compared to other factors like employment history or substance use."
    },
    {
      "factor": "height_and_weight",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Physical attributes such as height (6 feet 1 inch) and weight (195 lbs) are not typically strong predictors of criminal behavior or recidivism unless in specific contexts (e.g., certain types of violent crime), which is not indicated here."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital_status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Never being married could imply a lack of stable relationships, which can be a protective factor against recidivism. However, this is more about the absence of a potential stabilizing influence rather than a direct risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "living_situation",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone might indicate a lack of social support or supervision, which could increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors leading to rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited educational attainment, which can impact job prospects and stability. This is a moderate risk factor because employment and education are strongly linked to recidivism rates."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment_history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Holding only one job during the year indicates instability in employment, which is a strong predictor of recidivism. Stable employment is often seen as a key factor in rehabilitation and reducing the likelihood of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "substance_use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine within the last four years is a significant risk factor for rearrest, as substance abuse is closely linked with criminal behavior and recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "mental_health",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests that, at least currently, mental health issues are not contributing to the individual's risk of rearrest. However, this does not account for potential undiagnosed issues or future mental health challenges."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family_background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Living with both biological parents in an urban area at a young age could have various impacts, but without more specific information about the home environment (e.g., parental substance use, criminal history), it's difficult to weigh this as a significant risk factor."
    },
    {
      "factor": "religious_beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing that God has something to do with personal events might provide a sense of purpose or moral framework for some individuals, potentially reducing the likelihood of recidivism. However, the impact of religious beliefs on behavior can vary widely among individuals."
