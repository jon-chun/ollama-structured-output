  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 80,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "18-year-old individuals can be considered young adults; while age is a factor in criminal behavior, it's not as significant compared to other factors like prior arrests and convictions."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of Prior Arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A high number of prior arrests significantly increases the likelihood of future offenses, indicating a pattern of behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Prior Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been convicted in the past is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior, suggesting that the individual has already been through the legal system and may not have been deterred by it."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While having a GED indicates some level of educational attainment, not being enrolled in college might limit future opportunities, potentially increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to lack of stable, fulfilling alternatives."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment (1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Unstable employment or a lack of steady income can contribute to financial instability, which might increase the temptation to engage in illegal activities for financial gain."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use (marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Substance use is often linked with criminal behavior, either as a direct cause (e.g., drug-related crimes) or an indirect factor (e.g., impairment leading to poor decision-making)."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital Status (never married) and Living Situation (alone)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "These factors can indicate a lack of strong social bonds, which are important for rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. However, their impact can vary widely among individuals."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Depression (not feeling depressed over the past month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The absence of recent depression might be seen as a positive factor in reducing the likelihood of engaging in self-destructive or risky behaviors associated with mental health issues, but its impact on recidivism is complex and can depend on many factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background (lived with both biological parents)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Coming from a stable family background could be considered a protective factor against future criminal behavior, though its effect compared to other risk factors might be minimal in this case."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing that God has something to do with personal happenings might provide a moral framework that could potentially reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior, but its impact is highly individual and can vary greatly."
