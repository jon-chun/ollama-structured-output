    {
      "factor": "Multiple previous arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Research suggests that individuals with a history of frequent arrests are more likely to be rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Conviction history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been convicted in the past indicates a higher likelihood of future legal issues."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While drug use can contribute to illegal activities, the impact varies widely among individuals."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Limited education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lower educational attainment can limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Unstable employment (held only 1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Job instability can contribute to financial stress, potentially leading to illegal activities as a means to earn money."

      "factor": "Young age (18 years old)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Youth can be a risk factor due to impulsivity and peer influences, but the individual's response to these factors can vary."
