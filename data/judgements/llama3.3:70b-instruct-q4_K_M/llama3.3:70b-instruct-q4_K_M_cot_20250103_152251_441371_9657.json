  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 80,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being 18 years old is not in itself a strong predictor for recidivism; however, it's a stage where life choices significantly impact future outcomes."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender and Race",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Statistical data may show varying rates of recidivism among different genders and races, but this is not a direct or strong predictor for an individual case."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of Previous Arrests",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Ten previous arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that suggests a higher likelihood of future legal issues."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Conviction History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been convicted in the past increases the likelihood of future offenses, as it may indicate unresolved issues or a lack of deterrent effect from previous legal consequences."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Physical Characteristics",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Height and weight are not typically strong predictors of recidivism unless directly related to the commission of crimes (e.g., physical intimidation), which is not indicated here."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital Status and Living Situation",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Not being married and living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism, but its impact varies widely among individuals."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Educational Background",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate is a positive factor, indicating some level of educational attainment, but not being enrolled in college may limit future opportunities and increase the risk of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Holding only one job in the past year may indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism due to financial stress and lack of structure."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use, especially with substances like cocaine, is a significant predictor of future legal issues, as it can lead to criminal activity to support the habit or impair judgment leading to illegal actions."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed in the past month is positive, but mental health can fluctuate, and this single data point does not strongly predict future behavior related to recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living with both biological parents at a young age in an urban setting could have varying impacts; stable family support is generally positive, but urban environments may expose individuals to higher crime rates and social influences that increase recidivism risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing that God has something to do with personal happenings might provide a moral framework, but its direct impact on recidivism is variable and depends on how these beliefs influence behavior and decision-making."
