    {
      "factor": "Multiple previous arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",

      "factor": "Conviction history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been convicted in the past increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior."

      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Substance abuse is linked to higher rates of recidivism, but the impact can vary widely among individuals."

      "factor": "Limited employment history (1 job in a year)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities."

      "factor": "Lack of higher education (only a GED certificate)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While education is a factor in recidivism, its impact compared to other factors like employment history and substance abuse may be less direct."

      "factor": "Never been married and living alone",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Marital status and living situation can influence behavior, but their predictive power in this case is considered lower than other factors like arrest history and drug use."

    {
      "factor": "Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While demographic factors can have broad statistical correlations with crime rates, they are not as directly predictive of individual behavior as specific actions and life circumstances."

      "factor": "Belief in a higher power's influence on personal life",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Spiritual beliefs can impact an individual's worldview and decision-making but are less directly correlated with recidivism rates compared to behavioral factors like drug use and employment history."
