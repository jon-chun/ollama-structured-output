  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being 18 years old is a relatively neutral factor for recidivism as it's the beginning of adulthood and doesn't directly predict future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Race",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Identifying as White does not significantly impact the likelihood of rearrest since race alone is not a strong predictor of criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of Previous Arrests",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been arrested 10 times indicates a pattern of behavior that suggests a higher likelihood of future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Conviction History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A history of convictions can indicate a lack of deterrent effect from previous legal consequences, suggesting a higher risk of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Physical Characteristics (Height and Weight)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While physical characteristics might influence interactions with law enforcement or peers, they are not strong predictors of recidivism on their own."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital Status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Never having been married can indicate a lack of stable relationships, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors, but its impact is moderate compared to other factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living Situation",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone could imply a lack of social support or supervision that might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Educational Background (GED and No College Enrollment)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED and not being enrolled in college may limit job opportunities, potentially increasing the risk of recidivism due to economic instability or lack of engagement in productive activities."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Holding only one job during the year could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a significant predictor of recidivism due to potential financial stress and lack of structure."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug Use History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine can be associated with higher risk behaviors and potentially with the commission of crimes to support drug habits, indicating a higher likelihood of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health (No Depression in the Past Month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed recently is a positive indicator but does not significantly reduce the risk of recidivism when considered against other factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background and Upbringing",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Living with both biological parents in an urban area at a young age could have varying impacts, but given the presence of other strong predictors, its influence is considered low in this case."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing that God has something to do with personal happenings may provide a moral framework but does not strongly predict recidivism when compared to behavioral and socio-economic factors."
