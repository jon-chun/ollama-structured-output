  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 85,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Multiple past arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Research has shown that individuals with a history of multiple arrests are more likely to be rearrested in the future."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While past drug use can increase the likelihood of recidivism, it's not as strong a predictor for this individual given other factors like age and criminal history."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Limited education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Education level can impact employment opportunities and stability, which are factors in recidivism. However, the impact may vary based on individual circumstances and other support systems."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Unstable employment (held only 1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Employment instability is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to financial stress and increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Young age (18 years old)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Younger individuals, especially males, are statistically more likely to be involved in criminal activity. However, this risk typically decreases with age as individuals mature."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living alone",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While living situation can impact support systems and stability, for an 18-year-old, living alone may not significantly increase the risk of rearrest compared to other factors like employment and past criminal history."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Conviction history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A history of convictions is a strong predictor of future arrests as it indicates both a propensity for criminal behavior and familiarity with the criminal justice system."
    },
    {
      "factor": "No recent feelings of depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The absence of recent depressive feelings might slightly reduce the risk, but mental health can fluctuate, and this factor alone does not strongly predict recidivism in this context."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Belief in God's influence on personal life",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While spiritual beliefs can provide a sense of purpose or moral framework, their direct impact on recidivism is less clear and likely varies greatly among individuals."
