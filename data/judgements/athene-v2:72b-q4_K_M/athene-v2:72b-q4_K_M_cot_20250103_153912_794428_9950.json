  "prediction": "YES",

  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age and Gender (18-year-old male)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Young adult males, especially those under the age of 25, are statistically more likely to be involved in criminal behavior and have higher recidivism rates."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of prior arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A high number of prior arrests is a strong predictor of future reoffending, as it indicates a pattern of criminal behavior and potential lack of deterrence from legal consequences."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living situation (living alone)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone can reduce social support networks that might otherwise help prevent reoffense. However, this is less impactful than other factors like prior arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education level (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lower educational attainment and lack of current enrollment can limit job opportunities and stability, which are protective factors against reoffense. However, having a GED is better than no high school diploma."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment (1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having some form of employment can provide structure and income, which are positive factors. However, limited work history may indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Substance use, especially of illegal drugs, is a significant risk factor for reoffending. It can impair judgment and decision-making and may be associated with criminal activities to support drug habits."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health (not feeling depressed over the past month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While mental health issues like depression can increase the risk of reoffense, not feeling depressed is a positive factor. However, this alone does not outweigh other high-risk factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family background (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up with both biological parents can provide stability and support, which is generally positive. However, the urban environment may expose individuals to more risk factors such as higher crime rates."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs (considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and social support, which may reduce the likelihood of reoffense. However, this factor is less predictive compared to others like prior arrests and substance use."
