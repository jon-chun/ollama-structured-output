  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 75,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age (18 years old)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens and early twenties, are statistically at higher risk for recidivism due to factors like impulsivity and less developed decision-making skills."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender (male)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Men have historically higher rates of rearrest compared to women. However, this is a demographic factor and should be considered alongside other more specific risk factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Race (White)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While racial disparities exist in the criminal justice system, race itself is not a strong predictor of individual behavior. It's important to consider structural and systemic factors but they are less predictive at an individual level."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of prior arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A high number of prior arrests is one of the strongest predictors of future rearrest. It suggests a pattern of behavior that may be difficult to change without significant intervention."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living situation (living alone, never married)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone and lack of social support can increase the risk of reoffending. Social bonds and relationships often provide stability and positive influences that help prevent recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED is better than no high school diploma, but lack of higher education can limit job opportunities and social mobility, which are protective factors against recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment (held 1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Stable employment is a significant protective factor. Holding only one job in a year suggests some stability but may not be enough to provide long-term security and structure."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Substance use, especially of harder drugs like cocaine, is strongly associated with an increased risk of reoffending. It can impair judgment and lead to risky behaviors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health (not feeling depressed over the past month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of current depression is a positive sign, but mental health can fluctuate. It's a lower risk factor compared to others like substance use and prior arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family background (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a stable family environment during childhood is generally positive, but the current living situation and other risk factors may outweigh this protective factor. Urban areas can also have higher exposure to crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs (considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, which may be protective. However, this is a relatively weak predictor compared to more concrete factors like prior arrests and substance use."
