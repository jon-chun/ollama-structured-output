  "prediction": "YES",

  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "10 arrests and conviction history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A high number of prior arrests, especially coupled with a conviction, is strongly associated with a higher likelihood of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Substance abuse can be a significant factor in criminal behavior. While not as high as the arrest history, it still increases the risk of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living alone and never been married",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lack of social support and stable relationships can contribute to higher recidivism rates. Living alone may indicate a lack of supportive social networks."
    },
    {
      "factor": "GED certificate, not enrolled in college",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While having only a GED and no further education might limit job opportunities, it is less predictive of rearrest compared to other factors like arrest history or substance use."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Held 1 job during the year",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Employment stability can be a protective factor against recidivism. Holding only one job in a year might indicate instability, which is a moderate risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "No feelings of depression over the past month",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of current depression is generally positive but does not strongly predict rearrest on its own."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Belief that God has something to do with personal outcomes",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious beliefs can provide support, but this factor alone is not a strong predictor of rearrest. It could be seen as neutral or slightly protective."
    },
    {
      "factor": "18 years old, male, White",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Young age and gender are known risk factors for criminal behavior and recidivism. However, race is a complex factor that can interact with other social determinants but should not be overemphasized without context."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Lived with both biological parents in an urban area",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Stable family background during early years is generally positive. Urban living alone does not strongly predict rearrest but can contribute to environmental factors that influence behavior."
