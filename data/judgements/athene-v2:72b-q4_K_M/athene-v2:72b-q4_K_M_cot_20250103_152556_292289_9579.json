  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 75,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age and Gender (18-year-old male)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Young males are statistically at a higher risk for recidivism due to the combination of age and gender, often associated with higher rates of involvement in criminal activity."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of prior arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A high number of prior arrests is one of the strongest predictors of rearrest. This individual's history suggests a pattern of behavior that may continue."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living situation (living alone)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone can indicate a lack of social support, which is often crucial for rehabilitation and avoiding reoffending. However, this is less critical than the number of prior arrests or substance use."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education level (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED and not being further educated can limit job opportunities and social mobility, which are important for reducing recidivism. However, having obtained a GED suggests some commitment to education."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment status (1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Stable employment is associated with lower recidivism rates. Holding only one job might indicate instability or difficulty in maintaining employment, but it's not as strong a predictor as prior arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Drug use, especially of substances like cocaine, is strongly associated with higher rates of reoffending. It can impair judgment and lead to riskier behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health (not feeling depressed over the past month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of current depression is a positive factor, but it does not outweigh other stronger predictors like substance use or prior arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family background (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up with both parents can provide some stability and social support, which is generally positive. However, the urban environment might expose him to higher crime rates, balancing this factor."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs (considers God has something to do with what happens)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While religious beliefs can provide a moral framework and social support, they are not as strong predictors of recidivism compared to other factors like substance use or prior arrests."
