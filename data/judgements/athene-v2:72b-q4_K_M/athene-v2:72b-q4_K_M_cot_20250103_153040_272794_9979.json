  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 75,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "10 prior arrests and convicted",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Multiple prior arrests, especially when leading to convictions, indicate a pattern of criminal behavior that is strongly predictive of future offenses."
    },
    {
      "factor": "18-year-old male",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Young age, particularly in males, is associated with higher rates of recidivism due to factors like immaturity and the likelihood of being influenced by peer pressure."
    },
    {
      "factor": "White ethnicity",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While some studies suggest differences in rearrest rates across ethnicities, this factor is less predictive compared to criminal history or socioeconomic status. It's important to avoid overemphasizing demographic factors without strong evidence."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living alone and never married",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lack of social support and stability from a partner can increase the likelihood of reoffending, as these relationships often provide emotional and practical support that can deter criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "GED certificate, not enrolled in college",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED and no higher education may limit job opportunities and social mobility, which are important factors in reducing the likelihood of reoffending. However, having completed a GED is better than no educational attainment at all."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Held 1 job during the year",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Limited employment history suggests instability and potential difficulties in maintaining consistent work, which can increase the risk of rearrest. Employment stability is often a protective factor against recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Substance abuse is strongly correlated with criminal behavior and recidivism. The use of both marijuana and cocaine suggests ongoing issues that may contribute to future legal problems."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Not feeling depressed over the past month",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While mental health issues can be a risk factor for reoffending, the absence of depression in this case is not as strong a predictor. However, it's worth noting that substance use can mask underlying mental health issues."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Lived with both biological parents in an urban area",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "A stable family environment during early years can be protective, but the current urban setting and other risk factors may outweigh this positive influence. The urban context might also imply exposure to more opportunities for criminal activity."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Belief that God has something to do with personal outcomes",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, which may reduce the likelihood of reoffending. However, this factor is less predictive compared to more direct behavioral and environmental factors."
