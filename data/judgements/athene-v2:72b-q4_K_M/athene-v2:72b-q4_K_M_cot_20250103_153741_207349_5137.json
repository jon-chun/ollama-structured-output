  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 75,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age (18 years old)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Young age is associated with higher risk-taking behaviors and less established social stability, which can contribute to recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender (male)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Males are statistically more likely to be rearrested compared to females, but this factor alone is not a strong predictor without other context."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Race (White)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While some studies show variations in recidivism rates by race, it's important to consider that these differences are often influenced by systemic factors rather than being a direct risk factor. In this case, without more context about social and economic conditions, the impact is considered low."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A higher number of previous arrests strongly correlates with an increased likelihood of rearrest. This suggests a pattern of criminal behavior that may be difficult to break."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Conviction history (convicted)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having been convicted indicates a more serious involvement in the justice system, which is a moderate risk factor for rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living situation (living alone)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone may indicate less social support and stability, which can contribute to recidivism. However, it's not as strong a predictor as the number of arrests or drug use."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education level (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lower educational attainment and lack of current enrollment can limit job opportunities and social mobility, which are important for reducing recidivism risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment history (1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While having only one job in a year might suggest limited employment stability, it is less predictive than factors like arrest history or drug use."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Substance use, especially of illegal drugs, is strongly associated with an increased risk of rearrest. It can lead to further criminal behavior and poor decision-making."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health (not feeling depressed over the past month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of current depression is a positive factor, but it does not strongly predict against rearrest. Mental health can fluctuate, and other factors may be more influential."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Upbringing (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "A stable upbringing is generally positive, but the urban environment and current adult circumstances are more relevant. This factor has a lower weight given the other strong predictors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs (believes God has an impact on personal life)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While religious belief can provide social support and moral guidance, it is not a strong predictor of recidivism when compared to factors like arrest history or drug use."
