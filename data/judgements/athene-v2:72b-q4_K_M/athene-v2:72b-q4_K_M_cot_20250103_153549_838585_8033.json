  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 75,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age (18 years old)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Young age is often associated with a higher risk of reoffending, as individuals in this demographic are still developing judgment and decision-making skills."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender (male)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Males have historically shown higher rates of recidivism compared to females."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Race (White)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While race can be a factor in some studies, it is less predictive when considered alongside other stronger factors like criminal history and socioeconomic status. However, systemic issues may still influence outcomes."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Number of arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A high number of prior arrests indicates a pattern of involvement with the legal system, which is strongly associated with a higher risk of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Convicted in the past",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having been convicted suggests a level of criminal activity that has been substantiated by the justice system, increasing the likelihood of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living alone and never married",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lack of social support and stability can contribute to higher recidivism rates. Living alone may indicate fewer positive social ties."
    },
    {
      "factor": "GED certificate, not enrolled in college",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Educational attainment is a mixed factor; having a GED is positive but not pursuing further education can limit job opportunities and stability."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Held 1 job during the year",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Limited employment history suggests instability and possibly difficulty maintaining steady work, which can increase the risk of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Substance use is a significant predictor of recidivism, as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Not feeling depressed over the past month",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of current depression is generally positive, but mental health is just one aspect. The absence of depression does not negate other risk factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Stable family structure during childhood can be positive, but the current living situation and other factors are more influential. Urban areas may have higher exposure to crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Belief that God has something to do with personal outcomes",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious beliefs can provide a support system, but this factor alone is not strongly predictive of recidivism. It could indicate a potential for positive social influence."
