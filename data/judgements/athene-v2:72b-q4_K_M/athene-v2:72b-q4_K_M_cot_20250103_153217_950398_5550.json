  "prediction": "YES",

  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age (18 years old)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Young age is often associated with a higher risk of recidivism, as individuals in this demographic are still developing judgment and decision-making skills. However, it's not the strongest predictor."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender (male) and Race (White)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Males have historically higher rates of recidivism compared to females. While race can be a factor in systemic issues, the data provided does not suggest that being White is particularly high risk for rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Arrest history (10 arrests and convicted)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A significant criminal history, especially with convictions, is a strong predictor of future rearrest. This factor heavily influences the prediction."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living situation (living alone, never married)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lack of social support and stable relationships can increase the likelihood of reoffending. Living alone may indicate a lack of positive social ties that could help prevent rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED and not being in further education can limit job opportunities and stability, which are protective factors against recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment (1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While having employment is generally positive, holding only one job may indicate limited work experience or instability. However, it's not as strong a predictor as other factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Substance use is strongly associated with increased risk of rearrest, particularly if it involves illegal drugs like marijuana and cocaine. This factor significantly influences the prediction."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health (not feeling depressed over the past month)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of current depression is a positive sign, but mental health can fluctuate. It's less predictive compared to substance use and criminal history."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family background (lived with both biological parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a stable family background is generally positive, though living in an urban area can expose individuals to more risk factors. However, this factor is less influential given the other stronger predictors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs (considers God has something to do with what happens)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious beliefs may provide some level of moral guidance and support, but they are not strong predictors of rearrest when compared to criminal history and substance use."
