  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 75,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age (18 years old)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Younger individuals, especially those in late adolescence, are at a higher risk of reoffending due to ongoing development and less established social stability."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Gender (male)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Males have historically shown higher rates of rearrest compared to females, though this factor is not as strong as others like criminal history or substance use."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Race (White)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While race can be a factor in systemic issues affecting arrest rates, it does not strongly predict individual rearrest risk when other factors are considered."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Arrest history (10 times, convicted)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A significant criminal history is one of the strongest predictors of future rearrest. Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of behavior that is likely to continue."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living situation (living alone)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone can reduce social support, which is important for rehabilitation and avoiding reoffending. However, this factor is less predictive than criminal history or substance use."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education (GED certificate, not in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lower educational attainment and lack of ongoing education can limit job opportunities and social mobility, which are important for reducing recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment (1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having at least one job suggests some level of employment stability, but it is not a strong protective factor if other risk factors are present."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Drug use, especially of substances like cocaine, is strongly associated with higher rates of reoffending due to the potential for dependency and related criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health (not depressed)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of current depression can be a positive factor, but it does not outweigh other stronger risk factors like substance use or criminal history."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family background (lived with both parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "A stable family environment during childhood is generally protective, but the impact diminishes over time and is less significant compared to current factors like substance use and criminal history."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs (believes God has an influence on personal life)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While religious belief can provide some level of moral guidance, it is not a strong predictor of rearrest when compared to more direct risk factors like substance use and criminal history."
