  "prediction": "YES",
  "confidence": 75,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Number of prior arrests (10 times)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A high number of prior arrests is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior, indicating a pattern that may be difficult to break."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Age and gender (18-year-old male)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Young males are statistically at higher risk for reoffending due to factors like developmental stage, peer influence, and societal roles. However, age also means he is at the point where interventions might still have a significant impact."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Criminal history (has been convicted)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "A prior conviction suggests that the individual has already engaged in behavior serious enough to result in legal consequences, which increases the likelihood of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living situation (living alone, never married)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone and not having a stable social support system can increase the risk of reoffending due to lack of positive influences and accountability."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Educational background (GED certificate, not enrolled in college)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While holding a GED is positive, not being engaged in further education can limit future opportunities and social connections that might reduce the likelihood of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment history (1 job during the year)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Holding at least one job suggests some level of employment stability, which is generally positive. However, a single job in a year might not be sufficient to indicate long-term employment stability."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use (marijuana and cocaine)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Drug use is a significant risk factor for reoffending, as it can lead to impaired judgment, legal issues, and difficulty maintaining stable employment or relationships."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health (not feeling depressed recently)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of current depression is a positive sign, but mental health can fluctuate. It's less critical than other factors like substance use and criminal history."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family background (lived with both parents in an urban area)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "A stable family environment during childhood is generally positive, but the current living situation alone may not be enough to mitigate other risk factors. Urban areas can also present additional challenges."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Religious beliefs (considers God has a role in personal life)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While religious belief can provide a sense of structure and support, it is generally a less direct predictor of reoffending compared to factors like criminal history and substance use."
