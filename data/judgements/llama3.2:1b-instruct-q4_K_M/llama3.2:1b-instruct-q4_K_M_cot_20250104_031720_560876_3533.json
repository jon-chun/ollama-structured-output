      {
        "factor": "Age (18-25)",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "An individual in their early twenties is more likely to be arrested and rearrested within a shorter timeframe due to the stage of development, lack of life experience, and potential for impulsivity."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Conviction history",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "A history of convictions increases the likelihood of rearrest, as it suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to further charges or recidivism."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Weight (195 lbs)",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "While being overweight can be a concern for overall health and well-being, it is not directly correlated with an increased risk of rearrest in this context."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Height (6 feet 1 inch)",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Taller individuals may have a slightly higher likelihood of being arrested due to perceived intimidating physical presence, but correlation does not imply causation in this scenario."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Income level (not enrolled in college)",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Being unemployed or underemployed can contribute to a higher risk of rearrest due to lack of resources, social isolation, and limited access to education and job opportunities."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Education (GED certificate)",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate suggests some level of education, but it is not directly correlated with an increased risk of rearrest in this context."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Marital status (currently living alone)",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Being single or unmarried can increase the risk of rearrest due to lack of social support, family involvement, and potential for impulsivity."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Religion (consider God has something to do with what happens to him personally)",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "This factor is highly subjective and not directly correlated with an increased risk of rearrest in this context."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Lifestyle choices (used drugs for the past four years)",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Using illicit substances can increase the risk of rearrest due to potential health risks, impaired judgment, and increased likelihood of substance abuse treatment."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Mental health (no depression over the past month)",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed does not necessarily mean an individual is not at risk of rearrest; mental health can be influenced by various factors, including environment and life experiences."

      {
        "factor": "Biological characteristics (lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4)",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Growing up in a stable environment may reduce the risk of rearrest due to lack of environmental stressors and potential for emotional well-being."

      {
        "factor": "Age at entry into adulthood (lived with both biological parents)",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Being in a stable household environment as a child can increase the likelihood of better life outcomes and reduced risk of rearrest."
