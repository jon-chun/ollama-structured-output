  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age (18 years)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "At 18, the person is considered a young adult with potential for risk-taking behavior and criminal activity. However, his lack of education and job experience reduces the likelihood of future incarceration."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Conviction history (10 times)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While multiple convictions may be a concern, it is not as strong a predictor of rearrest in this case due to his relatively short time on record and lack of indication that he is prone to habitual criminal behavior."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Weight (195 lbs)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being overweight may be a concern for health, but it does not directly relate to the likelihood of rearrest within three years in this case."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Income (1 job and no education)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having only one job with no college education may indicate financial instability, but it does not directly relate to the likelihood of rearrest within three years in this case."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drugging habits (4 years)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's history of using drugs for four years may suggest a high risk of relapse, which could contribute to future rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "There is no indication that the person feels depressed over the past month, so this factor does not significantly influence his likelihood of being rearrested within three years in this case."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Living situation (lived with both biological parents and has a household of size 4)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having a stable home life may contribute to reduced stress and risk-taking behavior, which could help mitigate the likelihood of rearrest within three years in this case."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Moral character (consider God has something to do with what happens)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's strong faith may indicate a moral compass that could help him avoid risk-taking behavior and reduce the likelihood of rearrest within three years in this case."
