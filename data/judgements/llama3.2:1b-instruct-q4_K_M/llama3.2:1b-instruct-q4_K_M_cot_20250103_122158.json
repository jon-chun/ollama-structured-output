    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "As an 18-year-old male, he has already experienced multiple arrests and convictions, which may indicate a higher risk of future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "race",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While his identity as White is noted, there are no explicit details on whether this could be a 'high-risk' factor. However, the lack of concrete information makes it difficult to assess its weight."
    },
    {
      "factor": "gender",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "There's no context for the person's gender; therefore, we can't make an informed assessment about his likelihood of being rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age_of_consecutive_arrests",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "He has been arrested 10 times, which suggests that there may be a pattern to his arrests. However, this factor alone does not account for the person's future likelihood of being rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "conviction_history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "His previous convictions indicate a possible risk of future arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment_history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Although he has held only one job during the year, his lack of employment suggests that there may be underlying issues that could impact his future likelihood of being rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education_level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "His GED certificate and not-enrolled-in-college status suggest limited education and potentially fewer opportunities for professional advancement, which might influence his likelihood of being arrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital_status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "As a single individual with no spouse or dependents, he may have more freedom to engage in illicit activities without fear of repercussions."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family_structure",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "His biological parents' household size (4) and urban location might suggest that he has had access to support systems and potentially fewer opportunities for involvement with the law."
    },
    {
      "factor": "community_environment",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "He considers God's will in his personal life, which could indicate a certain level of spirituality or moral resolve, making it less likely that he would engage in illegal activities."
