    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "At age 18, he is considered an adult but still under juvenile justice system supervision. This suggests he may be more likely to reoffend."

      "factor": "race",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "As a White male, he may face less bias and stigma in the eyes of law enforcement compared to individuals from minority groups."

      "factor": "sexuality",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "His sexual orientation is not specified, but being a White man raises questions about his likelihood of reoffending due to societal expectations and biases."

    {
      "factor": "criminally_convicted_history",
