      "factor": "Racial Identity",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While not directly related to the prediction, considering his racial identity may help explain why he has had a higher arrest rate compared to others with similar socioeconomic profiles."

      "factor": "Previous Arrests and Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been arrested multiple times increases the likelihood of rearrest, as well as the potential for increased scrutiny from law enforcement."

      "factor": "Substance Use (marijuana/co cocaine) ",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Using drugs in the past four years increases the likelihood of rearrest due to increased impulsivity and decreased judgment."
