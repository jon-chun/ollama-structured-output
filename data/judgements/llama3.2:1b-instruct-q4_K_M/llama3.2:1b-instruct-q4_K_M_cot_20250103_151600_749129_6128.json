    {
      "factor": "conviction_count",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Multiple arrests and convictions may indicate a higher likelihood of rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family_status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone without a spouse or family may increase the risk of future re-arrest due to isolation."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education_level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED certificate and not being enrolled in college suggests limited economic and social opportunities, which could contribute to higher crime rates."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment_status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Holding only one job during the year may indicate financial instability or lack of career advancement, increasing the risk of re-arrest."

    {
      "factor": "substance_abuse",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Long-term use of marijuana and cocaine can lead to addiction and substance-related issues, potentially increasing future crime rates."

      "reasoning": "Being 18 years old does not necessarily imply a higher risk of re-arrest, as younger individuals may be less likely to repeat offenses."

      "factor": "depression",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Not feeling depressed over the past month could indicate mental health stability, reducing the likelihood of future re-arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family_structure",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 may suggest a stable family environment and reduced risk of crime."

    {
      "factor": "community_involvement",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Considering God's involvement does not directly relate to community involvement or crime rates, but it could be a proxy for other factors like economic stability or access to resources."
