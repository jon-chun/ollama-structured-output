    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Given that the person identifies himself as White and has a household of size 4 in an urban area, it is likely that he comes from a more stable family background which may contribute to his lower likelihood of being rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While the person has never felt depressed over the past month, this lack of mental health issues does not necessarily mean he will be less likely to be rearrested. However, his past history with drugs and potential genetic predispositions may still increase his risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's lack of education is a red flag for criminal behavior, but it does not directly impact his likelihood of being rearrested within 3 years. However, if he were to pursue higher education or vocational training, this could potentially decrease his risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's history of job changes may indicate a lack of stability in his life, which can increase the likelihood of him being rearrested. This factor is weighted as high because it directly correlates with factors such as employment status and job instability."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital Status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's unmarried status does not provide any clear indicators for his likelihood of being rearrested within 3 years. However, this may be worth considering in combination with other factors such as employment history and education."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's age is a factor that can impact his likelihood of being rearrested due to potential biological, genetic, or developmental factors. However, without more context, this factor should be weighted as high."

    {
      "factor": "GED Certificate",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate may indicate a lack of education and potentially lower socio-economic status, which can increase the likelihood of being rearrested. However, this factor is not directly correlated with his risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Age of Conviction",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The person's age of conviction may indicate a lack of maturity or impulsivity, which can increase the likelihood of him being rearrested. However, this factor is weighted as medium because it is not directly correlated with his risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Previous Arrest",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having been arrested 10 times does indicate a high level of criminal behavior and a strong likelihood of being rearrested. However, this factor should be weighted as low due to the lack of other risk factors."
