  "prediction": "NO",
  "confidence": 50,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "At an age of 18, the person is still a minor and has not yet reached legal adulthood, making it less likely that he will be rearrested. However, his past arrests could suggest some underlying issues."
    },
    {
      "factor": "race",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Given the person's racial identity as White, it may indicate a lack of systemic biases or discrimination against marginalized groups, which could contribute to reduced risk of arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "conviction history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Although he has been convicted multiple times, his past arrests and convictions are often not the primary reasons for his subsequent arrests. Instead, these may be indicative of underlying issues or patterns that could lead to future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family environment",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The fact that he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 and considers God's involvement suggests a potentially supportive family structure, which could contribute to reduced risk of arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "drug use",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Although he has used drugs in the past four years, it is unclear whether this contributes to any increased risk of future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having held only one job during the year may indicate that the person is still recovering from previous jobs and could be at a higher risk of future arrests due to lack of stability."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Given the person's lack of education, it is unclear whether he has received any training or support services that could help him navigate challenges and reduce his risk of arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Living alone may indicate a higher level of independence and potentially reduced social support, which could contribute to increased stress levels and, subsequently, an increased risk of future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "height",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being 6 feet 1 inch is not unusually tall for someone in his age group. It is unclear whether height has any bearing on the person's likelihood of being rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "weight",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Weight can be an indicator of overall health and fitness, which may impact the individual's ability to meet basic needs and engage in social activities. This could potentially contribute to increased stress levels and, subsequently, an increased risk of future arrests."
