  "prediction": "NO",
  "confidence": 10,
  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While being an 18-year-old male is a risk factor, his relatively low age and lack of any previous convictions may mitigate this. However, considering the past four years of substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) is a significant concern."
    },
    {
      "factor": "physical characteristics",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "His height (6 feet 1 inch), weight (195 lbs), and biological background (size 4 household with both parents) may contribute to his vulnerability. Additionally, living alone increases his risk of being arrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Although having a GED certificate indicates some level of education, it does not necessarily increase his likelihood of reoffending. Furthermore, he is not enrolled in college, which could indicate limited opportunities for employment and incarceration."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "His lack of a spouse may reduce the number of potential partners he has to reoffend with, but it does not eliminate this risk entirely."
    },
    {
      "factor": "job history and education level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having held only one job during the year indicates limited economic opportunities and a lack of stability in his life, making him more vulnerable to reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "substance abuse",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "His past use of marijuana and cocaine increases his risk of substance abuse, which may lead to further incarceration if he were to commit a new crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "He has reported not feeling depressed over the past month, but this does not eliminate his risk of reoffending. In fact, substance abuse is often linked to depression and anxiety."
    },
    {
      "factor": "hiding history",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "His living alone may increase the likelihood of being arrested if he were to commit a new crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "faith",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "He mentions that God has something to do with what happens to him personally, suggesting that his faith may play a role in his decision-making process."
