    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "He is an 18-year-old male who has already been arrested 10 times, which suggests a higher risk of rearrest"
    },
    {
      "factor": "sex",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "As a White male, he may be considered a vulnerable group in the eyes of law enforcement and judges, increasing his likelihood of rearrest"
    },
    {
      "factor": "race",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that his racial identity as White may make him more susceptible to arrest due to historical biases and discriminatory practices"
    },
    {
      "factor": "family circumstances",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area, suggests a high level of stability and support which could reduce his likelihood of rearrest"

    {
      "factor": "marital status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "He is single and has never been married, which may indicate less opportunity for social support or community resources that could help him avoid arrest"

      "factor": "occupation",

    {
      "factor": "education level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not having a GED certificate or enrolled in college indicates a possible lack of access to education and training programs which could help him rehabilitate"

    {
      "factor": "drug use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Although he has not felt depressed over the past month, his history with drugs (marijuana and cocaine) may suggest some level of vulnerability to substance abuse or addiction"

      "factor": "employment status",

      "factor": "housing situation",
      "weight": "medium",

      "factor": " religiosity",
