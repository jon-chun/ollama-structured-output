  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "At the age of 18, having been arrested 10 times already is a significant risk factor"
    },
    {
      "factor": "sex",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "As an 18-year-old male, being White may be considered a 'high-risk' factor due to societal biases and prejudices against minority groups"
    },
    {
      "factor": "crime history",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While having been convicted of crimes before is a significant risk factor, the person has also shown no symptoms of depression, which could mitigate this risk"
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having held only one job in the past year may indicate financial instability or lack of stability, but it's not necessarily a direct predictor of rearrest within three years"
    },
    {
      "factor": "family situation",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4 and considering God has something to do with what happens to him personally may suggest a nurturing environment that could reduce the risk of future arrests"
    },
    {
      "factor": "education level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate is not directly predictive, but it indicates limited access to resources or education, which might influence decision-making and behavior"
    },
    {
      "factor": "drug use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's history of using drugs in the past four years may indicate a higher risk of future substance abuse-related issues, which could contribute to rearrest within three years"
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Not being married or living alone might suggest instability or lack of responsibility, but it's not necessarily a direct predictor of future arrests"
    },
    {
      "factor": " religiosity",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Considering God has something to do with what happens to him personally may indicate that the person is more likely to be responsible and follow rules, thus reducing the risk of rearrest within three years"
    },
    {
      "factor": "height",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While height is not directly predictive, being significantly taller than average (6 feet 1 inch) may indicate greater potential for physical strength or influence, which could be used to intimidate others and increase the risk of arrest."
