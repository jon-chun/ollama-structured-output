  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "As an 18-year-old male, he has already demonstrated a pattern of risky behavior (10 arrests) and is at high risk of future recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Background",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "His past involvement in substance abuse and his exposure to violence from drug use suggest that he may be particularly vulnerable to further arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education Level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Given the lack of formal education, it is unlikely that this factor will have a significant impact on his likelihood of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital Status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "His current single status may suggest some level of independence and reduced stressors, but the lack of a supportive partner or family structure does not automatically disqualify him from recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment History",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "His history of unemployment may indicate underlying personal issues that could impact his ability to navigate the criminal justice system and lead a law-abiding life."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental Health",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While he has not felt depressed in the past month, this factor may be less relevant given the absence of depressive symptoms. However, his history of substance abuse and exposure to trauma suggest that mental health issues could play a role in recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Housing Situation",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "His living situation may provide some level of stability, but the lack of support from family or community may still pose significant risks to his well-being and ability to engage in positive activities."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Given that he has used drugs for four years, it is clear that substance use poses a substantial risk of recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Racial Identity",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "His racial identity may be perceived as 'White,' which could lead to societal biases or stigma that may impact his ability to access resources, employment, and social support."
