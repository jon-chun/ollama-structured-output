  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "An 18-year-old is considered a young adult with more opportunities for mistakes than older adults. This increases the likelihood of being rearrested."
    },
    {
      "factor": "convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been convicted multiple times may indicate that the individual is more prone to future offenses, increasing the risk of re-arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "physical characteristics",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Height and weight can be associated with body mass index (BMI), which has been linked to various health risks. Being in a higher BMI category may indicate that the individual is at increased risk for certain health issues, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Additionally, being significantly overweight may also increase the risk of mental health problems, such as depression."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having never attended college and holding a GED certificate indicates that the individual is likely to have limited education and potentially lower socio-economic status. This may increase the risk of re-arrest due to decreased access to job opportunities, better health care, or other factors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having held only one job during the past year indicates a lack of work experience and skills. This may increase the risk of re-arrest due to decreased ability to secure employment or navigate complex social situations."
    },
    {
      "factor": "drug use",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Using drugs in the past four years, particularly marijuana and cocaine, is associated with a higher risk of mental health problems, substance abuse, and other negative outcomes. This may increase the individual's likelihood of re-arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being unmarried and living alone without a spouse indicates that the individual is more vulnerable to financial, social, and relationship stress. This may increase the risk of re-arrest due to decreased support system or increased likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Considering that God has something to do with what happens to him personally, this factor may be interpreted as a sign or blessing. However, the relationship between faith and crime is complex and not directly correlated."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age of living",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "At age 18, the individual is considered young adulthood, where individuals are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors. This may increase the likelihood of re-arrest due to increased impulsivity and lack of life experience."
    },
    {
      "factor": "rural location",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being an urban resident indicates that the individual is likely to have access to more resources, education, and social services. However, living in a rural area may also be associated with higher levels of crime rates due to lower economic conditions and greater isolation."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family size",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having lived with both biological parents in an urban household indicates that the individual has a close-knit family environment. This may be associated with increased social support, reduced exposure to negative influences, and improved mental health outcomes."
    },
    {
      "factor": "rural residence",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Living in an urban area is likely to increase the individual's exposure to various risk factors, including crime rates, poverty levels, and social services. This may be associated with higher risks of re-arrest due to increased stress, isolation, and limited access to resources."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age at identification",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being identified as a young adult at age 18 is more likely to be associated with higher risks of re-arrest due to increased impulsivity, lack of life experience, and decreased access to resources."
    },
    {
      "factor": "rural residence",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The presence of a rural location may indicate that the individual has limited exposure to urban influences, resources, and social services. This may increase the risk of re-arrest due to increased isolation and lack of access to support networks."
