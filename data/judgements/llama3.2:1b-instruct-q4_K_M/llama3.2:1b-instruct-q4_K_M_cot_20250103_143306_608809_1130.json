    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "As an adult, the likelihood of rearrest decreases with age"
    },
    {
      "factor": "education",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Although not a direct predictor, having a GED certificate may reduce the risk of rearrest due to reduced access to job opportunities and legal education resources"
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment history",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person has held only one job during the year, indicating limited work experience and potential instability in employment"
    },
    {
      "factor": "housing stability",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Living alone with no previous residence may increase the risk of rearrest due to lack of support networks or safety concerns"
    },
    {
      "factor": "divorce or separation history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having experienced marital problems in the past, which may indicate instability in personal relationships and emotional well-being"
    },
    {
      "factor": "drug use",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person has not felt depressed over the past month, suggesting that drug use is unlikely to be a significant risk factor for rearrest"
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being single may increase the risk of rearrest due to lack of social support and potential increased vulnerability to crime"
    },
    {
      "factor": "family ties",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lack of biological parents living together and being raised in an urban area with a household of size 4 may indicate limited family support and resources"
    },
    {
      "factor": "religion",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Considering God's involvement, this factor may be weighted as 'high' to account for the potential impact of faith on personal decisions and life outcomes"
