  "prediction": "YES",

  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person is an adult, which increases the likelihood of recidivism. A study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that adults are more likely to be arrested than juveniles."
    },
    {
      "factor": "race",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "There may not be a direct correlation between racial background and recidivism rates, but the person's White status might contribute to lower likelihood due to potential biases in the justice system."
    },
    {
      "factor": "sex",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Research suggests that males are more likely to be arrested than females. Additionally, men aged 18-24 have a higher recidivism rate compared to their peers."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While having a GED certificate is an indicator of potential education and employability, it does not directly correlate with recidivism rates. However, the lack of formal education might contribute to decreased job opportunities and income stability."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being unmarried increases the likelihood of involvement in illicit activities, as individuals may seek more financial stability through crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in a household with both biological parents could contribute to a stronger sense of community and support networks, potentially lowering recidivism rates."
    },
    {
      "factor": "occupational status",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having held one job during the year may indicate financial stability, which can improve mental health and reduce the likelihood of drug use. Additionally, being able to find a stable income might contribute to reduced reliance on illicit substances."
    },
    {
      "factor": "substance abuse",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's past involvement in substance abuse may have been related to coping mechanisms rather than a genuine addiction. However, the lack of long-term recovery efforts might contribute to continued reliance on illicit substances."
    },
    {
      "factor": "depression",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having not felt depressed over the past month could indicate a lack of emotional distress or potential underlying mental health issues. However, the person's history of substance abuse and low self-esteem might contribute to increased stress levels."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age at departure from home",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Being 18 years old may be considered young for leaving home, potentially leading to an increase in independence and a reduced reliance on family support systems. This could also contribute to increased exposure to peer pressure."
    },
    {
      "factor": "urbanization",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an urban area may have contributed to the person's exposure to various social environments, which can influence decision-making and behavior."
