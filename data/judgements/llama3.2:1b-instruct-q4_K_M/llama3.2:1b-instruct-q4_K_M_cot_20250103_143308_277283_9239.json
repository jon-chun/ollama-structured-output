  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Age at arrest",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "As a 18-year-old male, being arrested at such a young age may indicate potential for future delinquency"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Conviction history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having been convicted multiple times suggests a pattern of behavior that may be associated with higher risk of recidivism"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Sexual orientation",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "There is no indication in the provided information about the person's sexual orientation, which may not be relevant to their likelihood of being rearrested within 3 years"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having held only one job and been unemployed for a year may indicate a lack of stability or skills, which could increase the risk of future arrests"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Using drugs in the past four years may indicate a history of substance abuse, which can be associated with increased risk of recidivism and subsequent arrest"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lacking symptoms of depression for the past month suggests that this factor may not significantly impact the prediction"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Marital status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being unmarried and currently living alone may indicate a higher likelihood of involvement in illicit activities or other factors contributing to arrest"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education level",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having only a GED certificate and not enrolling in college suggests limited access to resources, education, and support services, which could increase the risk of recidivism"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family structure",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Living alone with biological parents in an urban area may indicate exposure to trauma or instability, contributing factors for future arrest"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Height (feet and inches)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being 6 feet 1 inch tall may contribute to the individual's perceived importance within certain circles, potentially increasing feelings of entitlement or disrespect that could lead to arrest"
    },
    {
      "factor": "Weight (lbs)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having a significant amount of weight may indicate physical strength and possibly an increased likelihood of engaging in high-risk activities"
