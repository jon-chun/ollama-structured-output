      {
        "factor": "Age",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Given that the individual is an 18-year-old male who has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted, it suggests a higher likelihood of future recidivism."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Conviction history",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "A conviction indicates a prior offense, which increases the risk of future re-offending. Additionally, this history may be indicative of underlying issues that could lead to recidivism."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Marital status",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "A unmarried individual without children is at a higher risk of incarceration due to the potential for homelessness and lack of stable support systems."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Physical characteristics",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person's height (6 feet 1 inch) and weight (195 lbs) are not indicative of a higher risk of reoffending, as these factors do not directly correlate with recidivism."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Education level",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person's GED certificate and lack of college enrollment suggest limited education opportunities, which could contribute to reoffending."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Job history",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "A history of unemployment may indicate underlying issues that led to incarceration, such as poverty or lack of job skills."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Substance use",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "The person's past four years of substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) increases the risk of future addiction, which can lead to recidivism."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Depression",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "There is no indication that the person feels depressed over the past month, which suggests a lower likelihood of reoffending."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Religion",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "The individual's consideration of God's involvement in his life may indicate a higher sense of purpose and responsibility, potentially reducing the risk of recidivism."
