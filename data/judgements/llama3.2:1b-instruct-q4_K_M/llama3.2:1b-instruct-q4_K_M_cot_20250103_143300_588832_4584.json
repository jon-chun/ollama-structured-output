    {
      "factor": "education_level",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person has never attended college and is not currently enrolled, which suggests a potential lack of skills or knowledge that may contribute to future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "family_structure",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While the person's biological parents were supportive, living with both in an urban area at age 18 might not have provided adequate supervision and guidance."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age_at_first_arrest",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person is significantly older than his first arrest, which may suggest that he has had more time to develop habits or patterns that contribute to future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "drugg_use",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Based on the past four years of drug use and not feeling depressed, it is likely that this factor will be less relevant in the next three years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "marital_status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The person's marital status may not have a direct impact on his likelihood of being rearrested within three years, as long as he is living alone and has no family obligations that could distract him from crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "housing_status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's household size of four and urban upbringing may not be a significant risk factor for future arrests, given the lack of social structure or community support."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age_of_birth_at_first_arrest",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person is significantly younger than his first arrest, which suggests that he may be more likely to repeat patterns of behavior over time."

      "factor": "income",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While the person's income is not mentioned, it may not have a direct impact on his likelihood of being rearrested within three years, as long as he does not have significant financial obligations that could distract him from crime."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment_status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's job has been held for one year and is not mentioned as being at risk of termination, which may suggest that he is less likely to be rearrested within the next three years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "demographics",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's age (18), sex (male), and racial background (White) are not mentioned as being relevant risk factors for future arrests, assuming they do not have significant social or economic disadvantages."
    },
    {
      "factor": "mental_state",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person's mental state is described as not feeling depressed over the past month, which suggests that he may be less likely to experience a psychotic break or other mental health issues that could contribute to future arrests."

      "factor": "substance_use",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Based on the information provided, it is unlikely that substance use will have a significant impact on his likelihood of being rearrested within three years."
