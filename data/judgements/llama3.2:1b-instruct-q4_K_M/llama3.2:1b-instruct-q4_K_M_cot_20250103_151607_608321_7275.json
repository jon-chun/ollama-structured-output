      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. This suggests that he may have a higher likelihood of future arrests due to his age, which is considered a risk factor for repeat offending."
    },

      "factor": "type of offense",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person has been arrested multiple times, including convictions. This suggests that he may have more opportunities to be rearrested in the future due to his type of offenses."

      "factor": "current employment status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "The person has held only one job during the year, indicating a lack of stability or consistent income. This could be seen as a risk factor for future arrests due to his current employment situation."
