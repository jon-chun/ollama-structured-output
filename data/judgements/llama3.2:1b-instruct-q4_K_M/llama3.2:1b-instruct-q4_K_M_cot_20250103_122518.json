  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "age at first arrest",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "At 18, the person is likely to have a higher risk of reoffending given their lack of work experience and education."
    },
    {
      "factor": "number of arrests in past 10 years",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been arrested 10 times increases the likelihood of future recidivism."
    },
    {
      "factor": "current marital status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being single may reduce the pressure to conform and engage in risk-taking behaviors compared to those with a partner or family responsibilities."
    },
    {
      "factor": "education level",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Lack of education is often associated with higher crime rates, suggesting that this person's lack of formal education may contribute to his higher risk of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "employment status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having been unemployed for a year and lacking any job experience suggests that he is vulnerable to exploitation by others or may not have developed the necessary skills to secure stable employment, increasing his risk of reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "drugging habits",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While this person has used drugs in the past four years, it is unclear whether these experiences will lead to further substance abuse or addiction, which could impact his likelihood of reoffending within the next three years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "depression",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having not felt depressed over the past month suggests that this person may be less prone to severe mental health issues, potentially reducing his risk of reoffending compared to those with untreated depression or other mental health concerns."
    },
    {
      "factor": "age of biological parents",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Lived in a household of size 4 with both biological parents may have contributed to the person's upbringing and potentially influenced his behaviors, reducing his risk of reoffending within the next three years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "urban vs. rural area",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Having grown up in an urban household with limited access to resources may have exposed this person to more challenges and stressors, potentially increasing his risk of reoffending within the next three years."
    },
    {
      "factor": "consideration for God",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "This factor is subjective and lacks concrete evidence; however, it may be interpreted as a sign of resilience or optimism, potentially indicating that this person will not engage in self-destructive behaviors or recidivism."
