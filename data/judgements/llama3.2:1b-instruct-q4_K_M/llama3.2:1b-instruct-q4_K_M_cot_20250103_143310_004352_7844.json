  "prediction": "NO",

  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Conviction history",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person has been arrested 10 times, which suggests a higher likelihood of future arrests. While conviction is not the sole determining factor, it increases the risk of re-arrestation."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Age and youthfulness",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "As an 18-year-old male, he may still be considered a young adult with more opportunities for growth and development. His youthfulness might also indicate better resilience to stress and adversity."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Physical characteristics",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While physical attributes like height and weight are not directly correlated with re-arrestation, they could be seen as neutral factors in a risk assessment. However, given the person's other risk factors, these may have little to no impact."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The person has never been enrolled in college, which suggests limited personal development and potential for future instability."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Employment history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Although the person has held only one job, it is possible that this may be a fluke or indicate underlying issues. His lack of experience could also lead to financial instability and increased stress."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Drug use and past",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's history of drug use and previous convictions raise significant concerns about his ability to manage stressors and make positive choices. This, combined with his lack of motivation and depression, increases the likelihood of re-arrestation."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Mental health",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The person's past experiences may indicate underlying issues that could impact his mental state in the future. His lack of recent depression suggests some resilience, but this is not sufficient to mitigate the risk."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family background",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Although the person's biological parents' household size and urban location may have provided a stable environment, his current living situation with one roommate suggests potential for increased stress and instability."
