    {
      "factor": "Multiple previous arrests and convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Having been arrested 10 times and convicted suggests a pattern of behavior that may lead to future arrests."

    {
      "factor": "Past drug use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While past use does not necessarily predict future issues, it is a risk factor given the potential for relapse or new substance-related offenses."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Limited education and employment history",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Lack of formal education and stable employment could contribute to economic stress, potentially leading to future criminal activity."

    {
      "factor": "Personal religious beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious beliefs are generally not a direct predictor of criminal behavior. While they may influence personal choices, the data does not indicate a high correlation with re-arrest rates."

      "factor": "Age and gender",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Being young male is not necessarily a risk factor for re-arrest. Many youth avoid arrest, while some may be more prone to it depending on other circumstances."

      "factor": "Family history and upbringing",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents could have had positive or negative impacts. Without further detail, the impact on future criminal behavior is unclear."
