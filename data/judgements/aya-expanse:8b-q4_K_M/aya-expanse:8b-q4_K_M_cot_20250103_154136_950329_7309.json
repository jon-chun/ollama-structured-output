    {
      "factor": "Multiple Arrests and Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The individual has a history of ten arrests and a conviction, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. This is a strong predictor of future rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Demographics (Age, Gender, Ethnicity)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being 18-years-old, male, and White does not significantly increase the risk in isolation. However, these factors can be considered alongside other personal circumstances."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education and Employment",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not being married, living alone, having a GED, and only one job during the year do not strongly indicate future criminal activity. Many individuals with similar backgrounds do not reoffend."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a concern, but without recent relapses or indications of severe addiction, it is not a high-risk factor. The absence of depression suggests better self-control."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an urban area with both biological parents and four siblings does not strongly influence future rearrest rates. This early environment is less predictive than current personal circumstances."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Spiritual Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Believing in God's role in personal life is generally not a direct predictor of criminal behavior. While it might influence some behaviors, it does not significantly impact the likelihood of rearrest."
