      "factor": "Multiple Arrests and Convictions",

      "factor": "Age and Past Drug Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "At 18 years old, he is still young enough to be influenced by peer pressure and may have a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Past drug use suggests potential substance abuse issues that could contribute to future criminal activity."

      "factor": "Educational and Employment Status",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Not being enrolled in college and having only held one job during the year may indicate limited opportunities or challenges, but it does not directly correlate with high re-arrest rates."

      "factor": "Personal Beliefs and Family History",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "His religious beliefs might offer a supportive network but do not inherently impact his propensity for crime. Growing up in an urban area with a size 4 household at a young age could have influenced his social environment, but without further context, the effect is uncertain."
