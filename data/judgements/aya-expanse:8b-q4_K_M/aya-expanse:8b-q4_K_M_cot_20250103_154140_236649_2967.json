    {
      "factor": "Multiple Arrests and Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The individual has a history of ten arrests and one conviction, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior which significantly increases the likelihood of future arrests."

      "factor": "Demographic and Socioeconomic Status (White, male, young, no college education)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "These factors can influence recidivism rates, with age and educational attainment potentially playing a role. However, demographic factors alone are not definitive predictors."

      "factor": "Substance Use (marijuana, cocaine)",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior, especially when coupled with other risk factors."

      "factor": "Emotional State (no reported depression)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "While mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, the absence of reported depression suggests a lower immediate risk."
