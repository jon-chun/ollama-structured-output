  "risk_factors": [
    {
      "factor": "Multiple Arrests and Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The individual has a history of frequent arrests (10 times) and convictions, indicating potential recurring legal issues."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Past Drug Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "While past drug use is noted, the absence of recent or ongoing depression suggests a possible lower risk of continued substance abuse leading to arrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Demographics (Age, Ethnicity, Education)",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "These factors alone are not strong predictors of future rearrest. Many young adults from diverse backgrounds face similar challenges without necessarily reoffending."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Emotional Well-being",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "The absence of depression, while positive, does not guarantee a complete absence of future emotional struggles that could potentially lead to criminal activity."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background and Urban Living",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in an urban environment and having experienced a stable family structure (biological parents) could influence resilience against negative environments, but urban living also presents unique challenges."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Spiritual Beliefs",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Religious or spiritual beliefs can offer guidance and support, but they are generally not direct predictors of criminal behavior."
