    {
      "factor": "Multiple Arrests and Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The individual has a history of 10 arrests and a conviction, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior, which significantly increases the risk of future rearrest."

    {
      "factor": "Demographic and Socioeconomic Status",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being young (18), male, White, with a low level of education (GED) and limited employment history could contribute to certain environmental risks, but the impact may vary depending on other personal factors."

      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a concern, as it can lead to relapsing behaviors. However, the absence of recent depression might suggest a lower risk for severe substance abuse at this time."
