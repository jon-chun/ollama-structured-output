    {
      "factor": "Multiple Arrests and Convictions",
      "weight": "high",
      "reasoning": "The individual has a history of ten arrests and one conviction, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor for future rearrest."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Demographics (Age, Ethnicity)",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Being 18 years old and White does not necessarily indicate higher risk, but these demographics can influence societal perceptions and opportunities, which could indirectly impact future criminal activity."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Education and Employment",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate and one job during the year do not strongly correlate with future rearrest. Lack of higher education is not a significant predictor in this context."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Substance Use",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) could contribute to reoffending, especially if it continues or intensifies. However, the absence of depression suggests potential for better decision-making."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Family Background",
      "weight": "low",
      "reasoning": "Growing up in a four-person household with both biological parents in an urban area is not inherently risky. This factor has limited influence on the likelihood of future arrests."
    },
    {
      "factor": "Spiritual Beliefs",
      "weight": "medium",
      "reasoning": "Believing in God's role in personal life can be a positive or negative influence, depending on how it shapes one's choices. It might provide support but could also lead to moral conflicts if not aligned with societal norms."
