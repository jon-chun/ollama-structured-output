        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "While not explicitly stated, the person's identification as White and being an '18-year-old male' may imply he identifies with conservative values or a more traditional lifestyle, which could be associated with lower risk factors for crime."

        "factor": "race",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person's White identity and lack of explicitly stated racial background make it difficult to infer any specific risk factors related to race."

        "factor": "education_level",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "While the person has a GED certificate, his lack of enrollment in college and history of drug use may suggest that he is not using this information to inform his risk factor assessment."

        "factor": "employment_status",
        "weight": "medium",
