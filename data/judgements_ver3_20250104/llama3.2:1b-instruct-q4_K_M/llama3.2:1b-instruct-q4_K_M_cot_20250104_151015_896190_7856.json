        "factor": "Conviction history",
        "weight": "medium",

        "factor": "Physical characteristics",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "While being tall and heavy might contribute to a higher risk of health problems, it is not a strong predictor of rearrest."

        "factor": "Education level",

        "factor": "Marijuana use",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "While marijuana use is considered a risk factor for future arrests, it may not be a direct indicator of rearrest given the person's overall profile."

        "factor": "Cocaine use",
        "weight": "medium",

        "factor": "Family situation",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Living alone with no biological parents may indicate a higher risk due to lack of support systems or supervision, but this factor is not as strong a predictor as others listed here."
