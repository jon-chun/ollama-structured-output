      {
        "factor": "Lived_with_both_biological_parents",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Given the person's background and living situation, it is plausible that he may have a strong sense of protection from his biological parents, which could influence his decision-making process when it comes to involvement with law enforcement."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Current_Living_Situation",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person's current living situation as a single adult and not being married may lead him to seek alternative means of support, which could increase his likelihood of involvement with law enforcement."

      {
        "factor": "Physical_Attribution_of_Problems",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Given the person's physical attributes (height and weight), it is possible that he may attribute any problems or issues to external factors rather than internal ones, which could influence his decision-making process when it comes to involvement with law enforcement."

      {
        "factor": "Substance_Use",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person's history of using drugs in the past four years may have contributed to his current state, but it is unclear whether he will continue to use substances and how this may impact his involvement with law enforcement."

      {
        "factor": "Previous_Criminal_Past",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Given the person's history of being arrested multiple times, it is possible that he may have a pattern of behavior that could lead to further involvement with law enforcement in the future."

      {
        "factor": "Age-at_Incarceration",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Given the person's age at the time of his first arrest (18 years old), it is possible that he may be more prone to involvement with law enforcement due to developmental factors."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Education_Level",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Given the person's lack of education and GED certificate, it is possible that he may not have a strong support system or access to resources that could help him avoid involvement with law enforcement."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Income_Level",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person's current income level (1 job) may not provide him with the financial resources he needs to support himself, which could increase his likelihood of involvement with law enforcement."

      {
        "factor": "Lack_of_College",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person's lack of college education may not provide him with the skills or knowledge he needs to navigate the criminal justice system, which could increase his likelihood of involvement with law enforcement."

        "factor": "Past_Risk_Factors",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person's history of using drugs and living with his biological parents may not be directly related to his likelihood of being rearrested within the next three years."

      {
        "factor": "Mental_State",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Given the person's history of feeling depressed, it is possible that he may have a stronger sense of vulnerability to involvement with law enforcement due to mental health factors."
