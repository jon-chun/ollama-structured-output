      {
        "factor": "Age at first arrest",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Given that the person is an 18-year-old male and has been arrested 10 times, it's unlikely he will be rearrested within 3 years."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Number of arrests in past 5 years",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person has already had a significant number of arrests and convictions, which suggests that he may not have the necessary skills or support systems to avoid future problems."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Number of arrests in last 5 years",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person has been arrested multiple times recently, which increases his risk of being rearrested."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Current employment status",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Given that the person has held only one job during the year and is currently living alone, it's possible that he may not have a stable or secure employment, increasing his risk of being rearrested."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Education level",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, which suggests that he may not have the necessary education or skills to support himself financially or employment-wise."
      },
      {
        "factor": "History of drug use",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Given that the person has used drugs in the past four years, it's possible that he may still be vulnerable to addiction and/or substance abuse."

      {
        "factor": "Depression",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person has not felt depressed over the past month, which suggests that he may not have a significant depression history or underlying mental health issues."

      {
        "factor": "Biological parent support",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Given that the person lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, it's possible that he may have had a supportive family environment or at least some level of parental guidance and supervision."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Racial identity",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Given that the person identifies as White, which is often associated with lower socioeconomic status and less access to resources, it's possible that his racial identity may be linked to his risk of being rearrested."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Religious beliefs",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "The person considers God has something to do with what happens to him personally, which suggests that he may have a strong faith or spiritual practice that could potentially support his mental health and resilience."
