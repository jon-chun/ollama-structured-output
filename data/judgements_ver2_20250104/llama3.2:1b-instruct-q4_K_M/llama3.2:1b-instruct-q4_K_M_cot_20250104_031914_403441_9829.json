      {
        "factor": "Age",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "At 18 years old, he has already experienced multiple arrests and convictions. This indicates a higher risk of rearrest in the future."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Racial Identity",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "His identification as White may be a predictor of lower risk due to potential implicit biases against minority groups. However, this factor is still somewhat speculative."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Physical Characteristics",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "As a tall and heavy male, he may have greater physical strength and resistance to arrest. Additionally, his height may make him more difficult to apprehend in certain situations."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Family Background",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "His upbringing in a household of size 4 with biological parents indicates some level of stability and support. This could potentially contribute to his lower risk profile."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Education Level",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Although he has a GED certificate, this may not be considered a high-level education credential by law enforcement agencies. Additionally, his lack of enrollment in college suggests some level of disengagement from formal education."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Employment History",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Having held only one job during the year may indicate some level of instability or lack of career advancement opportunities. This could potentially contribute to his lower risk profile."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Substance Abuse History",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "His past use of marijuana and cocaine suggests a potential for substance abuse, which may increase his risk of future arrests. However, this factor is still somewhat speculative."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Depression",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "As he has not felt depressed over the past month, it is possible that this factor does not contribute significantly to his risk profile."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Religion",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "His consideration of God's involvement in his life suggests a higher level of spirituality and potentially lower risk due to the influence of religious beliefs. However, this factor is still somewhat speculative."
      },
      {
        "factor": "Home Environment",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "His living alone with no biological parents in an urban area may indicate some level of isolation or disconnection from community resources. This could potentially contribute to his lower risk profile."
