        "factor": "age",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "He is an 18-year-old male who has been arrested multiple times, which may indicate a higher risk of future recidivism."
      },
      {
        "factor": "ethnicity",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "While his White ethnicity is not explicitly stated, being a minority in the urban setting with a strong religious faith could potentially influence his worldview and behavior."
      },
      {
        "factor": "family life",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "His living situation as an unmarried, non-colleged individual may indicate instability or stress, but it's difficult to conclude whether this is a direct risk factor for recidivism."
      },
      {
        "factor": "education level",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Having held 1 job and not being in college may suggest a lack of self-awareness or support system, which could contribute to poor decision-making and increased risk."

      {
        "factor": "job history",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "His short work history indicates limited professional experience, which may make it harder for him to develop coping mechanisms or seek employment outside his current situation."
      },
      {
        "factor": "drug use",
        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "His past use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) could indicate addiction, impulsivity, or a lack of self-regulation, all of which can increase the likelihood of future recidivism."
      },
      {
        "factor": "emotional state",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "While he mentions feeling depressed over the past month, this is presented as a short-term condition rather than an ongoing issue."
      },
      {
        "factor": "cognitive abilities",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "His lack of education and high GED level suggest potential cognitive limitations or challenges in decision-making, which could impact his ability to navigate the criminal justice system effectively."
      },
      {
        "factor": "family beliefs",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "His strong religious faith may provide a sense of purpose and guidance, potentially reducing stress and anxiety that could contribute to recidivism."

        "factor": "physical characteristics",
        "weight": "high",
