        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Living with both biological parents in an urban area may provide some level of social support, but it does not necessarily mitigate the risks associated with being arrested and convicted."

      {
        "factor": "Education Level",
        "weight": "low",
        "reasoning": "Having a GED certificate and not enrolling in college suggests that this individual may be limited in their education and employability options."

        "factor": "Employment History",
        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Holding only one job during the year suggests some level of employment stability, but it is not necessarily indicative of future success or security."

        "weight": "medium",
        "reasoning": "Considering God has something to do with what happens to him personally may suggest a higher level of motivation and resilience, but it is not necessarily indicative of future behavior."

        "weight": "high",
        "reasoning": "Being 6 feet 1 inch and weighing 195 lbs suggests physical strength and potentially increased aggression, which may increase the likelihood of recidivism."
