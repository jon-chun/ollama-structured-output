    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a moderate level of risk for recidivism, not high risk. Here's why:\n\n1. Age and gender: Being an 18-year-old male does not significantly contribute to a high risk of recidivism.\n2. Arrest history: Having been arrested once without prior convictions is generally less predictive of future criminal behavior.\n3. Physical characteristics: The person's height and weight do not indicate a higher risk level.\n4. Marital status and living situation: Living alone, especially at a young age, does not significantly contribute to recidivism risks.\n5. Education: Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n6. Employment history: Holding multiple jobs during the year might suggest adaptability but does not necessarily indicate criminal risk.\n7. Substance use: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) can be a factor in recidivism, but the frequency of recent use is relatively low. Feeling down for extended periods could indicate mental health concerns that warrant attention. However, these factors alone do not indicate high risk without additional context.\n8. Family background: Living with a biological mother in an urban area and having a small family size can be associated with higher risks, but the absence of specific details on familial or environmental issues does not support a high-risk prediction.\n9. Spiritual beliefs: Belief in God or a higher power is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nOverall, these factors suggest a moderate risk level for recidivism. The lack of specific details on certain factors (e.g., mental health concerns) limits the confidence in this prediction.",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
