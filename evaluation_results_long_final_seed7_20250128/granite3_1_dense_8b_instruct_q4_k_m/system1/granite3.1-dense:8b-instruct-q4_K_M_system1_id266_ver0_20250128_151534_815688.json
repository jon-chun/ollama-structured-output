    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe risk factors presented do not indicate a high risk for recidivism. The individual is young, has only been arrested once and convicted once, which suggests limited criminal history. He does not report feelings of depression over the past month, which is a positive factor in terms of mental health. His living situation, although not ideal (living alone), does not present significant risk factors such as substance abuse or family dysfunction. The fact that he has held down one job during the year also indicates some level of stability.\n\nHowever, there are some risk factors to consider: his lack of formal education and GED certificate could potentially limit his employment opportunities in the future, which might lead to financial strain and increased risk for criminal behavior. His drug use, specifically marijuana, is also a factor that could indicate higher risk, especially if used regularly or in larger quantities.\n\nOverall, considering these factors together, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence of 65%. This assessment could change based on additional information about his criminal history, substance use patterns, employment history, and other relevant factors.",
