The individual is enrolled in school, which is a protective factor against criminal behavior. He has never been married and lives alone, suggesting he may have established a pro-social identity and support network. His current employment suggests financial stability and self-sufficiency. Although he has used drugs in the past, there is no indication of ongoing substance abuse or dependence, and he does not report feeling depressed. His religious belief could also be a protective factor against criminal behavior. The fact that he was raised in a large family in an urban area, while potentially posing some risks, is outweighed by the other positive factors. Therefore, the confidence in predicting high risk is low.",
