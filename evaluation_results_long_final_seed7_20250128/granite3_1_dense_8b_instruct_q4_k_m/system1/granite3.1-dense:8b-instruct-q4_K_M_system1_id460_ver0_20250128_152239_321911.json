While having been arrested but not convicted does not directly indicate high risk, it can be associated with other risk factors such as criminal behavior or association. The individual's educational background (GED) and employment history may suggest instability, which is often linked to higher recidivism rates. Additionally, his lack of religious belief could potentially correlate with lower self-control or moral constraints, although this is less certain than other factors.",
