The individual's age, gender, and racial background do not typically correlate with high risk behavior. Her criminal history is limited to one arrest without conviction. She has a stable living situation and is not currently enrolled in college, but she does have some work experience. Her substance use, while present, is not severe or recent enough to indicate high risk. The individual's personal beliefs and early family composition do not suggest a propensity for criminal behavior. However, the reported symptoms of depression are concerning and should be closely monitored as they could potentially escalate into higher-risk behaviors if left unaddressed.",
