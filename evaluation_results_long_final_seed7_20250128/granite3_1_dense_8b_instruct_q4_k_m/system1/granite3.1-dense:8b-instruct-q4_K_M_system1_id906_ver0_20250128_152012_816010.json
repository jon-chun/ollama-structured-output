The individual's age, gender, and criminal history are relatively low-risk indicators. He has had only one arrest and conviction, which is a lower-risk factor. His physical attributes (height and weight) and employment history (holding multiple jobs) do not suggest high risk. He does not have a history of drug use or depression, both of which are associated with higher risk levels. While living with adults other than biological parents at a young age could be a potential risk factor, it is mitigated by the fact that this was in a household of only three people, suggesting it might not have been a dysfunctional environment. His religious belief does not directly correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, based on these factors, he is considered to be at low risk for recidivism, albeit with a moderate level of confidence due to the limited information provided.",
