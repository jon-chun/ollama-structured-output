    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low risk individual for several reasons. First, the individual's age (21) is within the typical range for young adults who are less likely to have extensive criminal histories compared to older individuals. Second, the low number of arrests and lack of convictions indicate a minimal involvement in criminal activity. Third, her physical attributes do not contribute significantly to risk assessment. Fourth, the fact that she has held 2 jobs during the year suggests a level of stability and employability.\n\nHowever, there are also some factors that could potentially increase risk: her weight (obesity can be linked to health issues which might indirectly impact behavior), drug use (marijuana use, while not as severe as other substances, is still illegal and may indicate a disregard for rules), and chronic sadness (this suggests potential mental health concerns that could potentially lead to self-destructive behaviors).\n\nDespite these factors, the overall risk appears low due to the limited criminal history and lack of convictions. The confidence level is moderate as predicting human behavior, especially in a criminal context, is complex and multifaceted, often relying on a combination of factors that may not be fully represented in this dataset.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
