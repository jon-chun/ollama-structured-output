    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe risk factors provided indicate a relatively low level of risk for several reasons. The individual's age (21), gender, and arrest history (one time with no conviction) do not suggest a high propensity for criminal behavior. Her height, weight, marital status, and current living situation are also not indicative of high risk.\n\nThe fact that she has not held a job in the past year could potentially indicate some level of instability or difficulty with employment, which might correlate with higher risk. However, this factor is somewhat mitigated by her completion of at least some formal education (even if it's just high school), as well as her current enrollment in college (if she were enrolled).\n\nHer past drug use and lack of depression do not suggest severe psychological or substance abuse issues, which could be risk factors. The fact that she does not feel depressed over the past month is a positive indicator.\n\nHer family background includes living with her mother in an urban area as part of a larger household, but there are no indications of severe familial or environmental stressors that might contribute to criminal behavior. Her religious beliefs, while not directly related to risk assessment, do not suggest any indicators of anti-social behavior.\n\nOverall, the combination of these factors does not indicate a high level of risk for criminal recidivism or violent behavior. However, it's important to note that this prediction is based solely on the provided information and may not account for other unmentioned factors that could influence her risk profile.",
