The individual is young, has no prior convictions, and is currently enrolled in school, which are all indicators of lower risk. However, her drug use and feelings of depression are concerning. Her frequent job changes might also be indicative of instability, but without more context (like the reason for the job changes), it's difficult to gauge their significance. The fact that she identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander and lives alone does not contribute significantly to risk assessment in this context. Overall, while there are some red flags, they do not collectively indicate a high risk of criminal behavior.",

She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
