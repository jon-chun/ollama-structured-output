However, past drug use and recent feelings of depression indicate some level of concern. The contextual factors, such as growing up in a rural area with her biological mother and current living arrangements alone, do not significantly contribute to the risk assessment. Her religious beliefs may potentially act as a protective factor against criminal behavior. Considering these factors together, the overall risk is considered low to moderate.",
