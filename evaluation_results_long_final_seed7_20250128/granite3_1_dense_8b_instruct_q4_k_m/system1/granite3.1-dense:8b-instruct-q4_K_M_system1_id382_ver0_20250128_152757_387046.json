    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a low to moderate risk for several reasons:\n\n1. Age: At 19 years old, this individual is still relatively young and may not have developed long-term criminal patterns.\n2. Arrest history: Although he has been arrested once, the lack of convictions suggests that he might not pose a significant ongoing risk.\n3. Employment history: The fact that he has held multiple jobs in the year indicates stability and potential engagement in society.\n4. Drug use: While past drug use is concerning, the fact that it was limited to marijuana and did not occur recently suggests lower risk.\n5. Mental health: Not feeling depressed over the past month reduces concerns about internal struggles leading to criminal behavior.\n6. Family background: Growing up with both parents in an urban area might indicate a stable upbringing, reducing the likelihood of future criminal involvement.\n7. Religious beliefs: Believing that God has something to do with personal events may imply a moral compass and lower risk for criminal behavior.\n\nThe high school diploma and lack of college enrollment, along with living alone, are neutral factors. The gender (male) and race (White) are also not indicative of high-risk status on their own. Given the absence of significant criminal history, ongoing substance abuse, or mental health issues, the overall risk is considered low to moderate.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consider that this assessment is based solely on provided information and does not account for potential unknown factors or contextual details.",
