    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low level of recidivism risk based on the following reasons:\n\n1. Age and Gender: The individual is young (22 years old) and female, both of which are associated with lower risk of reoffending compared to older males.\n\n2. Prior Arrests without Conviction: Although she has been arrested twice, not being convicted suggests that there may have been mitigating circumstances or lack of evidence against her.\n\n3. Employment History: Having held 3 jobs during the year indicates stability and employability, which is generally associated with lower risk.\n\n4. Education Level: Possessing a high school diploma but not being enrolled in college suggests that she has basic education without any ongoing learning opportunities or commitments.\n\n5. Substance Use: Although she has used drugs (marijuana) in the past, there is no indication of regular heavy use or substance-related problems, which would be a more significant risk factor.\n\n6. Mental Health: Feeling down \"some of the time\" during the past month indicates mild depressive symptoms but does not suggest severe mental health issues that could increase her risk.\n\n7. Upbringing: Growing up in an urban area with multiple siblings and living with her biological mother until adulthood suggests a relatively stable family environment.\n\n8. Personal Beliefs: The individual's belief in God may contribute to a sense of personal responsibility, which could be protective against reoffending.\n\nThe main risk factors present are the prior arrests without conviction and mild depressive symptoms. However, considering these factors alongside the numerous stabilizing elements in her background, the overall risk level is low to moderate. The confidence in this prediction is relatively low (20%) due to the limited information provided on her substance use patterns, mental health history, and specific circumstances surrounding her arrests.",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
