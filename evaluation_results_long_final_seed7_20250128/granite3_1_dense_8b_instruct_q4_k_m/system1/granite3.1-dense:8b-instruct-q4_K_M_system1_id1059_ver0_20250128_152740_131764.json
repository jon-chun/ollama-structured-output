    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low risk level. Here's the rationale:\n\n1. Age (22): Young age is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n2. Gender (Male): While males can have higher crime rates in some studies, this factor alone does not indicate high risk.\n3. Arrest history: Only one arrest without conviction suggests a low level of criminal involvement.\n4. Physical attributes: Height and weight are not significant predictors of recidivism.\n5. Marital status (Never married): Not being married does not indicate high risk.\n6. Living arrangement (Living alone): This is not a strong predictor of criminal behavior.\n7. Education: Having completed high school with no college enrollment suggests some level of stability.\n8. Employment history: Holding two jobs during the year indicates employability and stability.\n9. Substance use: Past marijuana use is common and does not necessarily indicate high risk, especially considering the lack of recent depression symptoms.\n10. Family background: Living in an urban area with a large family (size 5) can be associated with higher crime rates, but the absence of depression symptoms and stable employment suggest otherwise.\n11. Personal beliefs: Considering God has something to do with personal events is not indicative of high risk.\n\nThe low confidence score reflects that while none of these factors alone indicates high risk, individual circumstances may vary, and this assessment is based on general statistical trends rather than specific details.",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
