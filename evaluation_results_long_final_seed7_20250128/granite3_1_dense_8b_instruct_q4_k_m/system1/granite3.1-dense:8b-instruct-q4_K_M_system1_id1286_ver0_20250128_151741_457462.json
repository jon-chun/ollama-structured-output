The individual is young, has not been convicted of any crimes, and does not have a history of drug use or depression. He is currently enrolled in school and living alone, which suggests stability. The lack of employment may be a concern, but it is outweighed by the other positive factors. His racial identity, gender, marital status, and past residential situation do not significantly contribute to risk assessment in this context. The belief in a higher power can sometimes indicate a sense of personal responsibility, which could also contribute to lower risk. However, without conviction data or specific details about his previous arrest, it's difficult to definitively assess recidivism risk. Therefore, the confidence level is moderate.",
