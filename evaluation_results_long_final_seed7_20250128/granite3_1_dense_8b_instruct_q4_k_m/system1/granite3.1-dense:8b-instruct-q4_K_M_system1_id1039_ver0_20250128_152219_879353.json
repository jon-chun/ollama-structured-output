Age (19 years old) and gender (female) are not typically associated with high recidivism rates.\n2. She has only been arrested once, which is a lower number of prior offenses compared to higher-risk individuals.\n3. Her height and weight do not contribute significantly to risk assessment.\n4. Marital status and living arrangements (never married and currently living alone) are not strong indicators of recidivism risk.\n5. She has completed high school but is not enrolled in college, which does not indicate a significant risk factor.\n6. Lack of employment during the year may be a concern, but without additional information on her motivation or circumstances for unemployment, it's difficult to assess this as a major risk factor.\n7. Past drug use (marijuana) is less concerning than other substances and does not indicate chronic substance abuse.\n8. Not feeling depressed over the past month reduces the likelihood of mental health issues contributing to recidivism risk.\n9. Living with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents at a young age may have provided some level of stability and support.\n10. Belief in a higher power is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\n\nThe confidence score is relatively low due to the limited information available regarding employment status, substance abuse history, and criminal behavior. More detailed information on these factors would be necessary to make a more confident assessment.",
