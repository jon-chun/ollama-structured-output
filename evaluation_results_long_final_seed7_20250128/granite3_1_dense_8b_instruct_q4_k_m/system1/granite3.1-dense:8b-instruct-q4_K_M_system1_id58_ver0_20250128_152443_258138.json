    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons. The individual's age (20 years old) and gender (male) are not typically associated with high recidivism rates. His criminal history is limited to one arrest and one conviction, which suggests a lower risk compared to individuals with multiple offenses. His physical health indicators (height and weight) are within normal ranges. He has never been married and lives alone, which does not indicate any significant family or social support issues that could contribute to criminal behavior. His educational background (high school diploma but not enrolled in college) is not a strong indicator of risk. His employment history (holding two jobs during the year) suggests stability and responsibility.\n\nThe individual's past drug use (cocaine) and single parenthood are potential risk factors, but these are mitigated by his current lack of depression symptoms and positive religious beliefs. His upbringing in an urban area with both biological parents until adulthood is generally associated with lower risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some potential risk factors present, the individual's history suggests a relatively low risk for recidivism. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on the provided information and does not account for other potential mitigating or aggravating factors that could be considered in a comprehensive risk assessment.",
