However, the individual's young age, enrollment in school, and current living situation (alone) suggest a lower level of risk. The fact that she has only been arrested once, and not convicted, also lowers her risk score. Her current engagement in religious beliefs may also indicate a certain level of moral or ethical consideration which could deter from criminal behavior. Therefore, the overall prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence of 70%.",
