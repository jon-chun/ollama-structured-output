The individual's young age, lack of prior convictions, and current employment history suggest lower risk. However, the use of drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and the fact that he has lived in an urban area with a large family could potentially indicate higher risk. The absence of depression symptoms and recent religious belief may offset some of these factors. Overall, while there are some risk indicators present, they do not suggest a high level of risk.",
