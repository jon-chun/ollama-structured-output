The individual's young age (20 years old) and lack of education or college enrollment are often associated with higher risk. His history of arrest, even without a conviction, suggests involvement in criminal activity. The use of drugs, particularly cocaine, is also a significant risk factor. Feeling persistently depressed for extended periods can indicate mental health issues that may contribute to criminal behavior. Living in an urban area and growing up in a large household with a single mother are factors that have been linked to higher crime rates in statistical analyses. The individual's religious belief, while seemingly positive, does not offset the other risk factors in this case. Therefore, the prediction is YES for high risk, with a confidence level of 75%.",
