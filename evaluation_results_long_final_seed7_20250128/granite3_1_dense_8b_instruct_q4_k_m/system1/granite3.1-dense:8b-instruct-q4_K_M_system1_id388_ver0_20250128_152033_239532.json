    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe risk factors provided indicate a relatively low risk for several reasons. The individual's age (19) and gender are not typically associated with high criminal activity. His arrest history is limited, and he has not been convicted, which suggests a lack of persistence in criminal behavior. His physical attributes (height, weight) do not contribute significantly to risk assessment. He is not married and does not live alone, but these factors are less indicative of risk.\n\nHis educational background (no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college) could be a concern, as lower levels of education have been linked to higher crime rates. However, his employment history is limited (held 1 job during the year), which may indicate difficulty finding work due to lack of qualifications rather than a propensity for criminal behavior.\n\nHis substance use history is positive, as he has not used drugs in the past four years and only occasionally feels depressed. These factors suggest a stable mental health status and no involvement in drug-related crimes. His living situation (rural area, household of 4) during childhood does not significantly contribute to risk assessment.\n\nHis religious beliefs (considering God has something to do with personal events) could potentially act as a protective factor against criminal behavior, although this is less clear-cut than other factors. Overall, while some aspects of his background are concerning, the absence of persistent criminal activity, drug use, and employment instability suggests a lower risk level.\n\nIt's important to note that individual cases can vary widely, and this assessment should not be used as the sole determinant in real-world scenarios. A comprehensive evaluation would consider additional factors, such as specific offense details, criminal history, mental health evaluations, and more.",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
