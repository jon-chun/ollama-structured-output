His educational background also indicates some level of stability. However, the use of drugs in the past four years is a concerning factor. The fact that he does not attribute personal events to God or religion could potentially indicate a lack of moral or ethical constraints, which might be associated with higher risk. Despite these factors, the overall profile does not suggest a high level of risk due to the limited scope and nature of his past offenses. The confidence score is relatively low because of the complexity of risk assessment and the potential for unreported or unknown factors that could influence risk.",
