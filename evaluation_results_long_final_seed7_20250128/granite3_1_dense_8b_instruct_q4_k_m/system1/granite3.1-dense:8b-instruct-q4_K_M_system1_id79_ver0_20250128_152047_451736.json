    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe risk factors provided indicate a relatively low-risk individual. Although the individual is male and young (19 years old), he has only been arrested once without conviction, suggesting a limited criminal history. His physical attributes, marital status, and employment history are not indicative of high-risk behavior. The fact that he has not used drugs in the past four years is also a positive factor.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that feeling \"so down in the dumps\" for an extended period could potentially indicate mental health issues, which could indirectly influence risk behavior. Yet, without further information on the severity and treatment of these feelings, this factor does not significantly increase the overall risk assessment.\n\nThe individual's upbringing in an urban area with his biological mother and siblings suggests a stable family environment during his formative years, which typically mitigates against higher future risks. His religious beliefs may also play a protective role against criminal behavior.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the risk level is assessed to be low. The confidence in this prediction is moderate due to the limited data available about his mental health and other potential contributing factors.",
