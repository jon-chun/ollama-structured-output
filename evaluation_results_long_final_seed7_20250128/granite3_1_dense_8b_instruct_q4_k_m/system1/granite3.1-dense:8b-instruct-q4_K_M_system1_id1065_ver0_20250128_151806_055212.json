    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low risk for several reasons. First, the individual is young (20 years old), which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to older offenders. Second, she has been arrested but not convicted, indicating that there may be mitigating circumstances or lack of evidence in her previous cases. Third, she has never been married and is living alone, which can sometimes correlate with lower risk as these individuals have fewer social ties to the community. Fourth, she has held no jobs during the year, suggesting financial instability but not necessarily criminal behavior. Fifth, while she has used drugs in the past, there's no indication of recent substance abuse or addiction. Sixth, she does not report feeling depressed over the past month, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. Lastly, her religious beliefs may provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, potentially reducing criminal behavior. However, it's important to note that living in a household with four people at a young age could suggest exposure to complex family dynamics that might increase risk. Despite these factors, the overall profile suggests low-to-moderate risk.",
