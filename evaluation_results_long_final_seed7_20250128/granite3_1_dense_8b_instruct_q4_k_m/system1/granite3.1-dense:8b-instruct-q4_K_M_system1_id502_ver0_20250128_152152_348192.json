    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low level of risk for several reasons:\n\n1. Age and gender: Being young and female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n2. Criminal history: Only one arrest without conviction suggests a lack of persistent criminal behavior.\n3. Physical attributes: The person's height and weight range are not indicative of risk.\n4. Marital status and living arrangement: Living alone and never being married is not associated with higher risk.\n5. Education: Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college is neutral in terms of risk.\n6. Employment history: Holding multiple jobs during the year suggests stability and responsibility.\n7. Substance use: Past marijuana use does not necessarily indicate a high-risk level, especially without evidence of recent or frequent use.\n8. Mental health: Occasional feelings of sadness do not imply a severe mental health condition that would elevate risk.\n9. Family background: Living with her biological mother in a small rural household suggests a stable upbringing, which can be protective against criminal behavior.\n10. Religious beliefs: Belief in God's role in personal events is not associated with increased risk.\n\nConsidering the above factors, the overall risk level appears to be low. However, it is essential to note that this assessment is based on provided information and may not account for unmentioned factors or nuances in individual circumstances.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
