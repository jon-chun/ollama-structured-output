    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low level of risk for several reasons. The individual's age (21) and gender (male) are not inherently high-risk indicators. His arrest history, although present, is limited to one instance without conviction, which suggests less severe criminal behavior. His physical attributes (height and weight) do not correlate with increased risk. He has not experienced long-term relationships or living situations that could potentially influence risky behaviors.\n\nHis educational background (high school diploma but no college enrollment) does not indicate a high level of sophistication or planning that might be associated with higher-risk offenders. His employment history is somewhat unstable, having held only two jobs in the year, which could potentially signal financial strain rather than criminal intent.\n\nHis drug use (marijuana) is a moderate risk factor but is mitigated by his lack of depression over the past month, which suggests he may not be prone to substance abuse or addiction. His family background includes living with both parents in an urban environment during childhood, which is generally associated with lower risk.\n\nHis current living situation (alone) could potentially indicate some level of social isolation, but this factor alone does not significantly elevate his risk profile. His religious beliefs (considering God has a role in personal events) might suggest a level of moral or ethical grounding that reduces his propensity for criminal behavior.\n\nOverall, while some factors present moderate risk indicators, their combined effect is not substantial enough to classify this individual as high-risk with a high degree of confidence. This assessment could be refined with additional contextual information about his social network, criminal associates, or specific offense details.",
