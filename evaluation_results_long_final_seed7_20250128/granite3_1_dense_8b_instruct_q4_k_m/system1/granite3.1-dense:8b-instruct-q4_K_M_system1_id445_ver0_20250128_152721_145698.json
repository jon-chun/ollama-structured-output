The individual's age (18), gender, and ethnicity do not significantly contribute to risk assessment. His criminal history is limited to one arrest without conviction, suggesting he has not engaged in repeated offenses. His current enrollment in school indicates stability and responsibility. Living alone suggests independence and self-reliance. Having held 2 jobs during the year implies employability and economic stability. Past drug use does not necessarily indicate a propensity for criminal behavior, especially when considering his lack of depression and recent sobriety. His upbringing in a rural area with siblings suggests he may have developed resilience and coping skills from an early age. However, the absence of religious belief could potentially correlate with higher risk, although this is less significant than other factors considered here. The confidence level is moderate due to the limited information provided about his current situation and behavioral tendencies.",
