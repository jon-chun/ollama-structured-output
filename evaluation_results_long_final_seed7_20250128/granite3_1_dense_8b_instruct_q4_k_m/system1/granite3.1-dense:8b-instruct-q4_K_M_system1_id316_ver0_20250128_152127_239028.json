While some factors such as previous arrests, drug use, and not being married can indicate higher risk, others like his age, race, height, weight, living situation, and recent depression absence might suggest a lower risk. The fact that he has never been enrolled in college or held multiple jobs could also be indicative of less risk. However, the confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information provided and the complexity of human behavior prediction.",
