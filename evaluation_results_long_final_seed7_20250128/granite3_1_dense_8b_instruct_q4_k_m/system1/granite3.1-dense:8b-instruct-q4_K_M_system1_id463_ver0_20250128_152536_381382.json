    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided suggest a relatively low-risk individual for several reasons:\n1. Age (21): Younger individuals typically have less established patterns of criminal behavior.\n2. Gender (female): Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates than males.\n3. Arrest history: Only one arrest without a conviction indicates a limited criminal record.\n4. Employment status: Being unemployed does not inherently indicate high risk, but the lack of recent employment could suggest potential financial strain or instability.\n5. Substance use: Past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a concern, but the absence of recent use and depression symptoms mitigates this factor.\n6. Marital status: Being married can indicate social stability and support.\n7. Education level: A high school diploma suggests some level of cognitive ability and potential for positive life outcomes.\n8. Religious beliefs: Holding religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose, morality, and personal responsibility.\n9. Childhood environment: Living in an urban area with her biological father and another person suggests some level of family support and structure during formative years.\n\nHowever, the decision to predict \"NO\" with a confidence of 60% is based on a balanced consideration of these factors. The single arrest, substance use history, and unemployment are slightly concerning, but they do not outweigh the more positive aspects of her profile. Ultimately, this prediction should be used as a guide rather than a definitive assessment, as individual circumstances can vary widely.",
