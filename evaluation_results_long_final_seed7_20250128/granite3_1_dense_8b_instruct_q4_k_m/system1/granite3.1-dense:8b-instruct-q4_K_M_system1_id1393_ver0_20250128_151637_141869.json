    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n\nExplanation: The risk factors presented indicate a relatively low level of risk for several reasons. Firstly, the individual's age (20 years old) and gender (female) are generally associated with lower recidivism rates. She has only been arrested once, without conviction, which suggests limited criminal involvement. Her physical attributes (height, weight) do not present any specific risk factors. Living alone and never being married does not necessarily indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHer education level (high school diploma but not enrolled in college) is not a significant predictor of recidivism. The number of jobs held during the year (4) suggests she is employable, which can be a protective factor against reoffending. Her drug use history is limited to marijuana and does not suggest a severe substance abuse issue.\n\nHer report of feeling down at times does indicate some level of emotional distress, but the lack of ongoing treatment or recent usage suggests this may not be an immediate risk factor. Living with her biological mother in a small household in an urban area during childhood could potentially present some risks, but these are mitigated by her current living situation and employment status.\n\nFinally, her belief in a higher power could act as a positive influence, discouraging criminal behavior. Despite several potential risk factors (drug use, emotional distress), the overall pattern of low involvement in criminal activity and the absence of convictions leads to a lower risk assessment. However, it's important to note that this analysis is based on the information provided and does not account for unmentioned factors or nuances that could influence risk.",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 165 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
