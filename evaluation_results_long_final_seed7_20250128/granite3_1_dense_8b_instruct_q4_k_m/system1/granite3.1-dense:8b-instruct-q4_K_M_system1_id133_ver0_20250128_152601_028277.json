The fact that he has been arrested 4 times and convicted suggests a history of criminal behavior, indicating a higher risk. His lack of formal education (no high school diploma or GED) and employment instability (held only one job in the year) are also risk factors. Living alone, not being married, and his low weight may suggest potential vulnerabilities or health issues. The use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine), especially if they were used regularly, increases the risk significantly. Feeling persistently down for a month suggests potential mental health issues which can be associated with increased risk. His history of living with adults other than his biological parents in an urban area may indicate exposure to environmental factors that could contribute to risky behaviors or circumstances. Despite considering God has something to do with personal events, this factor does not counteract the other indicators of high risk.",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
