Criminal history (1 arrest, though not convicted)\n3. Substance use (marijuana and cocaine)\n4. Past month depression symptoms (\"so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up\")\n5. Living alone\n6. Multiple jobs during the year\n7. Urban upbringing in a large family household (size 5)\n8. Consideration of divine intervention in personal events.\n\nThese factors suggest an increased risk for recidivism and other negative outcomes, such as further criminal behavior, substance abuse issues, or mental health challenges. The high score is based on the statistical correlation between these factors and higher risk behaviors or outcomes. However, it's important to note that this prediction is probabilistic and not deterministic.",
