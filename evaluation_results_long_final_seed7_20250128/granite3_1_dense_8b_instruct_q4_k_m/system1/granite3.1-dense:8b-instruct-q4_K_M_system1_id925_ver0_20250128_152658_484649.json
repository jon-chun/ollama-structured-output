While the individual has used drugs and has a history of arrest (which could indicate a tendency towards criminal behavior), there are several mitigating factors: he is currently enrolled in school, employed, and living independently, which can indicate stability and responsibility. His lack of depression and a supportive family environment also suggest lower risk. The absence of religious beliefs does not necessarily correlate with criminal behavior. Therefore, the prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%.",
