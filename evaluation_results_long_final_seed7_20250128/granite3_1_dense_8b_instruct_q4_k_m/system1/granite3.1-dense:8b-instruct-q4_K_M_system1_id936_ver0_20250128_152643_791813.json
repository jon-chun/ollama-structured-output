    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe individual's age (21), gender, and ethnicity do not directly correlate with high risk in statistical models for recidivism. The single arrest without conviction is also not a strong indicator of high risk. The individual's physical attributes are neutral factors. Living alone and never being married are also not indicative of high risk.\n\nThe individual's educational background (GED, no current college enrollment) could potentially indicate higher risk, but the specific score on standardized tests is missing. Job instability could be a risk factor, but holding 3 jobs during the year might suggest active job searching rather than unemployment or underemployment, which are more strongly correlated with recidivism.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years is a risk factor, particularly cocaine due to its association with more serious crime and instability. However, the individual's statement of not feeling depressed over the past month might suggest lower risk associated with mental health issues.\n\nLiving in a small household at a young age could be a protective factor against high risk, as larger households are sometimes associated with higher risk due to factors like family instability or exposure to crime. The individual's religious beliefs do not directly correlate with recidivism risk in statistical models.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the prediction of high risk is not strong, hence \"NO\" with a confidence level of 65%. This confidence score reflects the uncertainty due to missing information (like test scores) and the relatively low number of arrests and criminal behaviors indicated.",
