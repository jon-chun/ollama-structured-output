First, the individual is young (18 years old), which typically correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to older offenders. He has only been arrested once and convicted, suggesting limited criminal history. His current enrollment in school indicates stability and potential for positive life changes. The absence of substance abuse issues and feelings of depression over the past month also suggests lower risk.\n\nHowever, there are some factors that could potentially indicate higher risk if they were present but are not: lack of employment during the year, living alone (which can sometimes correlate with social isolation or lack of support), and the absence of religious beliefs (though this is a complex factor and does not necessarily predict criminal behavior). Given these considerations, the confidence level in this prediction is moderate.",
