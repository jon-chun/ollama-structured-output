    "raw_message_text": "{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n\n[Explanation] The risk factors provided indicate a relatively low level of risk for several reasons:\n1. Age (20 years old) and gender (female) are generally associated with lower recidivism rates in criminal justice studies.\n2. She has only been arrested once, but not convicted, suggesting that her past involvement with the criminal justice system is minimal.\n3. Her physical characteristics (height and weight) do not indicate a propensity for violence or aggression.\n4. She has never been married and currently lives alone, which may suggest less social support and integration, potentially increasing risk, but this factor alone does not significantly contribute to high-risk status.\n5. Her educational background (high school diploma) suggests some level of stability and potential for employment opportunities.\n6. She has held one job in the past year, indicating an ability to maintain employment, which is a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n7. She has not used drugs in the past four years and has been experiencing persistent sadness, suggesting no recent substance abuse or mental health issues that could increase risk.\n8. Her upbringing in an urban area with adoptive parents might indicate a history of instability, but this factor alone does not significantly contribute to high-risk status.\n9. Her religious beliefs may act as a protective factor against criminal behavior.\n10. The confidence level is relatively low due to the limited information provided and the absence of factors typically associated with high risk (e.g., prior convictions, substance abuse, mental health issues, history of violence).",
