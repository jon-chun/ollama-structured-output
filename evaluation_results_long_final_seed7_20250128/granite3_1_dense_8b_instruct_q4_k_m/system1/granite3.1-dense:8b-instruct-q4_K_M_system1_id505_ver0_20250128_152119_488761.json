His arrest record is limited (1 time, no conviction) which also suggests lower risk. His physical attributes are average. Living alone and being unmarried do not necessarily indicate high risk. His educational background (high school diploma and college enrollment) could potentially suggest a level of social integration and future potential, reducing risk. Employment history shows some job retention, which is positive. Drug use in the past does contribute to risk, but the frequency of current negative feelings suggests possible depression rather than active substance abuse or criminal behavior. The size of his household at a young age and his lack of religious belief do not significantly increase risk in this context. Therefore, the overall risk is considered low to moderate with a confidence level of 70%.",
