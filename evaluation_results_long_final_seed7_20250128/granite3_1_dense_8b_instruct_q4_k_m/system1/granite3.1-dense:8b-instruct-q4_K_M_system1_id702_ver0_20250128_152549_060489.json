While the individual has a history of arrest (not conviction), she has never been married, lives alone, has no drug use history, and has a stable employment record. Her weight might be considered, but it's not directly related to criminal behavior risk. The fact that she has lived with both parents at a young age and considers religion as not influential in her life suggests a more stable background, although these factors alone do not guarantee low risk.\n\nThe high confidence score is relatively low due to the limited information about past criminal behavior or violent tendencies. Additionally, while she reported feeling depressed at times, there's no history of mental health treatment or diagnosis. The age (21) and gender (female) are also considered in this assessment, as studies have shown that males and older individuals tend to pose a higher risk.\n\nThis analysis is based on general statistical trends and does not constitute a prediction for an individual's future behavior. It's important to note that risk assessments should ideally incorporate more comprehensive data points for accurate predictions.",
