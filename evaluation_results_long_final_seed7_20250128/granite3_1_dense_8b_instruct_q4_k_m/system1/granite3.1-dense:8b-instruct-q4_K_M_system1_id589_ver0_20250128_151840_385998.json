However, the use of drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years and living in an urban area with a large family could potentially increase risk. The absence of religious belief might also be associated with higher risk, but this factor alone is not conclusive. Given these mixed indicators, the confidence level is set at 50%.",
