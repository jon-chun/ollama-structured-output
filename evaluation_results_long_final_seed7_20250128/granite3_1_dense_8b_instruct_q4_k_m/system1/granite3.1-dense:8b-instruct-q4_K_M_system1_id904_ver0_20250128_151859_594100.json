His age (22), gender, and race do not indicate high risk. He has only been arrested once and convicted, which is a lower number than many high-risk individuals. His physical attributes are average. Being married and living with his spouse can be a protective factor against criminal behavior. Having held two jobs during the year suggests stability. Although he has used drugs in the past four years, there is no indication of recent substance abuse or addiction. He does not report feeling depressed over the past month, which could be a risk factor if present. Living in a household of three as a child and his religious beliefs (or lack thereof) do not significantly contribute to high-risk factors. However, it's important to note that this assessment is based on limited information and should be validated with more comprehensive data for accuracy.",
