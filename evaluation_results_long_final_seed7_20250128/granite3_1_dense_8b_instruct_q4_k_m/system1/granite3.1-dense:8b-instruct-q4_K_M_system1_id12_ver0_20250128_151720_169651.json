The fact that he is currently enrolled in college and has held multiple jobs suggests stability and potential for positive change. His age, height, weight, marital status, and current living situation also do not significantly contribute to a high-risk assessment. The fact that he has never been convicted of a crime is a strong indicator against high risk. However, the recency of his drug use and the presence of depressive symptoms are notable concerns. Despite these, given the limited information on criminal behavior beyond the single arrest, the confidence in predicting high risk is low.",
