He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 270 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area.
