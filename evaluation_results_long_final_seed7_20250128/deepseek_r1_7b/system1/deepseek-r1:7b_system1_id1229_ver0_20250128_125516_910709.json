    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the given individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female from a Black background. Her race isn't directly linked to crime rates unless there are systemic issues at play, which might be more about societal context than her personal risk.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That's not a significant criminal history yet; it could be a minor infraction or a warning that she needs support. I don't think this alone indicates high risk.\n\nHer height and weight: 5 feet 5 inches, 145 lbs. This doesn't seem to directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are health issues involved, which isn't indicated here.\n\nLiving alone is common among young adults, especially those without family support. It's a neutral factor; no direct link to risk unless she's vulnerable.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This educational background can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates if she lacks support, but since she has some job experience, maybe that mitigates it.\n\nShe's worked 3 jobs during the year. Having a stable income is a positive sign against recidivism. It suggests she's self-sufficient to avoid criminal activities.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and felt down most of the time recently. Drug abuse can be a significant risk factor because it increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, which could lead to more crimes or substance-related issues.\n\nYoung age at 19\u2014while still underage, it's important to consider if she was supported during this period. If she's living on her own without resources, this might raise concerns about her ability to avoid criminal behavior.\n\nPast living situation with a household of five: This could indicate family issues or social isolation, which are risk factors because environments that don't provide emotional or financial support can lead to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHer belief in God suggests strong moral values and support system, which is protective rather than a risk factor. It's unlikely this would directly contribute to criminal behavior unless other negative influences were present.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest, lack of education, drug use, young age without proper support, and past living conditions seem to be the strongest indicators. While her belief in God is positive, the other factors point towards a higher risk. I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence because multiple risk factors are present that could influence criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived in a household of size 5. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
