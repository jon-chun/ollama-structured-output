    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. \n\nFirst, his age is 20, which is relatively young, but since he's already been arrested once without a conviction, that might be a significant factor. Being Black could imply some systemic issues, but without more info on prior convictions or discrimination incidents, it's hard to say.\n\nHe has only one arrest and no convictions, so maybe previous legal issues are limited. His height and weight don't immediately raise concerns unless there's an issue with health, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which can sometimes be a red flag if he's been experiencing instability or neglect, but again, not sure without more context on his living situation.\n\nHigh school diploma and being in college suggests some level of education, which might positively influence his behavior compared to someone with less education. He has three job experiences; stability is another positive indicator as inconsistent work can lead to drug use and other issues.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't mentioned any severe substance abuse issues recently. His mood seems down during the past month, which could be a sign of underlying mental health concerns or stressors in his life.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in an urban household might have shaped his behavior and mental state; some children can develop coping mechanisms but others may not, leading to substance use issues. Believing in God for guidance is a positive aspect as it shows he has a support system.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are some concerning points like past drug use and living circumstances, the lack of prior convictions and higher education somewhat mitigates risk. However, the downward mood and potential mental health issues might increase the risk level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\nThe factors indicate a moderate to high risk due to past substance use concerns, living circumstances, and potential underlying mental health issues. However, the lack of prior convictions and higher education levels somewhat reduce the risk compared to similar profiles with more concerning tendencies.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
