    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm supposed to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Okay, first, let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nHe has two prior arrests and a conviction. That seems like a significant criminal history, which usually points towards higher risk because of past behavior that might affect future decisions or tendencies.\n\nHis race is White, but I don't think race plays a direct role here unless it's part of some systemic issue, which doesn't seem to be indicated here. So maybe not much impact.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 160 lbs. That's average height for his age group, so he might be considered overweight? Wait, no, at 160 lbs, that's actually on the lower side for someone of his height. Maybe he's not overweight, but I'm not sure if that affects risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate higher risk because there might be less support around him, leading to potential issues like substance abuse or isolation problems.\n\nHis education level is a high school diploma without college enrollment. Maybe that's contributing to his current situation; perhaps he lacks the skills needed for better opportunities, which could lead to unstable living situations.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year, so maybe he's unemployed or underemployed. Job instability can be risky as it might affect his ability to provide for himself and manage personal finances.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning because drug use is linked to various negative outcomes like crime, health issues, and family problems. It also shows he's been involved with substances which can affect his judgment and behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, but if this is recent, maybe it's a sign of mental stability or him trying hard not to get depressed. However, past depression could be more concerning, but since it's stated as recent, perhaps less so.\n\nHis background: at a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of three in a rural area. That might suggest family support and perhaps some sheltered environment which could have its pros and cons. He also believes that God has something to do with his personal events, indicating he's religious but maybe not struggling with spirituality-related issues.\n\nPutting it all together: two prior convictions, living alone, unemployment or underemployment, recent drug use, and a possible risk of isolation given the rural background. These factors could increase the risk of involvement in further criminal behavior, substance abuse, or family issues. His age being 21 isn't that old, so he might not have much life experience yet.\n\nI think the combination suggests a high risk because of past criminal history, living alone, unemployment, and drug use despite recent control over depression. So I'd lean towards \"YES\" with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
