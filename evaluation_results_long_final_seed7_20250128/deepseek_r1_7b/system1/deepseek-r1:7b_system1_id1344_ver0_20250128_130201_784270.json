    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual described. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female Hispanic, arrested twice but not convicted. That's two arrests; in some places, that might count as criminal history, especially if she's young. But since it's not a conviction yet, maybe her risk is lower compared to someone with a full record.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and 120 lbs. Weight-wise, she's under the BMI for many people, but height could affect how she perceives her own weight. Being underweight or in a certain size category might not directly indicate risk unless there are health issues mentioned.\n\nNot married and currently not living alone\u2014she's an only child or with other family members. That doesn't inherently pose a high risk unless there are other factors like domestic violence, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, so she's actively engaged in education. Education is usually protective against recidivism, so that's positive and lowers the risk.\n\nShe has held three jobs during the year. Frequent job changes can be a sign of instability, but if they're stable roles, it might not indicate high risk. Not using drugs for four years seems like good behavior, which is a strong indicator of low risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month; mental health is a positive factor. People who manage their mental health well are less likely to engage in risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with four people\u2014 household size can influence family support and stability. Smaller households might offer more supervision or protection.\n\nShe has a belief in God's role in her life. Religious affiliation often correlates with strong moral values, which can be protective against negative behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: no prior convictions despite arrests, stable employment (3 jobs), active student status, no drug use, good mental health, and family living situation. These factors suggest she has low to moderate risk. She's actively engaged in school and managing her personal aspects well, which are positive indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
