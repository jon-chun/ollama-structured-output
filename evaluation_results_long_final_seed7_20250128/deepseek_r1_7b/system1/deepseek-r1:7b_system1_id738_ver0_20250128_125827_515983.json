    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age isn't typically a strong indicator of risk unless there's something specific about his age group, but here it's just 20. Being White doesn't inherently correlate with higher or lower risk without more context.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but not convicted. Twice is significant; recidivism rates can vary, but since he hasn't been convicted yet, that might indicate some effort to change. However, arrest frequency alone isn't enough to determine high risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 5 feet 11 inches and 140 lbs. No direct correlation with criminal risk based on these physical attributes.\n\nHe's never married and currently not living alone. Unmarried individuals can sometimes be more independent unless there are underlying issues, but this factor alone isn't strong evidence of high risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is often linked to recidivism; those without education might have higher chances of engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can contribute to stability, which might reduce recidivism risk. But sometimes job instability can be a factor too.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive and shows self-control, which could lower risk perception.\n\nFeeling down for much of the month suggests possible mental health issues or substance abuse problems. It's concerning but not without context about treatment.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. Extended family living can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to potential neglect or lack of supervision, especially in rural areas where supervision might be less accessible.\n\nBelieving in God shows some level of spirituality, which is generally protective against criminal behavior but doesn't negate other risk factors.\n\nConsidering all these, the most significant negative factor seems to be living with an extended family in a rural area. The other factors are mixed; lack of education and past arrests could be mitigated if addressed properly. However, the living situation does present a notable risk indicator.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
