    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male from a White background. I'm not sure how race factors into risk assessment here, but generally, it might be considered as a minor factor compared to other indicators.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because prior convictions are typically strong predictors of recidivism. So that already points towards high risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 2 inches and 170 lbs. I don't think height or weight alone indicate much without additional context, but maybe combined with other factors like his current situation could matter.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a sign of instability or lack of support, which might increase the risk of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing higher education can be linked to lower self-esteem and increased likelihood of substance use or criminal behavior.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having a steady job could indicate responsibility and stability, which might actually reduce risk, but it also depends on what kind of work he does.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Even if it's not severe, drug use is often linked to other risky behaviors or mental health issues like depression.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. If he doesn't experience depression, that might suggest better mental health, which could mitigate some risk factors. But I should consider his history too; maybe he had depression before?\n\nHis background: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. That's an unusual and challenging family environment, which can lead to various behavioral issues.\n\nLastly, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support or guidance, which might be associated with higher risk of certain behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and conviction are major red flags. Drug use adds another layer. His living situation is challenging. He's never married and living alone, which can contribute to instability. Without formal education and holding two jobs isn't a strong point for stability but might not be enough on its own. The lack of religious support could also influence his behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like he does present high risk. I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
