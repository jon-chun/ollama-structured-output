    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the person described. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male Hispanic, arrested twice but not convicted. His lack of convictions might mean fewer negative impacts on his record, which could be lower risk. However, being young and having only two arrests isn't immediately alarming.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 170 lbs \u2013 nothing jumps out as physically concerning here. Weight-wise, that's a common figure, so probably not a red flag.\n\nLiving alone is standard; most people do that now, so no issue there. No family ties beyond his current living situation in an urban area from a young age might suggest some instability or neglect? Or maybe he's been in environments where he was safe with both parents present for a long time.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college \u2013 this could mean limited opportunities, which is a negative. Plus, not being educated can lead to poorer job prospects and higher risk of poverty.\n\nHe has one job but hasn't used marijuana in the past four years and feels no depression recently. His substance use history is clean now, so that's positive.\n\nHis belief in God might indicate a lack of faith or spirituality, which some people associate with lower motivation towards positive behavior, but it doesn't directly tie to risk unless he's involved in risky activities.\n\nPutting this together: While there are some negative factors like past arrests and educational gaps, the positives like clean substance use and single job offer some balance. The young age might reduce immediate risk as he could still make good choices.\n\nSo overall, I'd say it's a moderate risk with low confidence because of his youth and positive attributes offsetting some negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
