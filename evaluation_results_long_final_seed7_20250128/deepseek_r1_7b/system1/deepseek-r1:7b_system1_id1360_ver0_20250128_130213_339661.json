She's been arrested twice but not convicted, which might indicate past behavior issues without consequences. Her height is 5'7\", which isn't immediately concerning. She's single and living alone, maybe socially isolated.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college, showing minimal educational engagement. No job experience suggests she might be unemployed or underemployed, which can sometimes correlate with substance use issues.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That's interesting; perhaps her drug use doesn't align with current mental health issues, though it's not uncommon to have substance abuse without concurrent depression.\n\nHer background shows she lived with her biological mother at age 2 and she has a religious belief in God affecting her personal life. This might suggest she has some coping mechanisms or support systems.\n\nConsidering all these factors: past minor offenses (2 arrests), lack of education, unemployment status, drug use, and living alone, but no recent mental health issues like depression. It's possible she could face higher risk for future substance abuse or criminal behavior despite not being convicted yet.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
