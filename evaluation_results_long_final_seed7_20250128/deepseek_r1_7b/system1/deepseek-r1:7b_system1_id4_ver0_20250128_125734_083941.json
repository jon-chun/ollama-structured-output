    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. He's been arrested once but not convicted. His height is 5'6\" and he weighs 140 lbs. He's single and living alone without a high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. He's worked three jobs this year.\n\nHe has drug use history, particularly marijuana over the past four years. In the last month, he feels very low most of the time with noone to cheer him up. At 14, he lived with four people, which might indicate family instability or a challenging upbringing. He doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life.\n\nI need to assess these factors for risk. His age is quite young, and while that can be both protective and risk-inducing depending on circumstances. Being Hispanic may have some social factors at play but without more context, it's hard to gauge impact.\n\nArrests are a negative factor, even if not convicted. Unemployed or underemployed with job history might mean he's relying on others for support, which can be risky. His low education level could lead him down risky paths.\n\nDrug use is significant; even occasional use can have negative consequences. Feeling down most of the time suggests possible mental health issues. Living at 14 in a household of four could indicate family dysfunction or neglect, which might influence his current behavior and future decisions.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might affect his motivation towards positive actions but doesn't directly correlate with high risk unless it affects his ability to seek help.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while some are mitigating (age, living situation), the presence of drug use, lack of education, and emotional distress are strong indicators of a high risk. Therefore, I'd rate this as high risk with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
