    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested three times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; that usually is a red flag in risk assessments because it shows criminal history which can impact his ability to commit new crimes.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 180 lbs. I don't know if that gives me any direct info about risk, but maybe combined with other factors like weight or build, but here alone, perhaps not much.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Single status can sometimes be a protective factor because he might have fewer social networks to turn to for support, which could make him more vulnerable. But it depends on the context.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not having a higher education might mean less stability or opportunities that come with formal education. Maybe related to substance use or employment issues?\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. That seems manageable; having multiple jobs can provide income and reduce dependency on substances, but it could also indicate he's stable enough not to need much supervision.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is positive. Drug abuse is a major risk factor for reoffending because it disrupts life and increases vulnerability.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in a month. That's good; depression can be a motivator for criminal behavior if not addressed properly.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in a household of six at a young age. That suggests he might have experienced abuse or neglect, which is a serious risk factor associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe believes in God and feels connected to his faith. While religious beliefs can influence behavior, they also provide support systems that could mitigate some risks if properly integrated into his life.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions, living alone (which might mean less support), no drug use, but past living arrangements with non-biological family which could imply abuse. The lack of education and employment despite being employed for three jobs isn't enough to outweigh the risk factors related to prior criminal history and possible exposure to adverse childhood experiences.\n\nI think these factors together indicate a high risk because of the prior convictions, living situation, and possible association with harmful family dynamics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
