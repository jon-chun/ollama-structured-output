    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's an 18-year-old male from White ethnicity. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That alone doesn't seem super concerning because he didn't get a conviction, so maybe the legal issues aren't severe yet. He weighs 230 lbs at 5'9\", which is quite heavy. Weight can sometimes be associated with substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone without a support system might increase stress or isolation, but I'm not sure how that translates to high risk immediately. Maybe if there are underlying issues like mental health problems.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not having a degree could mean he's less likely to get job training, which might lead to unemployment or other unstable situations. Unemployment can be a risk factor for various issues.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Only one job suggests that maybe he's not seeking more opportunities, but it doesn't necessarily indicate poor performance at his current job unless there are other signs of instability.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana specifically) could be linked to mental health issues or substance abuse problems. Past drug use can sometimes lead to more volatile behavior or legal issues beyond just the initial arrest.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign. No recent mental health indicators here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of size 2 with non-biological parents in a rural area. That could mean living in an environment without supervision or support, potentially leading to behavioral issues later on.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal outcomes. This religious belief might influence his behavior; however, it's not necessarily a direct risk factor unless there are instances of risky behavior tied to his faith.\n\nPutting this all together: The main factors that stand out are past drug use (which could lead to substance abuse issues) and living in an unstable household with non-parental care. His lack of degree might affect job prospects, but without evidence of unemployment or related issues, it's not a strong indicator here.\n\nConsidering these points, I think the risk is moderate. He has some potential areas that could be problematic if not addressed, so assigning a confidence level around 65% seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. **Arrest History**: Single non-convicted arrest is noted but doesn't indicate severe legal issues.\n2. **Weight**: Heaviness could imply potential health risks or substance abuse, which might be a risk factor.\n3. **Living Situation**: Living alone in a rural area with non-biological parents may contribute to isolation and behavioral issues.\n4. **Drug Use**: Past marijuana use is noted; substance abuse can lead to higher risk of instability.\n5. **Mental Health**: No recent signs of depression, which is positive but doesn't negate past drug use as a risk factor.\n6. **Education**: GED indicates limited educational opportunities or future prospects if not pursued further.\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall risk assessment leans towards moderate high risk with a confidence level of 65%.",
