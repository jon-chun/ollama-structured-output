    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male aged 20, arrested eight times and convicted. That's a lot of prior convictions; they often show a history of criminal behavior which can be a red flag. Age-wise, being 20 might mean he's still developing his decision-making skills, but multiple arrests could indicate instability.\n\nHe's tall at 7 feet 8 inches and weighs 160 lbs. While this isn't directly a risk factor, weight is context-dependent; however, combined with other factors like drug use, it might be relevant.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014living situation can influence behavior. Being unattached sometimes correlates with higher risk-taking behaviors or substance abuse.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education gaps often correlate with unstable lives, higher crime rates, and possibly lower self-esteem, all of which could contribute to risky behavior.\n\nHe's employed two jobs in the past year\u2014some work experience might indicate he can support himself, but it's on the lower end; maybe limited income could be a risk factor if that income isn't stable or sufficient for other expenses.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood affecting his current job or living situation. Drug use is a direct indicator of potential substance abuse problems, which can lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. High family size could indicate lack of supervision and potential for domestic issues, which are known risk factors.\n\nConsidering that God plays a role in his life\u2014this might relate to religion and spirituality influencing behavior; sometimes these factors can be protective or if involved in positive activities, but it's context-dependent without more info on how he uses this belief.\n\nPutting all together: multiple prior convictions (8), drug use, living alone with no support network, low education\u2014all point towards high risk. The tall weight might not add much here. His young age could be a mitigating factor, but considering the other elements, I'd still lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
