    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 18 might be considered at risk because it's a minor age, but without more context on his criminal history or behavior, I can't conclude that yet.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which could indicate past behavior issues.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and he weighs between 175-199 lbs. This might not directly relate to risk unless combined with other factors like behavior or health issues.\n\nHe hasn't been married and isn't currently living alone. Living situation can sometimes be an indicator of stability, but I don't see a direct link here.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school could be associated with future criminal tendencies.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having worked before might indicate some level of responsibility or prior positive behavior.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's linked to other negative behaviors like theft or violence.\n\nHe doesn't feel connected to God. This could relate to religious coping mechanisms, which might influence his decision-making or behavior in risky situations.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Living with multiple family members at such a young age could indicate potential issues like neglect or abuse if not properly addressed.\n\nHe believes God has no bearing on his personal life. This lack of religious support might make him more susceptible to external pressures or have less emotional support, which can contribute to risk-taking behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: One prior arrest and drug use are significant red flags. The living situation with multiple family members could be a concern if there's neglect, but without specific issues mentioned, I'm leaning towards moderate risk. His lack of religious affiliation might not directly correlate unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or unstable living conditions.\n\nConsidering all these points, his risk level is moderately high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
