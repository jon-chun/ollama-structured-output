    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female of White descent. Age-wise, she's young, which might be a mitigating factor since younger individuals often have fewer life experiences and may not hold onto grudges as strongly. However, her arrest record shows only one incident without a conviction, so that's something to consider but probably not highly concerning.\n\nShe weighs 5'3\" and is 185 lbs. That gives me an approximate BMI, which for someone of her height might be around the lower end of normal weight. I'm not sure how this affects risk assessment unless there's a connection between weight and behavior, which isn't something I recall being significant.\n\nMarital status: She's married to her spouse. Marital stability is generally associated with lower recidivism rates because it provides support and can lead to better decision-making in case of issues. So that might not be a high risk indicator.\n\nEducation level: She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's also possible she's motivated to change her situation through other means.\n\nOccupation: She hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment for extended periods is often linked to higher recidivism rates because it can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to using marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially if recent, might be a red flag as she could still be susceptible to triggers. However, not feeling depressed now doesn't necessarily mean she's not struggling mentally.\n\nReligious involvement: She believes God is involved in her life. Religious involvement can sometimes provide moral guidance and support, which may reduce risk behaviors compared to those who don't have such strong spiritual backing.\n\nLiving situation: At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. This could indicate family stress or exposure to environments that might influence behavior, but without more context on the nature of the issues at home, it's hard to gauge the impact.\n\nPutting this all together, while there are some risk factors like lack of education and no job, the majority of her factors seem mitigating. She has a stable living situation (living with biological parents), she's young, which might reduce prior negative influences, and her religious involvement could be providing support. The fact that she hasn't felt depressed recently but used marijuana in the past four years is something to consider; however, it's not immediately clear if this use will lead to increased risk.\n\nI think the overall risk here isn't extremely high because most of the factors lean toward lower risk. However, there are enough concerning points\u2014like past drug use and no job\u2014that might still warrant some level of concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
