    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So, I need to assess the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate a high risk. The person is a 21-year-old male Hispanic, arrested once and convicted. He weighs 165 lbs, single living alone, has a high school diploma, not in college, worked one job recently. Drug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially the last month he felt really down. Young age, lived with both parents at his young age in a household of five rural area, considers God involved.\n\nFirst, his criminal history is just once, so that's not too bad. But he was convicted, which might indicate some underlying issues. He's single living alone; maybe unstable living situation? Age 21 suggests he's still developing socially and emotionally. High school diploma but not college\u2014could be a risk if he's not getting better education or has other issues.\n\nDrug use is significant here. Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially in the last month when he felt really down\u2014it shows substance abuse which can lead to various problems like addiction, mental health issues, and possibly antisocial behavior. Feeling down for a long time could indicate depression or stressors in his life.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in a household of five in a rural area might have provided a lot of support but could also mean he's had a lot of people around him who could help him through tough times, like the feeling of being down. But considering the rural setting, maybe there's less access to resources or support networks.\n\nConsidering all this: one arrest, but other factors point towards possible issues with mental health and substance use. His age might mean he hasn't had much life experience yet, which could be a risk factor for making poor decisions or being unstable in certain situations.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk is moderate to high because of the drug use and the potential impact on his mental well-being.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
