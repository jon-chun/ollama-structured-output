    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to analyze this risk factor step by step. So, we have a 22-year-old male who is White. He's been arrested twice and convicted. That\u2019s two prior convictions, which already seems significant because convictions are a strong indicator of past behavior that could impact future decisions.\n\nHe's described as having medium height at 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 145 lbs. Not sure how much this affects risk assessment, but maybe weight could relate to other factors like substance use, but it's not directly indicated here.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because there are fewer people who might support or influence him, but it also depends on the circumstances around his living situation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can correlate with lower recidivism rates if he's more likely to gain employment skills, but not everyone follows that path. Not being in school could mean he's facing other challenges or maybe looking for work.\n\nHe\u2019s held one job during the year. Having a job might indicate some stability, but it also depends on how well he managed it and if it provided benefits like health insurance or support networks.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a major red flag because substance abuse can impair judgment, decision-making, and relationships. It's often linked to higher recidivism rates as drugs can lead to more impulsive behavior or unsafe situations.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That\u2019s interesting. While depression can sometimes be a result of substance use, not feeling depressed might suggest he's managing his substances better or maybe has other coping mechanisms. However, it's also possible that he's not seeking help for mental health issues, which could be concerning.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of five in an urban area. That\u2019s a larger family size and living in an urban setting can have various implications on behavior. It might suggest more exposure to certain influences or environments that could impact his risk factors further. However, the number of people in the household isn't directly tied to risk unless we consider family dynamics.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could be a belief in determinism or atheism, which some argue might affect decision-making and self-efficacy. However, without more context on how this belief impacts his actions, it's hard to quantify its effect on risk.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior convictions are a big point towards high risk. Drug use is another significant factor that increases the likelihood of future issues. Even though he has a job and isn't married, those factors alone don't outweigh the other indicators. The presence of a prior offense history makes me lean toward high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
