    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on their criminal justice context. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and race can be indicators of risk, but without more data, it's hard to say definitively. However, being young might mean higher recidivism rates, which could indicate higher risk.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. Prior convictions are typically associated with higher risk of reoffending, so this is a significant red flag pointing towards high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches and he weighs 260 lbs. Weight can sometimes be an indicator of substance abuse or criminal behavior if it's significantly above average for his height, but there's not enough info on how that relates here. However, he has a history of drug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine), which is another serious risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living arrangements can sometimes correlate with substance abuse or unstable family environments, which might contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates when he's completing education, so not being enrolled could indicate a higher risk of reoffending if he's tempted by other opportunities.\n\nHe's held five jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can be positive as it shows adaptability and work ethic, but if he was laid off or not stable, that might suggest issues with substance abuse or unstable personal circumstances, which could relate to higher risk.\n\nMost of the time in the past month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This indicates a high level of emotional distress, which can be a strong indicator of potential self-harm or suicidal thoughts, both of which are serious concerns for risk assessment.\n\nAt a young age (19), he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Younger age and living in such circumstances might suggest exposure to family dynamics that could impact his behavior, possibly increasing risk factors.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it has something to do with his personal events. While belief in a higher power can sometimes be protective against certain types of abuse or stressors, it's not always the case, so it's a bit conflicting but not necessarily a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, emotional distress, living situation, and relatively low educational attainment. These factors point towards a high risk level. The confidence in this assessment would be quite high because of the significant number of indicators that are strongly associated with recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
