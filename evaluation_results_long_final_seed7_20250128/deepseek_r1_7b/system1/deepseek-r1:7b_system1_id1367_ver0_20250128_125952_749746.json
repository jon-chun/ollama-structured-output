    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might have fewer life experiences that could contribute to criminal behavior. Being Black is a protected class, but without more context, it's hard to say if this alone increases risk.\n\nHe has been arrested 5 times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which usually indicates higher risk as each arrest can lead to more supervision or criminal activity again.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 230 lbs. While weight can be an indicator in some cases, without knowing his body fat percentage or other health metrics, it's not very meaningful on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living situations can influence behavior, but unless there are signs of instability or neglect, this might not directly correlate with high risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates when higher education is available as an escape route. Not having a degree could increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Employment stability can reduce stress, but holding even one job might be enough for someone with other issues. However, not working full-time or having recent unemployment could be concerning.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential for more risky behavior, including substance abuse which can lead to further legal issues or violence.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of mood issues might suggest some level of emotional stability, but this could vary widely based on other factors like his support system.\n\nAt 19, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Living in such a setting can sometimes provide a sense of security or neglect if there are issues at home, which might influence behavior.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal experiences. This religious belief could either provide guidance or create pressure to conform, but without knowing the specifics, it's hard to assess its impact on risk.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions, lack of education, unemployment history, drug use, and living situation issues all point towards a high risk. The factors don't seem to balance out with positive influences that would lower the risk. Therefore, I'd lean towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
