    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on her circumstances as a 20-year-old female. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. That might suggest some prior trouble, but since there are no convictions, it doesn't directly point towards criminal behavior. However, arrest history can sometimes be a red flag for more serious issues.\n\nShe identifies as White, which I know isn't inherently linked to risk unless we're considering systemic issues or stereotypes, which I shouldn't assume here.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5'5\" and 120 lbs. That's on the lighter side, but not necessarily indicative of high risk without context about body type relative to her job or lifestyle.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Maybe she has a partner, which could be a positive factor in terms of support system, reducing risk factors related to isolation.\n\nHigh school diploma with no college enrollment. While education can correlate with lower recidivism rates, it's not directly linked to high risk if she's not seeking help or engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nNo job during the year. Unemployment can contribute to stress and potentially risky decisions, but again, without knowing her mental health or other resources, it's hard to gauge the impact.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't necessarily a criminal offense unless it leads to substance abuse issues, which could affect her ability to function or maintain relationships. Importantly, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate some coping mechanisms.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area at a young age. This suggests she has support from family and living in a stable environment, which is generally protective against many risks.\n\nBelieving in God as part of her spirituality. A strong religious affiliation can provide moral guidance and reduce stress, contributing to lower risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: no prior convictions, stable living situation, no current employment or drug use leading to depression. The only negative point is past arrest history, but without conviction. So, the overall risk seems low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
