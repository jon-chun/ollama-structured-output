    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to figure out if I should give this person a \"YES\" or \"NO\" for high risk based on the given risk factors. Hmm, so the person is a 19-year-old male who's White. He's been arrested twice but not convicted yet. That might be a red flag because even though he hasn't gotten a conviction, it still shows some trouble.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 170 lbs, which doesn't immediately strike me as problematic in terms of physical characteristics. He's living alone, which could mean he's responsible or maybe he just prefers that kind of environment. He has no high school diploma or GED and isn't in college, so he might be facing educational challenges.\n\nHe only held one job during the year, which is okay; having a steady job can help prevent unemployment issues. He hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a good sign. However, some of the time in the past month he felt really down and couldn't find anything to cheer him up. That could indicate depression or some other mental health issues.\n\nAt a young age, living with three people might have had an impact on his behavior or self-esteem. He believes God has something to do with his personal events, which suggests he's in a place of spiritual support but maybe not addressing deeper issues like substance abuse or behavioral problems.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: two arrests, no conviction (which could be seen as inconsistent), living alone, educational and employment challenges, some mental health issues. I think the main concerns here are the past arrests, which might indicate prior trouble that could affect his ability to function in society, and the possible signs of depression or low self-esteem.\n\nI'm not sure if two arrests without a conviction is enough to label someone as high risk. Maybe it's more about the context\u2014like whether he's actively involved in criminal activity again now. But since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe there's less immediate recidivism risk compared to someone who has a fullConviction history.\n\nThe depression symptoms could be a contributing factor towards future issues or substance abuse. He also lacks education and isn't in college, which might limit his opportunities but doesn't directly point to criminal behavior unless he's facing some kind of personal trouble now.\n\nOverall, considering the factors: two minor convictions without a full conviction, low educational attainment, possible mental health issues, living alone, no drug use, but some negative emotional state. I think there's moderate risk here because of the potential for future behavioral issues or substance use problems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\nThe prediction is set to \"YES\" with a confidence level of 65% based on factors such as past arrests, educational challenges, and possible mental health indicators.",
