    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old Black female. Let's go through each point.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate prior legal issues which could suggest some underlying problems. \n\nShe weighs 5'3\" and is between 200-224 lbs. That\u2019s on the higher end of normal weight, but it doesn't immediately point to criminal risk unless there are health complications.\n\nNot being married or living alone \u2013 maybe she's going through something personal, which could affect her mental health.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe she's dealing with job instability or lack of education causing stress.\n\nShe\u2019s employed two jobs, so she likely has some income stability but maybe not enough to meet other needs like housing or healthcare.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana before, especially recently. Drug use can affect judgment and behavior. Also, recent drug use could lead to impulsive actions.\n\nHer mood is really low for a month \u2013 that's concerning. Persistent negative emotions might point towards mental health issues affecting her ability to function normally.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with her biological mother suggests she was raised by siblings, which can sometimes be stressful but may not directly correlate to criminal behavior unless there are family dynamics issues.\n\nHer belief in God could indicate her mental state; some spirituality might help, but it's hard to link that directly to risk without more info.\n\nConsidering all these factors: past legal arrest, recent drug use, low mood \u2013 these seem to be red flags. The presence of a high school diploma and living alone might suggest she has personal issues affecting her behavior or decision-making. \n\nI think the combination suggests some risk, maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
