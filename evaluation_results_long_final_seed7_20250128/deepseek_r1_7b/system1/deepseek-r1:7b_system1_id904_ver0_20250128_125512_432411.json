    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 22 might be considered at risk because it\u2019s early in their adult life, so they still have time to make positive changes. Being White isn't inherently high risk; it's more about personal circumstances and systemic factors.\n\nHe has one arrest and a prior conviction. One offense is concerning, but since he's not repeated, maybe it's a minor charge. Prior convictions can be mitigating if it\u2019s the first offense or if he\u2019s completed probation successfully.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to risk assessment unless there are health concerns, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stability in a relationship is usually protective against recidivism, so this might lower the risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn\u2019t enrolled in college. Not completing high school can be a negative factor because education is often linked to better opportunities. However, he\u2019s not in college now, which could indicate he's motivated to get an associate degree or further education.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive as it shows employability and responsibility. Joblessness might increase risk if he struggles with finding stable employment.\n\nDrug use: He used cocaine in the past four years but hasn\u2019t felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a red flag, especially if there's associated behavior like feeling low or withdrawn. However, since he\u2019s not depressed now, maybe he's managed it well enough to stay employed and maintain relationships.\n\nHe feels no connection with God personally. Beliefs can influence risk-taking behaviors. Without religious support, he might rely on other factors for motivation or cope mechanisms, which could be both positive (if he has strong secular values) and negative if it leads to self-destructive behavior.\n\nConsidering all these, the presence of a prior conviction and drug use points towards some risk, but other mitigating factors like being married and having two jobs might balance that out. The lack of college education is a moderate red flag, but since he's actively working, maybe he\u2019s proactive about improving his situation.\n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards \"NO\" with lower confidence because there are positive signs that could reduce risk despite some negative factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
