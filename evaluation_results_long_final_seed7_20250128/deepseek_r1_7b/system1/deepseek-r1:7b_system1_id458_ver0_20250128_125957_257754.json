    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female from Hispanic heritage. She's been arrested three times but not convicted. That could be significant because being arrested multiple times without a conviction might suggest ongoing issues with law enforcement or perhaps substance abuse. But since there are no convictions yet, it might not be as concerning yet.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs 155 lbs. Her height and weight don't immediately indicate risk factors like being overweight, which sometimes is associated with higher risks in certain contexts, but without more context, I can't say for sure.\n\nShe's divorced and living alone. Living alone after divorce could be a red flag as it might signal instability or potential issues with mental health or substance use.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing high school or not pursuing further education can sometimes correlate with lower employability, which might lead to more substance abuse or lack of support networks.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year. Having a brief employment history could indicate unstable financial situation, which might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential high risk because it can lead to various negative outcomes like criminal behavior, mental health issues, etc.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While not experiencing depression isn't directly related, combined with drug use, could still be concerning if there are underlying mental health issues that aren't being acknowledged.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living with multiple family members might indicate potential family dysfunction or lack of support, which can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nShe believes in God's role in her life. This is more of a personal belief aspect rather than a risk factor, but sometimes religious beliefs can influence behavior indirectly.\n\nPutting all this together, the drug use (marijuana and cocaine) stands out as a significant red flag. Additionally, multiple arrests without convictions could imply ongoing issues with substance abuse or legal system engagement, which are tied to higher risk behaviors. Living alone after divorce might also indicate instability, possibly due to substance abuse. The lack of college enrollment combined with only one job might suggest financial instability, which can contribute to risky choices.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, especially the drug use and potential underlying issues from her past, it's reasonable to assess a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
