    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age might not be directly indicative of risk unless it's significantly above or below average for recidivism rates, but at 19, it's still early in life and might not show much risk yet.\n\nHe has been arrested nine times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions usually mean unsolved mysteries; maybe he's facing multiple charges that haven't panned out. This could indicate past issues with the system or perhaps not getting the needed support for full criminal responsibility.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 3 inches, which I don't think relates to risk unless it affects his job opportunities or something else, but there's no info on that here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might increase stress or substance use, especially if he's feeling down, as mentioned next.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can influence opportunities and support systems. Not being enrolled might mean limited resources for getting help or job training.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness is linked to higher recidivism rates because it reduces financial stability and access to support services.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but he felt down for part of the month. Drug use can sometimes correlate with mental health issues; not using could be a sign of good mental health or abstinence. However, feelings of low mood might suggest underlying issues that aren't addressed.\n\nConsidering his living situation at a young age: he lived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. That's a significant family environment which could have had both positive and negative influences. Urban areas can offer more opportunities but also stressors, especially if he wasn't supported enough by the system.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. This is a strong indicator that he might seek spiritual support or find meaning in his actions, which can aid in making better choices and reducing recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple unsolved arrests could mean unstable connections with the court or community; living alone without a stable environment increases isolation and stress; lack of job experience ties into financial instability; not using drugs but feeling down might hint at mental health issues that aren't being addressed; growing up in a large family suggests possible neglect or lack of support, which can contribute to risky behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, they seem to indicate moderate to high risk. I would give this person a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence level around 65%. That's not extremely high but definitely on the higher side considering multiple risk indicators are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
