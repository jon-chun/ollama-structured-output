    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. I'll go through each point one by one and assess their impact.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male of White ethnicity. That might not be directly predictive but could influence other factors like social support or community ties. Since he's quite young, maybe around the time when substance abuse is more common, especially since he admitted to using marijuana in the past four years and felt really low recently.\n\nHe has a criminal history\u2014two arrests and a conviction. That's a red flag right there because prior convictions are strongly associated with recidivism. It shows that he has struggled with the system before, which could mean more difficulties now.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 225-249 lbs. That's a pretty hefty build. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education can play a role in job opportunities and social stability, so not having it could limit his earning potential and contribute to dependency issues.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse, which is a stable living situation. That might indicate good support, but if other factors are negative, this alone won't determine the risk.\n\nThree jobs during the year\u2014maybe he's working multiple roles for stability or struggling financially. If it's inconsistent work, maybe it affects his focus or mental health.\n\nDrug use in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood could indicate substance abuse issues. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for various behaviors that can escalate into more serious problems, like self-harm or violence.\n\nLiving at a young age with five people\u2014could suggest living in a household where he might not have had much control over his environment. This could lead to emotional neglect or instability, which are linked to higher risk of behavioral issues.\n\nBelieving that God has nothing to do with his personal life\u2014that can increase his sense of hopelessness and despair, both of which are bad predictors for good outcomes in mental health contexts.\n\nPutting this all together: prior convictions (high), lack of education (could lead to lower earning potential, maybe more dependency on support systems if they're unstable). Drug use and mood issues point towards possible substance abuse or mental health problems. A young age with a large household might mean he's not getting the attention or support he needs. His spirituality belief is negative but could correlate with higher levels of emotional distress.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like this person has multiple indicators that suggest a high risk. The number of prior convictions alone is significant. The lack of education and current employment status don't necessarily mitigate this; in fact, they might indicate more struggle which can be a risk factor. Drug use and mood issues add to the mental health complications, which are also risk factors.\n\nSo, weighing all these points together, I think it's reasonable to categorize this as high risk with perhaps 85% confidence because several strong indicators point towards a high probability of reoffending or experiencing other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
