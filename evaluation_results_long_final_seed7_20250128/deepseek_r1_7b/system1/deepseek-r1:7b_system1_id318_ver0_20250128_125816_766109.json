    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female from Asian/Pacific Islander descent. That doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of crime risk, but it's good to note for context later.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction might suggest some past behavior that didn't lead to legal consequences. I wonder if this is a new offense or just one incident.\n\nHer height and weight aren't directly relevant here. She's 5'2\" and 145 lbs, which isn't particularly concerning in terms of risk factors related to behavior.\n\nShe's living alone, not married. Living alone can sometimes correlate with lower involvement in law enforcement but might also indicate some underlying issues affecting her mental state.\n\nShe's enrolled in school now. Educational pursuits are usually protective against recidivism, so that's a positive sign.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Having multiple job experiences suggests stability and ability to support herself, which is good for risk assessment.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some recent drug use can be concerning as substance abuse often correlates with higher risk of criminal behavior or relapse.\n\nShe felt very down during the past month, so much that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates possible mental health issues, which are significant risk factors because untreated mental health problems can lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of three in an urban area. Family living conditions early on might influence her behavior and mental state, especially if she's experiencing family dynamics that could contribute to stress or substance abuse.\n\nShe mentions considering God as part of her life, which is generally protective but can also vary based on how deeply it influences her personal decisions.\n\nPutting all this together: one arrest, no conviction, which is not a strong warning. Drug use and mental health issues are concerning, especially if they're recent and might be related to self-harm or risky behavior. The fact that she's in school and has multiple jobs suggests she's actively engaged and looking for positive outcomes.\n\nThe factors pointing towards high risk would include the drug use and mental health issues because they can lead to negative behaviors. However, her educational status and employment history are protective. She's an Asian/Pacific Islander, which sometimes is associated with lower recidivism rates but isn't always a guarantee.\n\nConsidering all these points, I'm leaning towards high risk due to the drug use and mental health indicators. The other factors don't necessarily mitigate this risk enough.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
