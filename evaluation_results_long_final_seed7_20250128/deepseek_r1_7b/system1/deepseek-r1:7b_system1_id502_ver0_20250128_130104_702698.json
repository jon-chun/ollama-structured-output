    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze these risk factors step by step. First, the person is a 20-year-old female who's White. She's been arrested once but not convicted yet, so no active criminal record. Her height and weight might be relevant if there are health concerns, but she seems within a normal range.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which could indicate some level of independence but doesn't immediately point to risk unless combined with other factors. She has a high school diploma and isn't in college, so maybe she's seeking further education or hasn't found a stable job yet. She's worked two jobs during the year, showing some work experience, though not necessarily positive.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana use over four years, which could be concerning but perhaps not heavily. The past month feeling down might indicate low mood, possibly from stress, substance abuse, or other factors. Being in a household of two at a young age and living in a rural area suggests she may have had less exposure to stimulating environments or social support.\n\nHer religious belief is noted; she feels God has an influence on her life. This might relate to mental health but doesn't directly point to substance abuse unless there's more info.\n\nCombining these, she has no active criminal history, seems socially aware (living alone), moderate education and employment history, and some signs of stress or low mood. The lack of conviction and being White might not inherently indicate high risk without further context on mental health or other factors like family dynamics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
