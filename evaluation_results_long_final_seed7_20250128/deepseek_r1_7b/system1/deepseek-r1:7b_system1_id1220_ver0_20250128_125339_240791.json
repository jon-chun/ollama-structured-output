    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for someone based on their description. Let me go through each factor one by one and think about how they might contribute to risk.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Race can be a factor in some predictive models because of systemic issues, but I also need to consider other factors here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions are often considered expungable records if they're from before the legal system changed much, so maybe that doesn't add much risk unless there are other issues.\n\nHe's 6 feet 6 inches and weighs 195 lbs. That's quite tall and heavy; perhaps he has a higher body mass index (BMI). A high BMI can be associated with higher risk for certain health conditions which might contribute to criminal behavior, like substance abuse or mental health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors out of necessity or frustration.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school at the present moment. Being in school might indicate that he's focused on education rather than criminal activities, so maybe this is a protective factor.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having a job suggests some stability and financial independence, which could reduce the need to engage in illegal activities.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a sign of underlying issues like mental health problems or substance abuse, which are risk factors for further criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Living in a large family in an urban setting might have different social dynamics and could potentially expose him to various influences that might not be positive.\n\nHe considers God to be involved in his personal life. A strong religious affiliation can sometimes provide a sense of purpose, which might help avoid certain risky behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: three arrests, potential health issues from high weight, living alone, job history, drug use, and family background. The lack of convictions means the immediate legal risk is lower, but other factors like weight, isolation, substance use, and family environment could increase the risk level.\n\nI think the overall probability leans towards a high risk with an 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
