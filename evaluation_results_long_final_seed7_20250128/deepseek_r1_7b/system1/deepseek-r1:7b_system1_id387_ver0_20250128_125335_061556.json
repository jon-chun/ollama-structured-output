    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's been arrested multiple times and has other behavioral issues. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: 21. Young adults can sometimes be less experienced but might still have substance use issues. Maybe they're more likely to engage in risky behavior as they navigate life.\n\nRace: White. Sometimes there are systemic factors that could influence risk, but without specific data, I should consider it neutral unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nNumber of arrests and convictions: 5 times. Repeated arrest can indicate underlying issues like substance abuse or unstable living situations which might increase future risk.\n\nPhysical characteristics: 6'2\" and 165 lbs. Not sure how that plays into risk directly, but maybe it relates to past behaviors where weight was a factor, though not certain.\n\nMarital status: Not married and not living alone. Living with others could mean different support systems or potential stressors which might influence behavior.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can lead to unstable life choices or lack of opportunities, increasing risk.\n\nJob history: Held 2 jobs in a year. Some work experience is positive but not enough to offset other negative factors.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to further trouble.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed over the past month, but considering he hasn't felt depressed recently doesn't mean there isn't an underlying issue that could cause depression later.\n\nChildhood environment: Lived with biological mother in a household of four in a rural area at a young age. That's a tough background which can have long-term effects on behavior and risk-taking.\n\nBelief in God: Says God has nothing to do with his personal life. This might indicate belief in materialism or lack of spirituality, but how does that affect risk? It could relate to lifestyle choices or values influencing behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: Multiple arrests, drug use, unstable living situation due to family background and not being married, low education. These factors point towards high risk. The child from a tough environment adds to the risk pool.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
