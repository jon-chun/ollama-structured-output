    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment step by step. The person is a 19-year-old male from White background, arrested once but not convicted. His stats are height and weight don't immediately stand out as concerning. He's single, living alone\u2014could be indicative of some stress or instability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and attending college, which might suggest he has goals and is committed to furthering his education. Employed three jobs during the year\u2014he\u2019s probably managing well with that income. Drug use in marijuana over four years could be a red flag; even if not convicted, repeated drug use can affect cognitive functions and decision-making.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might mean he's managing his stress or avoiding other issues. However, living with both biological parents at a young age in an urban household of six\u2014could indicate family instability or potential neglect, but since it was a positive experience for him, maybe not as concerning.\n\nHis religious belief that God has something to do with his life could be a positive motivator, but it's also a personal choice. Without more info on other risk factors like mental health issues beyond depression or substance abuse, the overall risk seems low. His education and stable living arrangements probably keep him on track without significant vulnerabilities.\n\nSo, putting all this together, while there are some minor red flags like past drug use and single status, his positive attributes might offset them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
