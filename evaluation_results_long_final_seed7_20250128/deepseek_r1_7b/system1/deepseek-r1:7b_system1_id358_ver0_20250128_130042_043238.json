    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 19-year-old male to determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 19 and he's a White male. Age can be a factor in recidivism, but at 19, it's more about his current behavior than past convictions. He has been arrested once but not convicted, which might show some prior issues but since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe the risk is lower.\n\nHe stands at 5'6\" and weighs 173 lbs. That doesn't immediately raise red flags regarding weight or health unless there's a history of eating disorders, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone\u2014living situation can be a factor, but without more info on his mental state or personal issues, it's hard to tell.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Maybe he's seeking higher education, or maybe he's looking for work opportunities. His education level could influence his stability.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year\u2014some work experience is positive, but if both were low-paying or unstable, that might be a concern.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down most of the time this month. Drug abuse can significantly impact behavior and mental health, which could increase risk.\n\nHis current mood seems quite low\u2014he's feeling so down that nothing cheers him up. This could indicate depression or a lack of motivation, both of which are concerning signs.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four at a young age\u2014family environment can influence behavior, but without knowing if there was abuse or neglect, it's hard to say how much impact this has.\n\nHis belief in God\u2014he might be religiously inclined, which could provide some stability, but it also depends on whether he's actively seeking help and aligning with supportive communities.\n\nPutting it all together: His arrest history isn't a conviction, so past behavior doesn't show repeat offenses. The low mood and possible drug use are significant red flags. Living alone without support might exacerbate his negative emotions. His young age is in his favor but could also mean he's more susceptible to external influences.\n\nConsidering these factors, I think the risk of recidivism here is high because of his current emotional state, substance use, and living situation which may not provide adequate support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
