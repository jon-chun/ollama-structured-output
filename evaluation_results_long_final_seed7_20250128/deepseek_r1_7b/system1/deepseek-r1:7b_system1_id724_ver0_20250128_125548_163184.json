    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, 21 isn't extremely young, but it's also not a prime working age. Being White doesn't inherently make someone higher or lower risk unless there are systemic issues, which I don't know about here.\n\nHe has been arrested 8 times and convicted. That's quite a high number of prior convictions. Each arrest can be a red flag for recidivism. Eight times is significant; that usually indicates past behavior that might lead to more issues.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches, which isn't unusual, and his weight is between 150-174 lbs. That's within the normal BMI range if I'm not mistaken. No obvious weight-related risk factors here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can increase vulnerability to stress or domestic issues, but without more context on living conditions or social support, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not having a degree might limit opportunities and could affect future job prospects, which in turn affects financial stability\u2014a risk factor.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive, but only two jobs might not be enough for long-term stability, especially if those were temporary or low-paying.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years\u2014marijuana use isn't as severe as harder drugs like cocaine or crack, so maybe it's a minor risk factor unless it's linked to other issues. He hasn't felt depressed over the past month; that's interesting because lack of depression can sometimes indicate lower risk, but if he has history of mental health issues, it could be different.\n\nHe lived with his biological dad in a household of four at a young age\u2014family living arrangements can influence behavior and support systems. A larger household might provide more supervision or stress, depending on the dynamics.\n\nFinally, he believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of religious support, which might be associated with different risk factors compared to those who have strong faith communities providing help.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior arrests (8) are a major concern for recidivism. The GED and not attending college can affect future earnings and job stability. Living alone without sufficient support could lead to stressors. While some factors might mitigate, the high number of prior convictions is a strong indicator of high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
