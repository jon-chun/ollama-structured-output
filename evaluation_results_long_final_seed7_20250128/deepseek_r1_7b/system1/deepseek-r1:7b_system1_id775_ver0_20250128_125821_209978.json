    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male from White background. Age is quite young, but being an adult and having previous convictions might be significant. He has been arrested once and convicted, which could mean prior negative behavior that the court found him responsible for.\n\nHe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 160 lbs. That's on the lighter side, so maybe lower weight could relate to substance use or other health issues. But I don't know if his weight directly contributes to risk unless it's linked to drug use.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Not attending college might mean he has limited opportunities, possibly leading to unstable situations. Being without these credentials can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors because he may not be motivated to seek better opportunities.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. That's quite limited; having no steady income could lead to financial instability or unemployment issues in the future. Also, holding just one job might mean he doesn't have skills for other areas, increasing his vulnerability to further challenges.\n\nDrug use: He used cocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug abuse can have serious consequences on both personal life and mental health. However, not feeling depressed now might suggest he's managed it or perhaps is dealing with other issues.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite living alone without a high school diploma. Maybe he's dealing with other stressors or has made positive changes in his life that mitigate depression symptoms.\n\nBiographically, at a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment could have its own set of risks, like limited support system or exposure to certain influences. Also, his belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life might indicate some spirituality issues or lack of religious guidance, which can sometimes be associated with risk-taking behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction at 18 is concerning but not unique among the population. His limited education and job opportunities point towards potential future challenges. Drug use without recent depression could be a red flag for ongoing issues. Living alone adds instability, and his past living situation might influence his current behavior in risky ways.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, he does present high risk characteristics that would warrant further evaluation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
