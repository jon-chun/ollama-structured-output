    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this risk factor step by step. First, let's break down each point given.\n\nThe person is a 20-year-old female Hispanic who hasn't been convicted yet but has one arrest. She's single and living alone. She has a high school diploma, no college attendance, and has held three jobs in the past year. Her drug use history is clean for four years, which is positive. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so she seems mentally stable.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area at a young age. That's a bit concerning because living in a larger family might indicate lack of supervision or potential domestic issues. Also, her religious affiliation is that God doesn't influence her personal life, which could suggest she lacks spiritual guidance and might be dealing with personal issues independently.\n\nHer mental state being positive for over a month adds to the good risk factors. However, considering her past living situation and the lack of religious support, there's some room for concern about potential home instability or family dynamics affecting her well-being.\n\nGiven these points, while she has several mitigating factors like clean drug use and employment history, the past living conditions might indicate a need for closer monitoring to ensure she doesn't face further issues related to family or environment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
