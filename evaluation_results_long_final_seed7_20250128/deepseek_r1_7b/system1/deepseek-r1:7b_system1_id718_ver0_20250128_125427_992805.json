    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to determine if this risk assessment indicates high risk for the individual described. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age might not directly correlate to risk unless there are other factors related to immaturity or dependency, but here it's just her age. No immediate red flags from this alone.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes indicate behavioral issues or past mistakes, but since she's not convicted, that might reduce the risk compared to someone who is actually on trial for a crime.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and between 125-149 lbs. That doesn't seem out of the ordinary; body type can vary widely among individuals.\n\nShe hasn't been married and isn't currently living alone, which might suggest she has some support system or is in a relationship. However, living arrangements don't directly indicate criminal risk unless there's evidence of domestic issues or neglect, which isn't provided here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not completing higher education can sometimes correlate with lower self-control and risk-taking behavior, but again, this alone doesn't necessarily mean she's at high risk without more context.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job opportunities suggests stability or flexibility, which could be a positive indicator rather than a negative one unless there's evidence of inconsistent work history or issues with employment.\n\nNot using drugs in the past four years is a strong positive factor; drug use can indicate substance abuse issues that might affect behavior but isn't directly linked to high risk without further info on other substance abusers or related incidents.\n\nShe felt so down for some time and couldn't find anything to cheer her up. This could be a sign of depression or low mood, which can sometimes be linked to stressors in life rather than an immediate criminal risk. However, chronic negative emotions might indicate underlying issues that could affect decision-making.\n\nHer young age indicates she's still developing socially and emotionally. Young individuals often have less life experience, which might mean they're more susceptible to peer influences or making impulsive decisions as a result of not yet fully understanding the consequences of their actions.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of four at a young age in a rural area. Being in a close family environment can sometimes provide stability and support, but it could also be a source of stress if there were disciplinary issues or neglect, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nConsidering her religious beliefs about God affecting her personal circumstances\u2014this might suggest she's seeking spiritual guidance for emotional well-being rather than indicating behavioral issues. However, the lack of evidence connecting religion to criminal behavior means this factor doesn't add much risk information on its own.\n\nPutting all these factors together: No prior convictions, stable living situation, positive employment history, drug-free record, and a young age with some minor negative emotions. The only potential concern is her age indicating immaturity, but without more info on related behavioral issues or family environment problems, it's hard to definitively say she's at high risk.\n\nTherefore, after considering all the factors, I would rate this as low risk but acknowledge that her age and minor emotional struggles could be areas of concern that might need further investigation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
