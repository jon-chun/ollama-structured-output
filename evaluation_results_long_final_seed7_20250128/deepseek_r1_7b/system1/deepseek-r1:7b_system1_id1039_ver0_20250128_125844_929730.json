    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to evaluate these risk factors for a 19-year-old female Hispanic who was arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's 5 feet 4 inches\u2014doesn't immediately stand out as tall or short in terms of risk. Her age is quite young, which might suggest she's still developing skills necessary for adulthood, but that alone isn't a strong indicator without other factors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, which could mean she's focused on her future but maybe not actively seeking employment, which could be a red flag. She hasn't worked during the year\u2014it might indicate she's either seeking better opportunities or facing financial difficulties, which could impact her stability.\n\nHer drug use is only marijuana over four years\u2014marijuana isn't as strongly associated with severe issues compared to other drugs like alcohol or harder drugs. However, even occasional use can affect judgment and decision-making.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might suggest she's mentally stable, but without more context on her mental health history, this could be a point against her risk.\n\nHer living situation is interesting\u2014she lived with eight adults in an urban area at a young age. That environment might provide support but could also expose her to negative influences if the people around her aren't supportive or if she's exposed to crime or unstable situations.\n\nShe considers God as a factor in her life, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, so that might actually reduce her risk rather than increase it.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a single arrest and conviction, which is low. Her living situation at a young age might be supportive but could also have negative aspects if not properly monitored. Her lack of employment and work history isn't directly linked to recidivism unless combined with other factors like drug use or unstable family environment.\n\nConsidering all these points without major red flags except maybe the living arrangement, I think she has low risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
