    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk factor for a 19-year-old male and determine if it indicates a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 19 years old. Young age can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their skills and decision-making abilities. But it's also possible that being younger might mean more potential for growth and positive change.\n\nHe identifies as White. I know that race can influence risk assessment because there have been studies showing that certain racial groups are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, but this is a single factor among many. So while race isn't definitive, it's something to consider alongside other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Being arrested even if not convicted can still be a significant risk factor because it shows some involvement with the legal system and may indicate prior behavior that could lead to further issues.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches and he weighs 140 lbs, which seems within a normal range for his age. I'm not sure how weight or height directly affects risk assessment, but it's something to note in case there are any indirect correlations with health or behavior.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Single status can sometimes be linked to higher risk because living alone might mean less support and more vulnerability to negative influences. However, the context of living with four people at a young age could influence this as well.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level is important; not completing higher education can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking criminal opportunities.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Having job experience is generally positive, as it shows responsibility and potential for upward mobility. However, if the jobs were related to illegal activities, that would be a different story. But since he's not convicted, maybe they're legitimate?\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014he used marijuana and cocaine but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse can have multiple effects. On one hand, it might lead to legal issues or other problems, but if he's not currently experiencing negative emotions like depression, that could indicate a change in mindset. However, recent drug use can still be risky.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite having drug use history. That's interesting because sometimes substance abuse can lead to mood changes, including depression. If he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe there are other factors at play, but it's something to consider in terms of mental health stability.\n\nLiving with four people from a young age in a rural area could mean he was exposed to various influences that might not be positive. Rural areas can sometimes have different social dynamics compared to urban settings, which might affect his risk profile differently.\n\nHis belief in God suggests a higher level of spiritual support and guidance. This could act as a protective factor against some forms of criminal behavior or substance abuse by providing alternative coping mechanisms or values.\n\nPutting all this together: He's young, has a arrest, no convictions, drug use history but recent positive state regarding depression. His living situation in rural area with four siblings might have had mixed influences. Being White and having a diploma but not college enrollment\u2014though education is positive, not completing it could be a risk.\n\nI think his past of substance abuse (even if he's not depressed now) can still pose risks. Plus, being under 20 means some life experiences aren't fully behind him yet. The lack of conviction on an arrest complicates things; maybe he has potential for positive change but hasn't proven it yet.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I would lean towards a high risk assessment. There's enough to suggest he could engage in further risky behavior despite not having a full conviction or being in college.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
