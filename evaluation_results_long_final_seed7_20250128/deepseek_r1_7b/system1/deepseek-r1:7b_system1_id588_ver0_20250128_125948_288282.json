    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18 years old. Young age can be a double-edged sword; it might mean he's still developing, but could also indicate more vulnerability or impulsivity.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. This is an ethnic background that doesn't directly relate to risk unless there are stereotypes involved, which I shouldn't assume here without specific data.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. Incarceration history matters; even if not convicted, it can show past legal issues and potential for future ones.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 1 inch is quite tall and heavy at 210 lbs. Could be related to substance use or health issues, which might increase risk factors indirectly.\n\nUnmarried and living alone suggests he's an only child or single parent, which can have social implications but not directly a crime-related risk unless there's instability around him.\n\nHigh school diploma in college now: Indicates education, which is positive. But sometimes, educational disparities can lead to other issues, so it's context-dependent.\n\nHe's worked five jobs in a year; part-time or freelance work isn't inherently bad but could suggest financial strain if not stable.\n\nDrug use past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse significantly increases risk of recidivism and other crimes.\n\nThe mention that he felt down for much of the past month raises depression symptoms, which can be linked to substance abuse and possibly criminal behavior like shoplifting or theft.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of two in an urban area: Could indicate family environment issues, maybe neglect if not provided. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, so that's another risk factor.\n\nBelieves in God for his personal issues\u2014no direct indication here, but spirituality can influence behavior and could be linked to substance use or other risky activities if it leads him away from help.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest, drug use, living situation, family background, and possible mental health issues are strong indicators of high risk. Each contributes to potential for further criminal activity.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
