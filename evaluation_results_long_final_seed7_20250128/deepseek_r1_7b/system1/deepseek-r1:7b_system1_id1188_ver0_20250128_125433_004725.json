    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down as a risk assessment expert. The person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. That demographic can sometimes carry higher risk factors due to systemic issues and historical data.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and convicted once. Three arrests are significant because each arrest can increase the risk of reoffending, especially if he has criminal history indicating unstable behavior or substance use.\n\nHis height and weight suggest he might be dealing with potential health issues like obesity, which is a risk factor for various chronic diseases that could impact his ability to manage daily life effectively. Being tall at 7 feet 9 inches without any context on body composition makes it a bit tricky, but combined with his weight of 177 lbs, which seems high for someone his height, this could be concerning.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence mental health; being an only child or living independently might correlate with higher stress levels or substance use issues.\n\nLack of a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college indicates he may have struggled academically, which can point to behavioral issues or a lack of life skills necessary for a stable environment. Additionally, not having educational support could be a risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year, which might suggest he's facing unemployment or underemployed situations, both of which can contribute to dependency on substances and instability in his personal life.\n\nUsing drugs (marijuana and cocaine) for four years, with some use in the last month when he felt particularly low. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential self-harm or harm to others, especially if it's leading to mood swings where he feels extremely down without any positive triggers. This could also affect his relationships or ability to manage daily responsibilities.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. While this isn't inherently harmful, living in an urban environment can expose him to various risks like higher crime rates, stress from community issues, and potential substance abuse within the family if both parent and child are involved.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could indicate a lack of spirituality or support system, which might affect his mental health. Without a strong support network, he's more vulnerable to substance use and potential self-harm.\n\nPutting all these factors together: multiple arrests, a possible high risk for health issues due to weight and height, living independently without a support system, substance abuse with significant implications on mood swings, lack of education and employment, and a personal philosophy that may contribute to resilience against help but also susceptibility to stressors. \n\nGiven the history of substance abuse and criminal history, along with potential health risks, it's likely he poses a high risk. While other factors might temper the risk slightly, the combination points towards needing closer monitoring and intervention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
