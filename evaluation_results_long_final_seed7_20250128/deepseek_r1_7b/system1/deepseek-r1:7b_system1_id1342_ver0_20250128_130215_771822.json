    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old Hispanic male who hasn't been convicted yet but has some arrest history. His living situation is stable\u2014he's married and living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and only two jobs, which might indicate he's trying hard to support himself.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years; using drugs can sometimes lead to substance abuse issues, which might affect his behavior or decision-making. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe that's mitigating some factors.\n\nHis background: He lived with his biological mother at a young age in a household of four. That could have had both positive and negative influences\u2014perhaps a close bond with his mother but also potential family dysfunction.\n\nReligion plays a role\u2014he believes God is involved in his life. That could be a strength, as spirituality often correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nConsidering all these factors: No prior conviction, stable living situation, education level, employment history, and religion are positive indicators. The only negative is past drug use. But since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe the drugs aren't having a significant negative impact on his current behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, while there's no conviction, the factors lean towards low risk, so I would predict \"NO\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
