    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk based on the information provided.\n\nFirst, let's look at the individual: a 20-year-old Black male. He's been arrested twice and convicted once. Being a repeat offender is a significant factor in risk assessment; it suggests past criminal behavior which can predict future actions.\n\nHe stands at 5'11\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs, which is within the normal range for his age but doesn't immediately indicate high risk unless there's more context about health or substance use. He's never married and living alone; that could mean he might not have a support system to help him if something goes wrong.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which might mean he's looking for further education as a way to improve his situation, possibly making him less likely to engage in criminal activities. However, it also shows he may be seeking better opportunities, reducing the immediate risk of reoffending.\n\nNo job experience during the year suggests he might not have steady income or skills that could lead to alternative opportunities. His drug use history is clean for four years but with recent feelings of low mood affecting his mental health.\n\nHe's had a tough childhood living with his biological dad in a household of four, which can contribute to behavioral issues and a lack of supervision. His religious belief might provide some coping mechanisms or support against negative emotions.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: past criminal history (2+ convictions), age that may have more weight on recidivism risk, no job experience indicating potential for finding better opportunities, and family background showing possible underlying issues. These points suggest a moderate to high risk, but without specific recidivist stats or further context, I'll lean towards high risk with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
