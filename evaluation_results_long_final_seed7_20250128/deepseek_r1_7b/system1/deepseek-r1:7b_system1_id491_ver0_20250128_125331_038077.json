    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual based on their criminal justice context. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male of White ethnicity. That might not be directly predictive but could influence other factors like community ties or access to resources.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. So his criminal history is minimal\u2014just an arrest without a conviction. That usually doesn't carry significant risk unless there's more information, which I don't have here.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 145 lbs. Not sure how that ties into risk factors; maybe if combined with other info like BMI, but nothing indicates it's relevant here.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. He has a dependent child since he's not cohabiting or living with someone else. That could indicate some level of dependency which might have implications on his behavior, though I'm not certain how strong that is as a risk factor.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. This suggests he has limited educational opportunities, which can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates due to limited skills and knowledge, but it's context-dependent.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Employment stability can affect substance use and other factors, so having just a single job might indicate lower commitment or higher risk of other issues.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. That's positive\u2014it shows he's abstaining, which is generally good for reintegration and lower risk.\n\nNo recent depression symptoms over the past month. Mental health is crucial; not experiencing depression suggests better mental stability.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological father in a household of four in a rural area. That might indicate family structure issues or environment that could influence behavior, but without knowing more about the family dynamics, it's hard to assess.\n\nHis belief in God plays a role in his personal outcomes; religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with prosocial behaviors and lower risk if he's attending regularly. However, his lack of information on attendance might affect this assessment.\n\nPutting all these together: minimal criminal history (arrest without conviction), stable but limited employment, no drug use, positive mental health, and family background that could be red or green depending on more info. Without more details, especially about family environment, education access, and other factors like substance abuse or mental health issues beyond what's stated.\n\nI think the risk is moderate to low because he doesn't have a criminal record (even if unconvicted), hasn't used drugs recently, and has positive indicators like mental health status. However, his limited educational background and single job might suggest some vulnerabilities that could contribute to higher risk over time but not immediately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction is based on the assessment of several risk factors: minimal criminal history (arrest without conviction), positive indicators such as no recent drug use and mental health, and some potential vulnerabilities like limited education and a single job. The overall confidence in this prediction is moderate to low due to these mixed signals.",
