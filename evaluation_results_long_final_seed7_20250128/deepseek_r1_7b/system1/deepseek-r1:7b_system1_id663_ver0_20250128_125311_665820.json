    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male Hispanic, arrested once but not convicted. That might suggest some criminal history, but since it's only an arrest and not a conviction, maybe less immediate risk. His weight is on the higher side at 5'8\" and 200-224 lbs, which could be related to alcohol or drug use.\n\nHe's single living alone, no high school diploma, so he might have struggled with education, possibly leading to unstable situations. He's only held one job, which might mean limited income stability or opportunities for upward mobility.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine, is concerning. The mention of feeling down during the last month adds stressors that could exacerbate substance use issues. His lack of religious belief about his personal life might influence his coping mechanisms; maybe he turns to substances more often when he's stressed.\n\nHis background: living with both parents at a young age in an urban area could mean exposure to environments that might have impacted him negatively, perhaps leading to dependency or other behavioral issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, while some points like drug use and lack of education are significant, the single arrest and being Hispanic don't immediately point towards high risk. However, his current situation seems vulnerable, so I'd lean towards a moderate confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
