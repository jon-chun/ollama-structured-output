    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this 20-year-old female. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a White female who's been arrested twice but not convicted. That might suggest some history of minor offenses without significant legal consequences. However, being White could potentially indicate she might be facing discrimination in the justice system, which could have broader implications on her outcomes.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 180 lbs. Weight can sometimes correlate with higher risk if it's obesity-related, but since I don't know her BMI or other health factors, this alone isn't enough to conclude high risk.\n\nMarried living with her spouse \u2013 stability here is positive, usually associated with lower recidivism rates compared to those who are homeless or living alone. So that's a mitigating factor.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college \u2013 indicates some level of education which can positively influence future behavior compared to those without formal education.\n\nShe has held four jobs in the past year. Having multiple stable jobs usually shows good work ethic and responsibility, which are associated with lower risk behaviors.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a red flag; even if not currently feeling depressed, past substance abuse can have long-term negative effects on employment, relationships, and overall well-being.\n\nHer living situation at a young age was with both parents in an urban household of three. This suggests she had a stable upbringing, which is generally protective against risk factors like violence or abuse early on.\n\nBelieving in God's influence over her personal life \u2013 religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with strong moral values and higher civic engagement, but it could also indicate a lack of other support systems if that's their primary reason for behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: She has minor legal issues, which might have social or systemic impacts. Her drug use is concerning and could lead to future issues. The rest of the factors seem mitigating except for the drug use. So overall, I'd lean towards a low risk but not necessarily high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
