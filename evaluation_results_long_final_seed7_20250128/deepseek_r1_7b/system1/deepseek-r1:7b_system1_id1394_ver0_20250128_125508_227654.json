    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for someone who is a Black male, 22 years old, hasn't been convicted yet but arrested once. He's taller and heavier than average, living alone without a spouse or children. He has a high school diploma, works three jobs, uses marijuana, feels down sometimes, lived with his mother at a young age, and believes in God.\n\nFirst, race is a significant factor here\u2014being Black can mean higher recidivism rates. Next, having an arrest but no conviction might still indicate potential for future issues. His demographics: living alone, not married, which are non-traditional family structures that could have different support systems.\n\nHe's got a high school diploma and isn't in college; maybe less education contributes to lower self-sufficiency or opportunities. Working three jobs suggests some financial stability but also might indicate busier life leading to stressors.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana is sometimes considered low risk, but even so, substance abuse can affect mental health and relationships. Feeling down a lot might point towards underlying mental health issues like depression or anxiety.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age could mean he was in an environment where he didn't have much support or had inconsistent care, which often correlates with higher risk of negative outcomes. Believing in God is positive, but sometimes that belief can lead to risky behaviors if there's a conflict between faith and substance use.\n\nPutting it all together: factors like race, past arrest, living situation, and mental health are strong indicators for high risk. The combination suggests he's more likely to engage in problematic behavior again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
