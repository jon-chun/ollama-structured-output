    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old White male. Age might be a consideration because younger individuals are often seen as less experienced but also maybe more prone to making impulsive decisions. Being White doesn't directly indicate risk without specific circumstances.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. That could mean he's managed to avoid legal consequences, which sometimes indicates discipline or perhaps not being in active criminal activity. But two arrests aren't a lot, so it might not be significant enough on its own.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 1 inch is quite tall, and he weighs 157 lbs. That's actually below average for his height since most adults around that height are between 160-180 lbs. Maybe not a risk factor unless combined with other issues like being underweight or overweight.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher risk of substance abuse, criminal behavior, or isolation leading to self-harm. But since he has a GED and isn't in college, maybe he's seeking help but doesn't have the support system yet.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Single job could mean stable income but might also indicate limited opportunities for advancement or support networks if something goes wrong.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. This is concerning because even though it's nonpsychoactive, repeated use can affect mental health and increase risk of substance abuse issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While some short-term fluctuations are normal, chronic depression should be addressed with therapy or medication if it persists.\n\nAt a young age (18) lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That's a tough start\u2014multiple siblings could lead to neglect or abuse issues. Urban environments might have different stressors compared to rural areas.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal life. This might indicate a lack of spiritual support, which some studies suggest can be linked to higher risk behaviors like drug use or antisocial behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He has two arrests but no convictions, so maybe not actively criminal. Drug use is present (marijuana), which could lead to other issues. Being in an urban household with multiple siblings might contribute to stress or neglect. His belief in God might be a factor if he's not seeking help for drug issues.\n\nHowever, since he has a GED and isn't in college, perhaps he's proactive about improving himself. The single job suggests some stability but could also mean limited support systems. The lack of depression over the past month is positive, so maybe he's managing things okay.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the drug use and family background. The lack of conviction might reduce immediate risk, but other factors point to potential higher risk in the long run.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
