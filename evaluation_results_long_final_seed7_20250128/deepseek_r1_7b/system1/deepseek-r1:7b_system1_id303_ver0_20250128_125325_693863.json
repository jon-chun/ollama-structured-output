    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. His race doesn't typically directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are systemic issues, which aren't indicated here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. One arrest can sometimes signal underlying issues, but since it's not a conviction, maybe he's managed to avoid serious charges despite an arrest. That might be a mitigating factor.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and he weighs 156 lbs. These stats don't immediately raise red flags regarding risk; body type can vary widely among individuals. Weight doesn't inherently predict criminal behavior unless there are other factors involved, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Being single and living alone might lead to feelings of loneliness or stress, but without evidence of domestic issues or emotional instability, this isn't a strong indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can influence risk; however, not being in school could mean he's actively seeking better opportunities or facing challenges that don't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior unless there's a history of low educational achievement.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences suggests some level of responsibility and stability, which might reduce recidivism risk compared to someone without work experience.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Drug use and mental health issues can be significant predictors of criminal behavior, but since he's drug-free and mentally stable, this is a positive sign.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological father in a household of four. This indicates he has family support, which usually correlates with lower risk as opposed to living with other relatives or no support at all.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate religious dis belief, which might be associated with higher risk if it's causing issues like drug use or antisocial behavior, but without evidence of such behavior, it's hard to link this directly to risk.\n\nPutting it all together: One arrest isn't a conviction and he hasn't had any serious issues mentioned. He's stable mentally and physically, has good support from family, and is actively engaged in employment and doesn't show signs of drug use or depression. The only negative point might be his past living situation with four people, but that's usually manageable unless there are extenuating circumstances not mentioned here.\n\nConsidering all factors, the risk seems to be low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
