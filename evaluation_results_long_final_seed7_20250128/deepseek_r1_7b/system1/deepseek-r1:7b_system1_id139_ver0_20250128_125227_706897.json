    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nShe's Black, which can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates in some contexts, but that depends on other factors too.\n\nShe's been arrested once without a conviction. That's one misdemeanor; however, the lack of a conviction might mitigate some risk because convictions are often more directly linked to future offenses.\n\nHer height and weight don't immediately indicate anything concerning regarding her health or behavior unless there's an underlying issue, but they're standard for her age group.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Being single can sometimes be a protective factor as she doesn't have family support, but it also means she might face isolation which could increase risk factors like substance use.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is inversely related to recidivism; higher education tends to correlate with lower risk.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. Employment history is positive for risk assessment as it shows stability, but having only two jobs at 20 might indicate she's still working her way through life or perhaps struggling.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug use can be a strong indicator of substance abuse which can lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe felt down for most of the past month and nothing could cheer her up. This could indicate depression or some stress issues, both of which are associated with higher risk of relapse or problematic behavior.\n\nLiving at a young age with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area can have implications on mental health and family dynamics, potentially leading to underlying issues that might contribute to risk.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious affiliation is generally protective as it provides support and guidance which may prevent risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there are some concerning signs like drug use, feelings of low mood, and living arrangements that could indicate higher risk. However, without conviction history and being Black can also play a role. I think the overall risk is moderate but on the higher side.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
