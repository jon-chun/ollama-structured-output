    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age seems too young for criminal charges, but race could be a factor in societal perception and support systems, though I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. That's a high number of convictions; multiple prior offenses are usually strong indicators of recidivism risk. So this points towards a high risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 5'6\" and 145 lbs don't raise immediate red flags in terms of risk factors related to behavior or health issues, so probably not much here.\n\nHe's single, living alone. Living situation can affect support networks, which might influence his ability to seek help or avoid further trouble. But I'm not sure how significant that is compared to other factors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education level often correlates with lower recidivism rates when higher education is available for support. Being without a degree could mean he's less likely to get employment opportunities, but also might have fewer resources to help him if he gets in trouble again.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year. Having some work experience can be positive as it shows he can manage basic needs and may have skills that could help him avoid further legal issues. However, three jobs over a year is not a lot, especially considering previous convictions; maybe it's inconsistent or temporary.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but specifically mentioned feeling down for most of the past month. Drug abuse can be a significant risk factor as it increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior or seeking other forms of support which might lead to more involvement with the criminal system.\n\nHis mental health: He feels extremely down for most of the past month, which could indicate depression or some form of stress disorder. Mental health issues are strong predictors of recidivism because untreated conditions can impede one's ability to function and make positive choices, increasing the chance of reoffending.\n\nLiving in a household of five at an early age with non-biological parents suggests he may have experienced abuse or neglect if that's common in such households. This could lead to behavioral issues or emotional instability, both of which are risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nHis belief in God might indicate a certain level of religious support and possibly some self-discipline, but it also shows he has internalized values that can either help or hinder depending on how he applies them. However, this alone isn't a strong indicator without more context on his beliefs' impact on his behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior convictions (6), drug use (marijuana and cocaine), mental health issues (feeling down most of the month), living in a large household with non-biological parents, and no high school diploma. These factors strongly suggest a high risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
