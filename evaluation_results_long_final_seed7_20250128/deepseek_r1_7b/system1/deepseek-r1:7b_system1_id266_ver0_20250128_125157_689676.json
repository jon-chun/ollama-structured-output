    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk for this person. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male Hispanic. His race doesn't directly correlate to risk unless there's a specific statistic, but it's not mentioned here. Age is young, which might mean he's still developing socially and emotionally, so maybe lower risk compared to older individuals.\n\nHe has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's significant because past convictions, especially for any offense, can indicate previous behavior that may lead to higher risk in the future.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 6 inches, which isn't directly relevant unless it affects his ability or self-image. Since he's not married and living alone, he might be managing without a partner, so maybe lower risk there.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED but isn't in college. This could mean he has limited opportunities and might struggle with basic skills which can affect employment and relationships\u2014potentially a red flag for risk.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year, which is better than not working at all. However, having just one job might mean he relies on it too much if he loses it or faces difficulties.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014he used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have various reasons and isn't always a clear indicator of future behavior unless there's a history suggesting substance abuse disorder or dependence.\n\nHe feels no depression in the past month, which might suggest he's stable emotionally, but it could also be a result of his current environment or lack of issues.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at age 4 in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher stress levels and social risks, and living away from one's support system (as he moved out at 18) might leave him exposed to potential family neglect or abuse.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life, which is a strong moral compass. People with high moral values often make better decisions, so this might lower risk compared to those without such guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior arrest, living alone (could be lonely), limited education and employment, past drug use, and exposure from his early environment. These factors could indicate moderate risk. However, since he's only 21, some of these issues might still be developing, so the risk isn't extremely high but not low either.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n- The person has a prior arrest and conviction, which are significant negatives indicating past behavior that could impact future outcomes.\n- Living alone at such a young age might lead to feelings of isolation or potential neglect, contributing moderately to risk.\n- Limited educational background and employment history (only one job) suggest instability or dependence on a single source for income, which can be risky if circumstances change.\n- Past drug use in the last four years introduces uncertainty about future substance use behavior, which could affect relationships and health.\n- Exposure from early family environment, particularly living with an extended family at age 4 in an urban setting, might lead to social or emotional challenges.\n- Despite having a moral compass (believing in God), this can sometimes act as a protective factor against certain risks.\n\nConsidering all these factors collectively, they contribute moderately to risk but do not reach the threshold of high risk. The confidence level is set at 65% based on the balance between negative indicators and the individual's age and potential resilience from his moral beliefs.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
