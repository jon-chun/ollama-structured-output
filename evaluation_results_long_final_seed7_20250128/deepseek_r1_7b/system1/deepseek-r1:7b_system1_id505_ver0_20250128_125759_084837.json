    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk factor for a 19-year-old male and determine if it indicates high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 19 years old, which is quite young, so maybe that doesn't directly contribute but could be relevant in terms of judgment or responsibility. He identifies as White\u2014maybe irrelevant unless there's a societal factor related to race and crime rates, but I don't have specific info on that here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That might suggest he's somewhat law-abiding but could also indicate previous issues that haven't reached a full conviction. Not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nHis height and weight\u20145 feet 10 inches and 155 lbs. Doesn't seem out of the ordinary, no indication of obesity or anything that would be red flags here.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Unmarried adults often live on their own for various reasons, so this isn't a strong risk factor unless there's something else about his living situation that suggests instability, but I don't have info on that.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in 4-year college\u2014suggesting he's educated but maybe not actively looking to further his education or has had some challenges keeping up. Being in college might indicate he's working towards betterment, which is positive.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014so he's employed, possibly stable if it's a full-time position. Maybe indicates financial stability and responsibility.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years, with recent use in the last month feeling down. Drug use can affect judgment, behavior, and relationships. Recurrent drug issues might signal potential for substance abuse disorders which could impact his ability to function responsibly.\n\nFeeling down often makes him feel unmotivated or hopeless. This could indicate low self-esteem or mental health issues, both of which are risk factors on their own.\n\nYoung age at which he lived in a household of five\u2014could suggest living with multiple family members, possibly including alcohol or drug use if common in such households. But again, without knowing the composition, it's hard to say.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal events\u2014affecting his spirituality and potential mental health. Some people cop out on religion when they're going through tough times, so this might not be a strong indicator unless he shows other signs of mental instability.\n\nPutting all these together: He has a history of substance use (marijuana, cocaine), recent feelings of low motivation, and young age which could be linked to living in challenging circumstances. His employment and education suggest some level of responsibility but also possible vulnerabilities due to drug issues. The young age at home with five people might contribute to environment stressors.\n\nI think the key factors here are his recent substance use, the feeling of hopelessness, and perhaps his age which could relate to how he copes emotionally or socially. These could increase the risk compared to someone without these issues. However, without more info on his living situation's impact or other behavioral signs, I'm not entirely confident.\n\nSo, considering all that, I would lean towards a high risk but with some caution. Maybe 75% confidence?\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
