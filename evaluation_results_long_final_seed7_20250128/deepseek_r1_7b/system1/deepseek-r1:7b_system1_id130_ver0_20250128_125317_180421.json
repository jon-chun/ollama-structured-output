    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the person described. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is usually a minor factor in risk assessment unless there's something specific about his age related to criminal behavior, but since it's just 21 and he has only one arrest without a conviction, I don't think that stands out here.\n\nHe's 6 feet 5 inches and weighs over 250 lbs. That makes him quite large, which could potentially be a risk factor if he has issues with weight management or substance use. He's used marijuana in the past four years, so drug use is definitely a red flag. Drug abuse can lead to unstable behavior, which might increase his risk of reoffending.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's interesting because sometimes substance use can lead to mental health issues, but since he doesn't feel depressed now, maybe he's managed it well. Still, drug use is a concern regardless of current mental health symptoms.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating, which might contribute to depression or other mental health issues. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, so that might mitigate some risk factors related to isolation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This could indicate some level of education but also maybe a desire to stay out of trouble or not pursue further education which sometimes is linked to higher crime rates.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience can be beneficial as it shows responsibility and ability, so that might actually lower his risk rather than increase it.\n\nConsidering his past living situation: at a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of seven in an urban area. That's a lot of people under one roof, which could lead to stress or neglect issues. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and stress levels, so that might be a contributing factor.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks He has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief might suggest a sense of control or purpose, which could potentially reduce risk factors related to impulsive behavior or lack of direction.\n\nPutting it all together: The key points are the past drug use (marijuana), living alone without recent depression, and the large physique which might relate to weight management issues. His living situation with seven people in an urban area is a concern but maybe not as significant as other factors like drug use. He's 21, so perhaps more inclined towards risk-taking behaviors.\n\nI think the strongest indicators are the past drug use and possibly the size leading to potential health issues or unstable behavior. Considering that he hasn't felt depressed recently might downplay some of the negative aspects from his living situation.\n\nSo, I would rate this as a high risk with maybe an 80% confidence level because there are clear risk factors like drug use and living circumstances contributing, but not exclusively. The size could also be a factor if it's linked to health issues or substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
