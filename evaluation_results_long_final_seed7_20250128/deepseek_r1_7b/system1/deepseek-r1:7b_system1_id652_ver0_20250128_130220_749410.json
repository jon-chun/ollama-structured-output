    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if these risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who was arrested once but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even though he's not convicted, it could mean he has a criminal history that might affect his stability. But since it's just one arrest and no conviction, maybe it doesn't indicate high risk yet.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That seems like an above-average build, but I don't know how that relates to risk. Maybe if he's physically strong or has a history of violence, but there's no info on that here.\n\nHe's living alone with no family since he was young and moved out at 18. No kids either. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to mental health issues, like depression or substance abuse.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe he's seeking higher education but hasn't started yet. If he's not engaged in learning, he might be under stress or facing unemployment, which could affect his mental health.\n\nHe's worked two jobs during the year, so he probably has some support income. That's a positive sign because it suggests financial stability to cover basic needs and maybe some extras.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana before but not recently. However, in the past month, he felt really down and couldn't find anything to cheer him up. This could indicate depression or a lack of purpose, which might be related to substance abuse issues.\n\nHe lived with both parents at a young age (around 13-14) in an urban area. That's quite early and in a big city, so he might have seen a lot of stress or exposure that could impact his mental health later on.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life suggests he might be atheist or agnostic. This could affect his support system; without religious guidance, maybe he relies more on secular help or has higher rates of seeking other forms of support like substance abuse or mental health services.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, has a potential family issue from early life which might have caused stress, some drug use but not recent, and is now working. The lack of conviction in his arrest isn't severe. However, the deep depression he feels during the past month could be a significant risk factor. His belief system might affect how he copes with stress.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of his recent feelings of deep sadness and potential mental health issues. The factors related to living alone, family history, and drug use in combination with his current mood could indicate that he's at higher risk for things like recidivism or other negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
