    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who fits all the given criteria.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female from White background. She's been arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises some red flags about her criminal history. Being under 25 with only one offense isn't necessarily terrible, but it does suggest she might still be dealing with some underlying issues that led to this arrest.\n\nShe is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 106 lbs. That's pretty slim, so I should consider if there are any health implications here. Maybe related to mental health or substance use? She has never been married and lives alone, which could contribute to feelings of loneliness or depression\u2014something that might have led her to seek help but also could be a risk factor.\n\nShe holds a high school diploma and is in college, indicating she's educated but perhaps struggling with academic or personal challenges. Working three jobs suggests she's trying to manage multiple responsibilities but maybe facing challenges that are causing stress.\n\nDrug use history: She admitted to marijuana use in the past four years, which could mean she's experimenting or using it recreationally. That might point towards substance abuse issues. Also, feeling down for some of the past month could indicate mood swings or depression, both of which can affect mental health and behavior.\n\nLiving with her parents at a young age in a household of four in a rural area suggests she had a sheltered upbringing but maybe lacks support networks. Being in a small, rural community could mean limited access to resources or support for dealing with stressors like substance use or emotional struggles.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest history is concerning, especially as someone so young. Drug use and emotional distress are significant issues that can escalate into more serious behavior if not addressed. Her living situation might exacerbate feelings of isolation and anxiety. Being in college could also mean she's facing academic pressures, which might contribute to stress.\n\nHowever, considering her age (18) and being in her second year or so in college, it might be early for some serious issues to fully manifest. But the combination of these factors\u2014arrest history, drug use, emotional distress, living alone, limited support network\u2014it all adds up. I would lean towards high risk because she has multiple indicators pointing towards potential substance abuse, mood disorders, or behavioral issues that could escalate.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about her education level and how it ties into the risk factors. She's in college but working three jobs\u2014maybe academic stress? It's possible, but without more info on grades or academic performance, it's hard to say if that directly contributes to risk.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I think 75% is reasonable because there are multiple warning signs pointing towards a high-risk profile. However, her age being so low might temper some of these factors, but given the other points, I still think she's at higher risk than average.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
