    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's a 20-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That seems like a significant risk factor because prior convictions are usually associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 140 lbs. While weight can be an indicator of being underweight or possibly not taking care of his health, I don't see any information about BMI here. Maybe it's not a major issue unless combined with other factors like lack of education or living situation.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living in a single room without support from a spouse could contribute to higher risk of issues like drug use or unstable situations, especially given his prior convictions.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. This points towards lower educational attainment, which can lead to poor decision-making, increased substance use, and possibly not seeking help when needed, all of which are risk factors.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs is actually positive as it shows some stability and ability to support himself, but if he's been unemployed for a long time or hasn't earned much, that could be concerning too. However, holding three jobs seems better than not having one at all.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) can indicate potential substance abuse issues. Substance use often correlates with higher risk of criminal behavior or other negative outcomes.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While recent lack of depression might suggest he's okay, it could also be due to not having access to mental health resources during his arrest and living situation. So maybe this isn't a strong indicator on its own.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting can have both positive and negative aspects. Urban areas might offer more opportunities but could also be environments where stress or neglect occurs. His belief in God might provide some stability, which is a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest and conviction are strong indicators of higher risk. Lack of education and living alone increase the likelihood of instability. Drug use without any positive signs (like using it to escape depression) could be concerning. His background isn't a clear negative but might have some stressors. Considering all these, I'd lean towards high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
