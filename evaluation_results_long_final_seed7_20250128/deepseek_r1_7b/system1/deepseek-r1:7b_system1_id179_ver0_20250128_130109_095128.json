    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female of White ethnicity. Ethnicity alone isn't a significant risk factor unless there's evidence of discrimination or bias, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That might be a red flag because arrest can sometimes lead to prior convictions if it resulted in a plea deal or a court appearance. However, since she hasn't been convicted, maybe that's not as concerning. Still, an arrest could indicate some past behavior issues.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 6 inches and weight 160 lbs\u2014nothing jumps out as abnormal here. She's single and living alone, which might suggest she's independent but doesn't directly relate to risk unless there are other factors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education level can be both protective and risk depending on the field of study or future goals. High education often correlates with better job opportunities, so maybe not a high risk factor.\n\nShe's employed one job during the year\u2014again, employment itself isn't a strong indicator unless there were issues like unemployment spells or inconsistent work history. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive but doesn't directly tie to risk without more context.\n\nUsing drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors, but not necessarily substance abuse itself unless it's a chronic issue. Her recent lack of depression might suggest she's mentally stable, though that depends on her support system.\n\nShe was raised in an urban area at age 5 with five people in the household under God. That living situation could indicate family dynamics or possible neglect, which might be concerning but without more info on it, it's hard to gauge fully.\n\nHer belief in God personally is a strong factor. If she doesn't feel any spiritual guidance or support, that could affect her mental health and decision-making. Her lack of connection with a higher power can sometimes lead to coping issues or higher risk behaviors like substance abuse if she turns to other substances instead of seeking professional help.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some minor red flags like the arrest and drug use, the main factors don't strongly indicate high risk without more context. Her education, stable living situation (though in an urban area), lack of recent depression, and belief in God seem to be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
