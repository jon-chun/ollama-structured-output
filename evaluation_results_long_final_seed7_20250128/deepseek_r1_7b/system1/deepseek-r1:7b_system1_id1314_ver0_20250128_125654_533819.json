    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given information. Let me break down each point and analyze them step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male of Black descent. Age-wise, being 21 isn't too concerning yet; it's still early in his/her life. However, being Black might be a factor depending on any racial biases or data, but without specific context, I can't assume that.\n\nHe has been arrested two times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests are important because they indicate potential trouble with the law. But since he hasn't been convicted of anything, maybe this is less severe than someone who has been convicted. However, having arrests still shows instability or at least some involvement in the system.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 1 inch and 170 lbs. While these stats might be relevant for other assessments like physical risk, in a criminal justice context, they don't directly indicate much about his criminal behavior unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of possible isolation or stress, but without knowing more about his environment or social support, it's hard to say how this affects risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence recidivism rates; generally, higher education might correlate with lower recidivism because people are better equipped to handle the workforce or community challenges. But he is working one job, which could mean he's stable financially, but maybe underemployed.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs for four years and isn't feeling depressed over the past month. Drug use avoidance and mental health indicators like no depression can be positive signs. They might suggest better self-discipline and a positive outlook, which are usually associated with lower risk of reoffending.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of five. Sibling count at 5 doesn't inherently indicate high risk unless there's more to it, but again, without context like family dynamics or environment, I can't assess this fully.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal events. This religious belief might not directly relate to criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues related to faith, but since the person isn't actively involved in any negative activities based on the given info, it's a neutral factor.\n\nPutting all these together: He has a clean drug history, no current mental health issues, working and stable living situation. The only red flags are two arrests without convictions. Without more information about his behavior or circumstances that led to those arrests, it's hard to definitively say he's high risk. However, the number of past arrests might suggest some underlying instability.\n\nGiven that there have been two arrests but no convictions, and other factors seem positive, I would lean towards a lower risk level. Maybe around 25% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
