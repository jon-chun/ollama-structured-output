    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female of White ethnicity. Not sure how that plays into it yet, but maybe her background could influence her behavior or willingness to seek help.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate prior incidents where she was involved in the legal system but didn't face consequences beyond arrest. Maybe this could be a sign of transient behavior rather than a long-term issue.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches and she weighs 120 lbs, which seems on the lighter side. Not sure how that relates to risk without more context, like body type or past weight changes.\n\nShe's married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to increased stress or isolation, which might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education could mean she has fewer resources or opportunities, potentially leading her into risky situations. Also, not being enrolled in college might indicate instability in her life goals.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year. Having a stable job is important for financial stability and providing a sense of purpose. Having just one job might leave her vulnerable if that job were to change or disappear.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana and cocaine use but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have significant consequences, both immediate (like health issues) and long-term ( addiction). However, the fact that she hasn't felt depressed lately might suggest she's not in an acute crisis.\n\nShe lived at a young age with her biological mother in a household of five. A large family could mean more supervision or stress from siblings, which might influence her behavior. Alternatively, it could also indicate she was raised in a different environment without her knowledge.\n\nLastly, she considers that God has nothing to do with her personal events. This lack of religious involvement might affect her willingness to seek help or moral decision-making based on faith.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors that stand out are the arrest but no conviction, which could indicate past behavior issues; living alone and being married, which might relate to stressors in her life; lack of education leading to unstable situations; and drug use despite not feeling depressed recently. These seem like they contribute to a higher risk.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think she's at a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
