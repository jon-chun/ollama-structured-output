    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if this risk assessment indicates high risk for the individual based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male of White ethnicity. That alone doesn't raise major red flags, though it's worth noting that certain demographics can have different risk profiles in some contexts, but without more info, I'll move on.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and a conviction. A single prior offense is significant but not necessarily high risk unless it's a serious crime. Since the type isn't specified, maybe it's a minor offense, so perhaps lower risk compared to someone with multiple serious convictions.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 135 lbs. No direct info on how this affects risk, but combined with other factors might be relevant if considering things like physical activity or health risks, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's single and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behavior or substance use, but again, without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. This indicates he might have lower educational attainment, which is often associated with higher recidivism rates. People with less education may face barriers to better opportunities and could be at higher risk for reoffending.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs can sometimes indicate financial stability, but it also depends on the nature of the work. Three jobs might suggest he has some earning potential, which isn't inherently high risk if his current job is stable.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only) and no recent depression symptoms. While drug use could be a risk factor for further issues like substance abuse or crime, since it's limited to marijuana, it might not be as severe as other drugs. No recent signs of depression are positive but doesn't directly indicate current risk.\n\nHe lived in a household of five at a young age. Large households can sometimes correlate with higher risk of domestic issues or substance use among family members, which could influence his behavior.\n\nHis belief that God has no role in his personal life might suggest he's more materialistic or less religiously inclined, possibly leading to riskier lifestyle choices if this extends into other areas like drug use or criminal activity.\n\nPutting it all together: educational barriers and past substance use are concerning. The lack of a stable living situation (living alone) could also be a contributing factor. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, that's a positive sign. While his age is low, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk-taking behaviors, but without specific information on behavior, it's a bit tricky.\n\nConsidering all these factors moderately, I would lean towards high risk because of the educational issues and past substance use, despite some mitigating factors like living alone.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
