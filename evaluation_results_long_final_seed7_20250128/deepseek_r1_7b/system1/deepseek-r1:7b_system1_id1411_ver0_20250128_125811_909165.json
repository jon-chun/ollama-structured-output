    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age might not be directly indicative of risk unless considering if he's too young to handle responsibilities, but 22 seems about right. Being White doesn't inherently pose a higher risk; it could be related to socioeconomic factors instead.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted once. Having multiple arrest records typically indicates a history of problematic behavior, which can suggest higher recidivism risk. Each conviction is a point that could increase the risk assessment.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 4 inches and he weighs 190 lbs. While this might indicate a certain level of physical build or health, without information on body mass index (BMI) or related health issues, it's hard to assess directly. However, if he's significantly above average in weight, it could imply potential health risks like obesity.\n\nHe is not married and currently not living alone. Living situation can affect mental health\u2014being with family might offer support, while being single could lead to isolation. Without knowing the surrounding environment or support network, it's a bit tricky, but being single can be a risk factor for mental health issues.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Educational attainment usually correlates with better job prospects and lower recidivism rates. However, if he's not completing his education, that could indicate other issues, but in this case, he's still pursuing further education, which is positive.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Job stability can impact mental health\u2014being unemployed or underemployed might lead to stress and depression. Holding a job might provide a sense of purpose and control, so maybe not as high a risk if he was employed but perhaps if it's low-paying or unstable.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana, and felt extremely down during the last month that nothing could cheer him up. Substance use can lead to mood swings, depression, and other mental health issues, which are significant red flags for high risk.\n\nHis past living situation at a young age with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area suggests exposure to potentially adverse environments\u2014crowded living conditions or neglect, which could have long-term effects on his mental health and behavior. Urban areas can also expose individuals to more stressors like crime, lack of resources, etc.\n\nHe believes that God has no impact on his personal life. This might indicate a lack of religious support system, which can affect mental well-being, especially in times of crisis or uncertainty. Without guidance or belief systems, he might struggle with coping mechanisms for negative emotions.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests and convictions increase the risk. Substance use, particularly marijuana, is a strong indicator of potential issues. His current living situation without support (living alone) could exacerbate mental health challenges. His lack of religion might also contribute to his mood swings. While some factors like education and job are positive, several warning signs point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
