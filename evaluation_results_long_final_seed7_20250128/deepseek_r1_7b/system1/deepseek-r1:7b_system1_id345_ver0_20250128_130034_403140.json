    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this risk assessment task for a 20-year-old male. Let me break down each risk factor and see how they contribute to the overall risk level.\n\nFirst off, he's a White male, which doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of race-based risk assessments, but it's good to note. He has a criminal history with one arrest and a prior conviction. That's a solid point towards higher risk because prior convictions are strongly predictive of recidivism.\n\nHis height is 5'7\", weight 128 lbs \u2013 not particularly concerning on the physical side. No family ties here; he's living alone, never married. That might suggest some instability or lack of support, which can be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Not continuing education could indicate lower motivation or higher risk of involvement in similar issues again. He's held four jobs in the past year \u2013 that seems manageable unless previous joblessness increased his risk elsewhere.\n\nDrug use: he's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That's interesting because drug use can sometimes be a coping mechanism, so maybe not as concerning unless it's recent or intensive use.\n\nHis belief in God is positive and could contribute to moral stability, countering any negative risk factors from drug use or prior issues.\n\nLooking at his background: he lived with both parents at a young age in a household of four rural area. That might suggest he has some support system but living alone now could indicate a loss of that support as he gets older or faces life challenges.\n\nOverall, while there are some mitigating factors like being White and having good religious beliefs, the prior conviction is a strong indicator of high risk. I'd lean towards \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
