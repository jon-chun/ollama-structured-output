    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this risk factor indicates high risk based on the given information. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 21 might be early in his career or still in school, which could mean he's more adaptable and less likely to have a solid criminal history yet. Being White isn't directly related to risk unless there are systemic issues, but that's not specified here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can indicate potential trouble, but not being convicted might mean he's managed to avoid serious charges or maybe he's in a stable situation without needing more severe penalties.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and weight 160 lbs. This doesn't directly relate to risk assessment unless it's about physical capacity for labor, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and currently not living alone. Living with others might suggest he has support or is in a stable environment without needing protection services.\n\nHe completed associate/junior college but isn't enrolled in college. Maybe he's actively seeking further education or training, which could reduce risk if he's motivated to change.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having previous work experience can be positive as it shows responsibility and financial stability, reducing the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes correlate with other risky behaviors or issues, but without clear signs of depression affecting his behavior, maybe it's not a strong indicator here.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite drug use. That's interesting; perhaps he's managing his substance use well and is in a positive mental state, which could mitigate any negative impacts from drug use.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of four. Early family involvement can provide stability but might also indicate family dynamics that could be problematic if there are issues like abuse or neglect. However, since it's specified as a household of size 4 without indicating specific problems, maybe this is a positive factor.\n\nHe believes God has no influence over his life. This could relate to his personal beliefs and how that affects his behavior. Without religious guidance, he might seek other sources of support, but it doesn't directly point to criminal behavior unless coupled with other negative factors.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some negative indicators like a past arrest and drug use, the lack of conviction, positive educational background, employment history, and family living situation with no significant issues suggest that this person might not be a high risk. The factors present don't strongly point towards high recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 58\n}\n```",
