    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor since prior convictions are typically correlated with higher recidivism rates. So that's a YES.\n\nHe's White, which might be related to certain risk profiles based on studies, but I don't have enough info here. Let's note it as neutral for now.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight between 150-174 lbs. No direct info on how that affects risk, so probably not a major factor.\n\nNot married and living with someone else isn't a red flag unless there are issues mentioned elsewhere, which I don't see here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with lower risk if he's seeking better opportunities, but without knowing his motivation or previous work history, it's hard to say.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment for an extended period is usually a red flag as it might indicate lack of support system or skills.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some recent use (past month) is concerning. Drug abuse can significantly increase recidivism risk, especially if he's relapsing.\n\nMood: He feels down and has been in low spirits for much of the past month. This could be a sign of mental health issues or substance abuse impacting his mood.\n\nLiving with four family members in a rural area at a young age. While living with multiple relatives might provide support, it's also possible that there are underlying family dynamics contributing to current issues.\n\nHe believes God has no impact on his life, which might indicate a lack of faith or spirituality, but I don't know if that directly ties into risk without more context.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest and conviction (YES), drug use (YES), unemployment (possibly YES depending on cause), mood issues (YES). The other factors are neutral. High school diploma and living with family might suggest he's got some support, but the arrest, drug use, and mood could outweigh that. So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
