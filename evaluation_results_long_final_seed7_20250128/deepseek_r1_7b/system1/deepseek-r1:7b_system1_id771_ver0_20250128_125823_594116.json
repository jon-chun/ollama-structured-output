He\u2019s been arrested three times and convicted once, which is a significant red flag. At 5'11\" and 160 lbs, he might be at higher weight-related risks. Not being married and living alone could mean he's seeking social support but isn't getting it consistently.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college, so his education level is average, which can affect future employability and stability. He only held one job last year, indicating limited income consistency or redundancy. No drug use in the past four years is positive, showing he's been clean for some time.\n\nNot feeling depressed over a month might suggest he's mentally stable, but considering his arrest history, I'm cautious about potential underlying mental health issues that aren't reported here. His early life living with his mom in a household of two could indicate a stable, albeit perhaps non-religious, upbringing, which might correlate with different risk factors.\n\nHis lack of religious affiliation makes him more detached from support systems like community or family prayers for guidance. All these points together suggest he's at a moderate to high risk due to the arrest history and living situation.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
