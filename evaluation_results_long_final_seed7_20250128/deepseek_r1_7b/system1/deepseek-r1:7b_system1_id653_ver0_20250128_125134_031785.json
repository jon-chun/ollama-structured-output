    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates high risk for this specific individual. Let me go through the factors one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female from Hispanic heritage. Hispanic background can sometimes be associated with certain types of criminal behavior, but it's not a definitive indicator on its own. So that might lean towards moderate risk, but I need to look at other factors too.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. That\u2019s an important point because being arrested without a conviction doesn\u2019t always predict future criminal behavior as strongly as convictions do. So maybe this isn\u2019t the strongest indicator of high risk.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 155 lbs, which is on the lighter side. Weight can sometimes be related to substance abuse or certain health issues, but she hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that's a positive sign. No drug use suggests better self-control over substances.\n\nShe\u2019s never been married and currently living alone. Living independently might correlate with lower risk factors like fewer stressors from family relationships, which could be both good and neutral depending on other factors. But alone living can sometimes indicate past issues, but she has no family members here, so maybe that's a mitigating factor.\n\nShe holds a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing higher education might increase risk because sometimes people without diplomas turn to criminal activities as a result of lack of opportunities or skills. But not being enrolled could mean she's seeking better education, which is positive.\n\nShe has only held one job during the year. A single job can be risky if it\u2019s unstable or related to low-level crime, but again, not having multiple jobs doesn't necessarily predict risk on its own.\n\nHer lack of recent drug use and depression over the past month are strong negatives. Not using drugs for four years suggests she's in control of her substance use, which is a positive indicator. Additionally, not feeling depressed could indicate good mental health or low exposure to stressful situations that might lead to depression.\n\nShe was raised in an urban area with her biological mother at a young age and considers God involved in her life. Family background can play a significant role; living with her mom at 2 in an urban setting might have provided some stability, but considering she's Hispanic, there could be cultural factors that influence behavior as well.\n\nPutting all these together: No prior convictions despite arrests, good mental health (no depression), no drug use, living independently without family issues (as far as we know), single job, GED, and lack of recent criminal history. These factors seem to suggest lower risk rather than high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
