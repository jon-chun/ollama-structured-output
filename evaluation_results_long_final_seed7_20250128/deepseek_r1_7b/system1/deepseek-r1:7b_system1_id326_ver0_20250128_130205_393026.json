    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the person described. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. While race can be a factor in some risk assessments, it's more about systemic issues than individual characteristics. So maybe not too significant on its own.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate a prior with the legal system, which could be concerning. However, since he wasn't convicted, his actual criminal history is clean, so that's a positive point.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'7\" and between 150-174 lbs. No immediate red flags there; weight isn't necessarily a risk factor unless it's related to other health issues.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Living with family can be protective, but living alone doesn't inherently make someone high risk without more context on his living situation's stability or surrounding environment.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level is usually associated with lower recidivism rates, so this might actually reduce the risk.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can indicate good financial stability and life skills, which are protective factors.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a red flag because it might affect judgment or increase substance abuse issues, which can lead to further problems.\n\nHis belief that God has something to do with his personal events suggests he's religious and may seek help or guidance when needed, which is positive.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of a conviction despite an arrest is a point against him. His job history shows some stability, but the drug use isn't directly related to his current behavior unless it's a recent issue. Since he's 20, still relatively young, and has no prior convictions, maybe the risk is low.\n\nI think overall, these factors don't strongly indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 10, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
