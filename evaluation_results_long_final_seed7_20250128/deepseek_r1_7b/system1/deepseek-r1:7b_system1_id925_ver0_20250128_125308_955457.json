    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White, which doesn't directly indicate much on its own unless combined with other factors. Next, he's been arrested once without a conviction. That one arrest might suggest some past behavior issues, but since it's not a conviction, maybe it's less severe.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 190 lbs. That's quite tall and heavy; could indicate some health concerns like hypertension or obesity, which can increase risk factors indirectly.\n\n living alone: single status might be related to higher risk due to isolation or possible neglect issues, but this is just a factor without other context.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school: educational stability often correlates with lower recidivism rates because it's seen as a positive step towards better opportunities.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having at least some employment experience can be beneficial for reintegration and reducing future criminal activity.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone isn't a strong indicator of high risk if there's no co-occurring issues like depression, which might suggest substance abuse without severe mental health problems.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of three. This might indicate a stable early family environment, but it depends on other factors too.\n\nLastly, his belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could relate to spirituality or mental health issues. If he's not seeking religious support and is experiencing stress without seeking help, this could be a red flag for mental health complications that might influence risk behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest isn't enough to label him high-risk. His education and job status are positive indicators. The lack of recent depression suggests no severe mental health issues. However, the potential for underlying substance abuse or other behavioral issues should be considered. The belief in God not affecting his life might hint at other underlying issues that could impact his risk behavior.\n\nI think I need to weigh these factors. Since there's only one arrest and positive steps like school and job, maybe he's low to moderate risk. But considering possible drug-related issues or lack of mental health support, it might tip it slightly towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
