    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which usually indicates higher risk as people with more criminal history often have more issues or are more likely to become repeat offenders.\n\nShe identifies as White, which might not directly indicate her risk but could be relevant if considering systemic factors, though that's probably beyond the scope here.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem immediately relevant. Maybe she's at a healthy weight given her build, but without context on how it affects her behavior or health, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Being single can sometimes be linked with higher risk of involvement in the criminal system if she feels unsupported or has personal issues that lead to substance use or other risky behaviors.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which suggests she might have academic goals and could be motivated to change her situation, reducing risk compared to someone not studying.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability and reduce the need for criminal activity to support herself financially, indicating lower risk.\n\nDrug use is mentioned\u2014she used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse can be a risk factor as it can lead to unstable behavior or self-harm, increasing risk.\n\nHer recent emotional state feels low might contribute to substance use or mood disorders, which could affect her ability to engage positively with society or make responsible decisions.\n\nLiving at an early age with four people in an urban area could have both positive and negative aspects. Urban environments can offer more opportunities but also may be places where she's exposed to negative influences without support from family.\n\nHer belief that God has nothing to do with her life might suggest a lack of religious support, which some studies link to higher risk of substance abuse and criminal behavior due to a lack of guidance or coping mechanisms for stress.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, emotional struggles, living alone without a strong support network\u2014all these factors point towards a high risk. The confidence level is 90% because each factor significantly increases the likelihood of risky behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
