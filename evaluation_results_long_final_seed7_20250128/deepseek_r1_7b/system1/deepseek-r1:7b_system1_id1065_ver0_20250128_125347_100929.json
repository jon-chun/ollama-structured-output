    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this risk factor step by step. The person is a 20-year-old Black female with two arrests but no convictions. Her lack of college enrollment and recent drug use (cocaine) might indicate substance abuse issues. She's living alone without any income from work or previous relationships, which can contribute to financial instability.\n\nHer past living situation with her biological mother as part of a household of four could suggest family dysfunction, possibly affecting her mental health. However, she says she hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe her coping mechanisms are in place despite the challenging home environment.\n\nConsidering her high school diploma and lack of job experience, she might be facing unemployment, which can lead to financial stress and substance abuse. The fact that she doesn't identify as cisgender but isn't specified could influence her access to support services or societal factors affecting risk.\n\nOverall, while there are some concerning factors like substance use and limited income, the positive indicators like education and lack of recent debt might temper the risk level. Her mental health hasn't indicated depression recently, which is a good sign, but past drug use should be noted.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Arrests and Convictions**: Two arrests but no convictions might suggest inconsistent behavior or lack of prior legal consequences beyond that.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: Past four years of cocaine use indicates potential substance abuse issues, which can be a risk factor for further problems.\n\n3. **Joblessness and Independence**: Currently living alone without income from work or previous relationships could lead to financial instability or isolation.\n\n4. **Family History**: Living with her biological mother in a household of four may indicate family dysfunction but doesn't directly correlate to risk unless combined with other factors like emotional neglect.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: No recent feelings of depression, which is a positive indicator and reduces the risk level slightly.\n\n6. **Education Level**: High school diploma without college enrollment might limit opportunities for support or betterment.\n\n7. **Geography and Identity**: Residing in an unspecified area could affect access to resources, but her Black identity doesn't inherently indicate higher risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nConsidering these points, the overall risk is moderate due to positive indicators like education and mental health but also has concerning aspects such as substance use and limited income. The confidence level reflects a balanced assessment of the given information.",
