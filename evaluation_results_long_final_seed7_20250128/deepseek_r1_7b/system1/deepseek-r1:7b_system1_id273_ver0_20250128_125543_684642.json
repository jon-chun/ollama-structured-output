    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his late teens can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates because of development and life experiences, but it's not always directly linked to crime unless there are specific issues like mental health or substance abuse. His race is White; I don't see any immediate connection to risk here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. A single arrest might be a red flag, especially if he's currently employed and studying. Maybe he's trying to fix his record. Since he's not convicted, maybe he's working on turning his life around, which could lower the risk.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight between 200-224 lbs. That seems a bit on the heavier side but not extremely so. Weight isn't usually the main factor unless there's an issue with eating habits or health problems, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be risky because it increases isolation, which might lead to substance abuse, mental health issues, or domestic violence. Since he has no ties at home, maybe he's more susceptible to negative influences, but since he's studying, perhaps he's focused on positive aspects.\n\nHe's enrolled in school right now. Being a student is generally a protective factor because it can lead to better job prospects and higher education, which often correlate with lower recidivism rates. However, if the school isn't helpful or he's not engaging, that could be a risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs might indicate good financial stability, but maybe he's been laid off recently or working low-hour gigs, which aren't as stable. If he's unemployed, that could increase risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed in a month. These are positive indicators; substance abuse and mental health issues can be significant predictors of future criminal behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. Siblinghood size at home is often linked to higher risk because it can lead to emotional neglect or abuse due to less attention per child. Living with multiple siblings might mean he's getting less individualized care and support.\n\nHe believes that God has something to do with his personal life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs often provide guidelines and values that help in making good decisions. However, it depends on how he applies these beliefs.\n\nPutting this all together: The arrest is a concern but since he's not convicted and is studying, maybe that helps. He's living alone, which is concerning. Multiple siblings might be causing neglect. His substance use history is clean, but his living situation and potential isolation could raise the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```\nThis prediction includes a \"YES\" for high risk with a confidence level of 65%.",
