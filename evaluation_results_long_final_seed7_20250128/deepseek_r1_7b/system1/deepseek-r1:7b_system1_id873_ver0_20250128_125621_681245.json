    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the person described. Let's break down each of the risk factors one by one and see how they contribute.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Being young might mean he's still developing his skills and could be more prone to making impulsive decisions. However, race can also be a factor depending on systemic issues, but without specific information, I'll consider the general factors here.\n\nHe was arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That means there's at least one offense against him that didn't result in a punishment. Maybe he's still working on his mistakes or is considering further involvement. But since it's not a conviction, maybe he's more likely to correct himself than someone with a full conviction.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 165 lbs. I don't know his BMI here, but generally, weight alone doesn't necessarily indicate risk unless there are other factors like if he's sedentary or has health issues.\n\nMarried and living with his spouse suggests he has a stable home environment. Stability can be protective rather than harmful, so this might lower the risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Being without education could lead to unstable job situations, which might increase risk of substance abuse or criminal behavior if not properly supported.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs is generally positive as it can provide stability and financial independence. However, if those jobs are low paying or unsatisfying, that could still pose a risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, even without significant mental health issues, can have negative consequences on relationships and decision-making. Marijuana is not as harmful as other drugs like heroin or cocaine, so maybe this isn't a major issue here.\n\nLiving at an early age with his biological mother in an urban area could provide some exposure to certain environments that might influence behavior, but without knowing more about the family dynamics, it's hard to assess fully.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with his personal events suggests he has a religious background. This can sometimes be protective as people may seek guidance and support from their faith when making decisions.\n\nPutting all this together: He hasn't been convicted, which is a positive sign. He's in a stable living situation with a spouse. Education-wise, he's not completing anything, but that might just mean he hasn't sought it yet or isn't motivated to do so. Having three jobs could be good, though if they're unsatisfying, maybe there's room for improvement.\n\nThe lack of high school diploma is a potential risk factor because it can limit opportunities and lead to risky choices. His recent marijuana use without depression might not be significant enough on its own but could still contribute indirectly.\n\nConsidering his age and race isn't directly pointing towards high risk unless combined with other factors like prior convictions or significant issues in the past, which he doesn't have here.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level because there are positive indicators that suggest stability. However, without a conviction or more serious issues, the risk might not be extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 35\n}\n```",
