    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who's being assessed as a risk assessment expert. Let me break down each factor and see how they might contribute to the likelihood of high risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male Hispanic. Being young can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates because he's just starting out in life, but it also depends on other factors. He's been arrested twice but not convicted. Twice isn't a lot, so maybe that's less concerning than multiple offenses.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs 280 lbs. That makes him pretty hefty. Obesity is linked to higher risk of certain crimes like domestic violence or substance abuse because it can affect his ability to maintain control over his actions. But I'm not sure how significant this factor is compared to others.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse, so he has a stable living situation. That might actually reduce risk since being in a relationship often correlates with lower risk behaviors. Also, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education gaps can be a risk factor because they might lead to unstable employment or substance abuse.\n\nHe's held five jobs during the year, which could indicate some instability if the income varies widely. Unemployment or underemployment is often linked to higher recidivism rates, so having multiple jobs but not necessarily stable ones might be concerning.\n\nHe used cocaine in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can definitely increase risk for further crimes, especially if it's leading to substance abuse problems. Not feeling depressed could mean he's struggling with addiction or using drugs as a coping mechanism, which isn't great.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of seven in an urban area. That's a high number of siblings and living in an urban setting. Larger households can be stressful, especially if there are more people to take care of, leading to dependency issues or behavioral problems that might escalate later on.\n\nHe believes in God but feels there's something from the divine that affects his personal life. While belief in a higher power can sometimes provide moral guidance and reduce criminal behavior, it doesn't necessarily protect against all forms of risk if other factors are problematic.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple factors like past drug use, living with many family members, not having an education, unstable employment history, and a history of arrest could indicate high risk. However, the living situation is stabilizing because he's married now, which might mitigate some risks. The weight and size factor isn't something I know much about, but being heavy can be a risk.\n\nI think there are enough red flags here to consider this as a high risk individual, so my confidence would be around 75%. That means the prediction should be YES with a confidence level of 75.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
