    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factor JSON response for a criminal justice risk assessment. The person is a 19-year-old male, White, with one prior arrest and a conviction. He's described as having no family issues since living alone, which might suggest he's somewhat stable. His education level is high school diploma without college enrollment, which could indicate he's focused or maybe under some stress.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014but hasn't felt depressed recently. That\u2019s interesting because drug use can sometimes lead to other issues, but if he doesn't report depression, it might mean he's managing his situation well. He earned $170 living alone, which is a good income for his age.\n\nFamily history: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That suggests he has a non-traditional family structure and might have experienced some instability or emotional challenges early on. His belief in God could be a strength but also a possible limitation if he's struggling with personal issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, his prior arrest is a red flag, but the lack of depression over the past month is positive. However, living alone at 19 can sometimes indicate he might not have much support for emotional or financial difficulties. The family background could contribute to underlying stressors that aren't evident yet. His drug use history should be monitored closely as it's a potential risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, I think there's moderate to high risk here because of the arrest and possible lack of support system. But without more data on his mental health or living situation beyond the month he reported not feeling depressed, it's safer to lean towards a high risk with lower confidence than if other factors were present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
