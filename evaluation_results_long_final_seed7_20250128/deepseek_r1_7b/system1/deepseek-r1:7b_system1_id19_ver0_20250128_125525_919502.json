    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm looking at this risk assessment query for a 20-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested four times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions; that alone might indicate higher risk because recidivism is a known risk factor.\n\nHis race is White, but I don't think that directly affects risk unless there are systemic issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs 135 lbs. No info on BMI or health issues here, so maybe not relevant for this assessment.\n\nLiving alone suggests he might be dealing with more stressors or isolation, which can contribute to mental health issues, a risk factor.\n\nNever married and living alone could point towards substance abuse problems, which is another risk category.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college: maybe looking for higher education opportunities, but if he's avoiding it, could indicate other issues like drug use or lack of motivation.\n\nHe's held five jobs in the past year. That seems stable, so maybe low to no unemployment, which might be a protective factor, but I need to consider other factors more influential.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with recent heavy use. That's concerning; drug abuse is a strong risk indicator.\n\nHe felt very down for most of the past month without any cheer. That's a sign of mental health issues, which can affect his ability to function and make decisions.\n\nYoung age at 20 living with both parents in a household of four suggests he was raised in an environment that might not be fostering positive relationships or support, possibly leading to issues like substance abuse or neglect.\n\nHe believes God has no role in his life. This could indicate a lack of religious coping mechanisms and possibly other spiritual or emotional support systems missing, which can exacerbate mental health problems.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions, drug use, significant stress from recent life events (like frequent job changes), possible lack of support system, and mental health issues all point towards high risk. The combination is strong enough to say \"YES\" with a high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
