    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female from a White background. Not sure how that plays into risk here, but maybe cultural factors or family dynamics? She's been arrested once but not convicted. That's one negative point, but since it's just an arrest and no conviction, I'm not sure if that's significant yet.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 156 lbs. Her height is average for her age group, and weight-wise, she might be at a healthy BMI range unless she has underlying health issues which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's living alone, never married. Single status can sometimes indicate lower risk factors like lack of domestic issues, but it's also not always the case. Living alone could mean she's responsible or maybe in a safe environment.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, so education level isn't an issue. She's 18 and still attending school is positive; it shows she's focused on her future.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year. Maybe she had part-time work or something temporary. A single job might indicate some instability if it's not a stable gig, but again, not sure yet.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. The mention of feeling down could relate to substance abuse affecting her mood or mental health. I'm aware that substance use can lead to behavioral issues and could increase recidivism risk.\n\nShe's 18 years old, so maybe it's still too early for significant life events, but she does mention that at a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. That might suggest some family issues or environment factors which could influence her behavior and future stability.\n\nShe considers God to be involved in her personal life, so she's religious. That can sometimes correlate with more stable families but also might mean she's less likely to engage in risky behaviors due to strong moral values. However, not all religious individuals are risk-averse; it depends on their upbringing and environment.\n\nPutting this together: The arrest is a minor point without conviction. Her living situation isn't alarming, but her recent feelings of down mood could be linked to substance abuse or personal issues. Her age might mean she's still developing life skills. She's in school, which is positive, so maybe not at high risk from that angle.\n\nHowever, the drug use and feeling low could indicate underlying mental health issues, which often aren't addressed, potentially leading to more risky behavior if not managed properly. The mention of living with her mother might imply some stress or family dynamics that could affect her ability to make positive decisions in the future.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk level. She has a few indicators like drug use and possible underlying mental health issues that can contribute to high-risk behaviors if not properly addressed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
