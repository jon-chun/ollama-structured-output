    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factor JSON response as if I'm thinking through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once but not convicted yet. That means he might have some criminal history despite not having full convictions. Age-wise, being 21 suggests he's still developing socially and legally, which could be a risk factor if he has other negative traits.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 253 lbs. That's quite heavy for his height\u2014overweight can contribute to health issues like diabetes or hypertension, which might affect his overall well-being and ability to manage stress effectively.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone without support from family or friends could increase feelings of isolation and depression, especially since he mentioned feeling down most of the past month. Social isolation is a known risk factor for mental health issues.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Maybe he's looking for more opportunities or stuck without further education, which can sometimes lead to substance abuse or lack of motivation if he doesn't have clear goals.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Having some work experience is positive; it shows he can manage responsibilities and might be self-sufficient enough not to rely on others too much.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to using marijuana in the past four years, but only recently during the last month. Past use doesn't always predict future issues, but recent use could indicate ongoing substance abuse which is a risk factor for other behavioral problems.\n\nFeeling down most of the time points towards depression or low mood, which can affect his ability to function socially and professionally.\n\nFamily background: At an early age, he lived with both parents in a household of five. That's a lot of responsibility and potential stressors that could impact his mental health as he grows older.\n\nHis religious belief about God playing a role suggests he has some spirituality or faith, which can be protective against certain risks but might also indicate other issues if combined with negative behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: While he has no full convictions, his past drug use and current isolation are concerning. He's young and still developing, so any negative traits could have long-term consequences. His heavy weight is a health risk that can't be ignored. The combination of living alone and recent substance abuse might indicate he needs support to improve his mental well-being and social connections.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I would assess him as high risk with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```\nThe analysis indicates a high risk due to factors like past substance use, isolation, weight, and family background. The prediction is made with 80% confidence based on these considerations.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
