    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male from Hispanic background. Age might not directly correlate to risk unless considering criminal history trends. His 7 arrests and prior conviction suggest a history of substance abuse or criminal behavior, which are strong indicators of high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here. No marriage and living alone mean he's an adult making independent decisions, which is neutral but doesn't necessarily lower risk if other factors are present.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education gaps can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, so that's a negative sign for high risk.\n\nOnly one job suggests possible underemployment or lack of stable income, increasing vulnerability to stress or economic issues contributing to risky behavior.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive; consistently abstinence is linked to lower risk. Not feeling depressed over the month also points towards better mental health compared to those experiencing significant emotional distress.\n\nHe was a child in a household of four with his biological mother, which might indicate family support or lack thereof. His religious belief in God could provide stability but doesn't directly influence risk unless he's actively using it to cope with stress.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the person has multiple red flags related to criminal history, education, and potential mental health issues. These together suggest a high likelihood of high risk behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
