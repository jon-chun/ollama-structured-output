    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk. Let's break it down.\n\nThe person is a 22-year-old male from White background, arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s two convictions in his life, which might suggest some criminal history that could impact future behavior.\n\nHe's 6'0\" and weighs 160 lbs. Weight can sometimes be associated with higher risk due to physical health issues, but I don't see any specific factors here related to health.\n\n living alone is a neutral factor; many people live alone these days without it being inherently high or low risk.\n\nNo marriage and living alone again doesn\u2019t directly point to high risk unless there are other factors like substance use. He has a high school diploma and is in college, which might indicate some level of education that could mitigate risk if he's making positive choices.\n\nHe\u2019s employed three jobs during the year; job stability can vary but isn't necessarily a strong indicator without knowing more about his work history or current job situation.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That\u2019s significant because substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism. The fact that he felt down and couldn\u2019t find cheer during the past month adds to this, as chronic emotional distress can be linked to other issues like substance abuse or mental health problems.\n\nHe was living with both parents at a young age in a household of four in a rural area. That might suggest family support but also could indicate some instability if there were issues within that environment. However, it's a bit unclear how that ties into his current risk factors.\n\nHis belief in God not affecting his personal life is interesting. This could be a sign of religion denial or spirituality decline, which might correlate with other behavioral issues or lack of support systems.\n\nPutting this all together: The presence of substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years, along with some emotional distress, points towards potential high risk. The rest of his factors don't immediately jump out as red flags unless we consider how his environment might affect him now. However, considering his history of substance use, especially within the past month when he felt down, it's a strong indicator.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence because of the recent drug use and emotional distress.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
