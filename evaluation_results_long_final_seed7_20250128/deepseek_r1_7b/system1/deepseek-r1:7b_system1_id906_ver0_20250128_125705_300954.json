    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone based on the given criteria. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being young can sometimes be protective against certain risks, but it's not always clear-cut. Being Black might imply some underlying factors, but I don't have information on that yet.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism. So this alone leans towards a high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches, which isn't unusual for a male, so no apparent physical indicator here.\n\nWeight is 165 lbs, but without context on body type or other health factors, it's hard to assess if that's a risk factor. Maybe being underweight could be associated with certain issues, but I don't have enough info.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence behavior, but again, not directly a risk indicator unless there are other factors like substance abuse or unstable relationships.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lack of formal education can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates if someone is motivated to commit further crimes for economic gain or other reasons. But it's also possible that he's seeking alternative avenues, so this might not be as strong.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. Employment history can indicate responsibility and stability. Having multiple jobs suggests a stable income source, which could reduce the risk of engaging in risky behaviors. So maybe this is protective against high risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression in the past month. These are positive indicators as they suggest a stable mental health status, which can reduce recidivism risk.\n\nHe lived at a young age with non-biological parents in a household of three. This could imply exposure to family dynamics or potential stressors that might affect behavior. However, without knowing more about the environment, it's hard to gauge if this is a significant factor.\n\nLastly, he considers God to be involved in his life. Religious involvement can sometimes correlate with lower risk behaviors if there are supportive communities and values that discourage criminal activity.\n\nPutting all these together: prior conviction (high risk), lack of education (possibly moderate risk), stable employment (protective), positive drug use and mental health (protective). The living situation at a young age is neutral without more context, as is his religious involvement. Age is 19, which might be protective but not entirely certain.\n\nI think the prior conviction is the strongest indicator here, so while other factors are mixed or neutral, the presence of a prior conviction would likely push this towards high risk despite some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
