    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for the person described. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, being in his early twenties is generally considered low risk because that's when most people are starting their careers or families, so not a criminal history yet.\n\nHe has a White ethnicity; I know there aren't many studies on racial disparities in recidivism, but generally, it might be linked to socioeconomic factors which could influence his risk level. However, this alone isn't enough to determine high risk without more context.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. So he has a criminal history, which can be significant because arrest is often an indicator of potential issues, even if not convicted. But since he's not convicted yet, maybe it's less severe than someone with multiple arrests or convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are listed: 5'10\" and 180 lbs. I don't immediately see how that affects risk assessment unless there's a specific condition related to his size, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can be a factor because being single might mean he doesn't have the same support network as someone with a spouse or children, but it also depends on other factors like financial stability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education level usually correlates with lower risk since more education often leads to better job opportunities and higher likelihood of successful reintegration into society.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Job experience can be positive as having stable employment history indicates responsibility and reliability, which are good indicators for low risk.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't necessarily a strong indicator unless there's a pattern or if it's leading to negative outcomes like substance abuse disorders. Since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe this isn't as concerning.\n\nLiving situation at a young age: He lived with non-biological parents in an urban area when young. This could be related to family environment and exposure to certain influences which might affect his risk level. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or different social dynamics compared to rural areas.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he has religious support, which is generally protective as having a strong spiritual foundation often correlates with lower recidivism rates due to community support and moral guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: He has one prior arrest, no convictions, so maybe that's not too bad. His living situation at a young age might indicate some instability or exposure, but he's in college, which is a positive sign. His drug use isn't severe as of late, and his belief in God adds support.\n\nI think the factors lean towards low risk, but there are still elements like past drug use and living arrangement that could be areas for concern. However, without more serious issues or higher risk indicators (like multiple arrests, substance abuse with negative outcomes), I wouldn't label him as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
