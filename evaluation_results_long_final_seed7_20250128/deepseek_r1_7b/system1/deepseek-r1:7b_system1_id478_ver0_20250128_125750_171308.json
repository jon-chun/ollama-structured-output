    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which might be associated with certain stereotypes about risk-taking, but I don't have enough information to link her race directly to risk without more context.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a criminal history, which can indicate past behavior that might affect her ability to manage responsibilities now.\n\nShe is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 120 lbs. Her body weight isn't immediately alarming unless there are other factors like low BMI or being sedentary, but with her in college and job experience, she's probably doing okay nutritionally.\n\nNever married and living alone might suggest independence, which could be a positive sign, but it also means she hasn't built social support networks that some people rely on for emotional support during tough times.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending 4-year college shows she has educational goals, which is generally a good indicator of stability compared to those without ongoing education.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Having multiple job experiences suggests adaptability and problem-solving skills, which are positive traits linked to lower risk.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. drug abuse can have serious mental health implications and substance use disorder is often a predictor of more risky behaviors or higher recidivism.\n\nShe felt down for most of the past month, which could indicate underlying mental health issues like depression. Depression is strongly linked to increased risk of various negative outcomes.\n\nLiving with her biological father in a household of three in an urban area might suggest she's experienced family dynamics that could include neglect or abuse if not properly addressed. Her belief in God could be a coping mechanism for stress, but it's also a risk factor as religious coping can sometimes mask mental health issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: a past criminal record, drug use, emotional distress, and possible family environment could indicate a high risk of engaging in risky behaviors or having negative outcomes. The combination suggests she might be at a higher risk than average.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
