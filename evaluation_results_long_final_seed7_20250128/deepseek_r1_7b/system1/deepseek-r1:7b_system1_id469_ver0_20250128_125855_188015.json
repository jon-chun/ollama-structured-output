    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this risk factor indicates a high risk based on the given information. Let me break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 19 might indicate he's still developing socially and emotionally, which could be both protective and concerning for risk factors like substance use or criminal behavior. Being White doesn't inherently make someone a high risk unless there are other systemic issues at play.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That means his criminal history isn't as severe as if he had multiple arrests leading to convictions, which could suggest lower recidivism tendencies. However, it's still an arrest, so there might be underlying issues prompting this behavior.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight is 158 lbs. These stats don't directly relate to risk but could indicate if he's sedentary or not, which might be a factor in other areas like substance use.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living independently can sometimes reduce stress and isolation, but it can also lead to feelings of loneliness unless properly addressed, which ties into mental health factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is linked with lower recidivism rates when he has access to resources or support for further education. Not going to college might mean he's struggling in some area that could lead to substance abuse or other issues if not addressed.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having a job can provide stability and reduce stress, but if he's been unemployed longer, it might suggest issues like substance use or lack of motivation.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is generally less harmful than other substances but can lead to more serious issues as age increases. Since he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe he's managing his use okay for now, which could be a positive sign.\n\nLiving with both biological parents at a young age in a household of five in a rural area. That suggests high family involvement and possible protective factors like love and support. However, it also might indicate living in an environment that lacks diversity or resources, especially if the family isn't providing enough emotional or social stimulation.\n\nBelieving in God's role in his life can be a protective factor as spirituality often correlates with lower risk of criminal behavior. It suggests he has a supportive network beyond just immediate family.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of prior convictions and stable living situation are positive factors, but the recent marijuana use is concerning. He's young, so potential for future issues could exist despite the arrest. Considering his high school diploma and employment history, maybe he's managed to stay on track enough not to commit more serious crimes.\n\nSo overall, while there are some positive signs, the marijuana use and relatively young age might tip the risk towards moderate but not necessarily high. His belief in God is a mitigating factor, which adds some confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
