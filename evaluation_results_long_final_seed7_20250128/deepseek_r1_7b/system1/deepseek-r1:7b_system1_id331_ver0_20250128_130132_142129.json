    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 22-year-old female and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's White, which doesn't directly indicate high risk but might be relevant in some contexts. She has one arrest without a conviction, so that's not a significant criminal history yet. Her physical description is average height and weight, nothing stands out here.\n\nShe's separated and living alone, which can sometimes be an indicator of potential instability or higher risk behaviors if she's vulnerable. Lack of a high school diploma or GED means she might have lower educational support, possibly leading to poorer life choices. Not being enrolled in college could mean she's not seeking help or opportunities.\n\nShe has two job experiences during the year; having some work history is generally positive as it can provide stability and income. However, since she's separated, maybe the job isn't providing her with necessary support.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to using cocaine in the past four years, which could indicate substance abuse issues. Substance use often correlates with poor decision-making and risk behaviors. In the last month, she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up\u2014this might point towards depression or a lack of coping mechanisms, which are significant risk factors.\n\nLiving at a young age with her biological mother in an urban area suggests she may have been raised in an environment without supervision, which can be associated with higher risk of negative outcomes. Believing in God plays a role in some people's mental health and behaviors but isn't directly indicative unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or instability.\n\nCombining these factors: The lack of education, living alone (potentially unstable), recent drug use, emotional distress, and past challenging upbringing all contribute to higher risk. While the job experience is positive, the negative aspects seem to weigh more towards a high-risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
