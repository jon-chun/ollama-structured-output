    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk based on my understanding as a risk assessment expert. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can sometimes be a mitigating factor in some contexts, but being young might mean he's still developing and perhaps has fewer life experiences that could contribute to criminal behavior. Being White doesn't inherently indicate high risk; it could be a protective factor depending on the context.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's one prior offense, which can significantly increase risk because prior convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior. But again, age is 19; he might still be learning from his mistakes.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches, and he weighs 193 lbs. No mention of past or current substance use aside from marijuana in the past four years. He hasn't felt depressed recently either. While weight could sometimes suggest potential health issues, it's not directly linked to criminal behavior unless there are underlying health conditions.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness, which might contribute to substance abuse or other antisocial behaviors. However, without more context on his mental health or social support, it's hard to gauge the risk from this alone.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a key factor; individuals with lower education levels are often at higher risk for criminal behavior due to lack of opportunities and skills development.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide stability and reduce the incentive to engage in illegal activities, so this might actually be protective.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, particularly among young people, is common and doesn't always directly correlate with high risk behavior unless it's leading to more problematic substance use or conduct.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. Cohabiting households and living in urban areas can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates due to lack of control over resources or exposure to negative environments. Urban settings might offer more opportunities for peer influence, which could contribute to risk behaviors.\n\nHe believes in God but feels influenced by personal beliefs. While religious affiliation can provide a sense of direction and purpose, it doesn't necessarily correlate with criminal behavior unless there's a conflict between his beliefs and external influences leading to risky decisions.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest and lack of education are strong indicators of high risk. His age might temper some of that, but given the other factors like living in an urban environment and potential substance use, it leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
