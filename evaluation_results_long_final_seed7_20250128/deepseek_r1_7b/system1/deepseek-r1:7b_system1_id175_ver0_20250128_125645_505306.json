    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old female to determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions; that's already a strong indicator of past problematic behavior which could correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe identified as White. I know there can be disparities in the criminal justice system based on race, but without specific data linking her race to risk factors, this might not directly contribute unless combined with other information.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5'6\" and 115 lbs. While height or weight isn't inherently a risk factor, combined with other factors like drug use, it could indicate certain behaviors, but on its own, it's not telling.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse. Living with someone might reduce some stressors, so this alone doesn't necessarily point to high risk unless there are issues in the relationship or if she's juggling multiple responsibilities which could strain mental health.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. This is concerning because educational attainment is often linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree might suggest she's struggling with life skills, possibly leading her into criminal behavior again.\n\nShe held only one job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substance abuse or other means of survival, which could increase risk of further involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine over four years, with some recent use in the past month. Drug abuse is a major red flag for potential addiction issues, which often leads to unstable behavior and higher risk of reoffending.\n\nShe felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This indicates possible depression or low mood, which can impair judgment and increase impulsive behaviors related to substance use or criminal activity.\n\nHer early life was in a household of two with her biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in an environment where she's raised by her mother might have its own set of challenges, possibly leading to emotional issues if there are conflicts or lack of support.\n\nLastly, she believes that God has nothing to do with her personal events. This could be a sign of spiritual neglect or belief in determinism, which can contribute to feelings of helplessness and increase risk of engaging in self-harming or destructive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (10), drug use history, lack of education, single job, living with spouse who may have issues, recent emotional low point, early family environment, and spiritual beliefs. All these factors suggest a high likelihood of reoffending. Therefore, the risk is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
