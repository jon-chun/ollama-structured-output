    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given this query about assessing risk factors for someone who's a high school graduate living alone, not married, and has only one job. He's Black, 22 years old, 5'7\", weighs between 125-149 lbs. He's never been convicted despite being arrested once. His drug use is past four years (marijuana and cocaine), but he hasn't felt depressed in the past month. He used to live with his mom when he was younger in a household of five, which is quite an intimate setting. He also mentions believing that God has something to do with his life.\n\nFirst off, I need to evaluate each risk factor systematically. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. **Demographics**: Age 22 suggests he's at the prime working age. Being Black might be a minor consideration in some contexts, but without knowing the specific demographic factors of the jurisdiction, it's hard to quantify its impact. However, race can sometimes correlate with socioeconomic status and access to resources, which could influence risk.\n\n2. **Arrest Record**: One arrest but no conviction is a red flag. Arrests indicate prior involvement with the legal system, even if not resulting in a conviction. This might suggest past behavior that could affect future decisions or reliability.\n\n3. **Drug Use**: He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor as it can impair judgment, increase substance use, and potentially lead to further legal issues if continued. However, not feeling depressed now doesn't necessarily negate past behavior or future tendencies.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Arrangements**: Being single and living alone could indicate independence but might also suggest a higher likelihood of facing life challenges such as job loss, which can lead to homelessness or increased risk in the streets.\n\n5. **Education Level**: High school diploma is generally considered average; not being enrolled suggests some level of disengagement with formal education. This could relate to employability and access to resources, both of which might influence risk behavior.\n\n6. **Employment**: Holding one job during the year implies he's employed but maybe not stable or full-time. Job instability can lead to financial strain and increased vulnerability to other negative influences.\n\n7. **Religious Beliefs**: Believing in God could provide a sense of purpose, which sometimes reduces substance use and criminal behavior because there are alternative ways to cope with stress or problems. This might actually lower risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the key points that indicate higher risk are: one prior arrest (even without conviction), past drug use, living alone, being young and from a larger household in an urban area which could mean less supervision, and possibly lower employability due to just having a high school diploma. However, his lack of recent depression isn't a strong mitigating factor.\n\nSo considering all these factors, I think the risk is moderately high but not extremely so. Given that he's at 22, a prime age for positive life choices, perhaps the risk is lower than someone older with similar issues. The one arrest without a conviction might be less impactful if there are efforts to reintegrate him into society or access support.\n\nTherefore, I would lean towards a prediction of \"YES\" but with lower confidence compared to someone with more significant criminal history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
