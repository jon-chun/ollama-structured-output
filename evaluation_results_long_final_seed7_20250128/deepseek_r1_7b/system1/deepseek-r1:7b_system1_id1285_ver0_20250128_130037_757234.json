    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old Black female who was arrested once and convicted. While prior convictions can be a risk factor, it depends on other factors too. She\u2019s of average height and weight\u20145'6\" and 120 lbs, which might indicate something about her health or living situation.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone at such an early age could suggest instability, but without more context, it's hard to say. Her education level: high school diploma with no college enrollment\u2014this might mean she's looking for opportunities beyond her current level, which could be a positive or negative depending on what she's doing.\n\nShe has two job experiences, which is good as job history can show responsibility and financial stability. However, she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't mentioned harder drugs. The recent emotional state\u2014feeling down for most of the past month\u2014is concerning. Emotional distress could impact her ability to function or engage with others.\n\nLiving with her biological father in a household of three from a young age might indicate family issues or potential neglect, which can contribute to risk factors. Her religious beliefs suggest she doesn't see God as a factor in her life, which might imply a lack of support system but could also mean she's more self-reliant.\n\nPutting this together: prior conviction, living alone at 21, emotional distress, and family background are all red flags that point towards high risk. The use of marijuana isn't severe enough to be a major concern unless it's linked to other issues like substance abuse disorders or antisocial behavior.\n\nConsidering the factors, there's a significant likelihood this person could pose a high risk based on her prior conviction, living situation, emotional state, and family background.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
