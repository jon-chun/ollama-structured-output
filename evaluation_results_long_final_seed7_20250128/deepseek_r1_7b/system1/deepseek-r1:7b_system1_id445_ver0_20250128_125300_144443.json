    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to determine if the risk factors provided indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's break down each factor and see how they contribute.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male of White ethnicity. While race can be a factor in risk assessments, it's important to consider other variables too. Being 18 might mean he's still developing socially and emotionally, which could influence his behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests without convictions don't always indicate serious past behavior unless there are underlying issues. Since he's currently enrolled in school, maybe this arrest was a minor offense or related to academic discipline.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 6 inches and weight 130 lbs. While these physical characteristics aren't directly predictive of risk, they might be relevant if combined with other factors like BMI, but there isn't enough info on that here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, which could indicate he's in a stable or somewhat independent situation. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor, especially without family support, but it depends on the circumstances around him.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school suggests he has some educational goals and might be motivated to succeed, which is generally protective against recidivism unless other factors negate that.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having work experience usually shows responsibility and life skills, which are positive indicators for risk reduction. However, if one of those jobs was related to substance use or illegal activities, it could change things, but there's no info on that here.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can have significant implications.Marijuana is generally less severe than cocaine, but both can affect mental health and behavior. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might suggest he's managing substance use without severe mental health issues, but it could also be a result of changing circumstances.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at a young age in a household of six in a rural area. This indicates early exposure to family dynamics and living conditions that might have shaped his behavior. The size of the household can sometimes lead to different types of stressors or support systems, which could influence risk.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal events suggests he's experiencing life challenges without religious guidance, which might impact his coping mechanisms and mental health.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a relatively clean criminal history (arrest but no conviction), is in school, living alone, has some work experience, and moderate substance use. The family background isn't particularly concerning unless there are other issues not mentioned. His lack of religious involvement might be related to substance use or other personal issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors without a high risk of immediate criminal behavior, I would lean towards low risk but with some caution due to potential underlying issues that aren't evident from the provided data.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
