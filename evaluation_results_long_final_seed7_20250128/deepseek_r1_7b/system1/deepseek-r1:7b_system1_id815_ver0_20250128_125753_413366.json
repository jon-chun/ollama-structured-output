    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 21-year-old female to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White, which is a sensitive factor but not necessarily directly indicative of risk without more context. She has a arrest and a conviction, so that\u2019s one negative. However, being only one time doesn\u2019t automatically make her at high risk, but it's something to note.\n\nHer demographics: age 21, single, living alone \u2013 these are typical for someone who might be at moderate risk. Height and weight don't usually factor into risk unless there's a health concern mentioned, which isn't the case here.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Employment history of three jobs is positive; job stability can correlate with lower recidivism rates, so that might be a mitigating factor.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana up to four years ago and hasn\u2019t felt depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes indicate substance abuse issues which could increase risk if there's ongoing use or dependence, but since she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, it might suggest she\u2019s managed it well.\n\nShe was a child raised by her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. That's an unusual background; I'm not sure how that affects risk without more info on family dynamics or support systems.\n\nHer religious affiliation is stated, but I don't know if that has any bearing on risk assessment unless she actively seeks help or there are supportive services available through her church or community.\n\nConsidering all these factors, none of them clearly point towards high risk. The single arrest and conviction aren't strong enough to classify her as high risk without more context about the nature of the offense or her surrounding environment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
