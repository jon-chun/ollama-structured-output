    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age-wise, 18 might be considered a minor, but that doesn't automatically mean high risk. His race isn't immediately alarming unless there are systemic issues, but I don't have information on that yet.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's one arrest, which is significant. If it were a serious offense, maybe, but since it's just an arrest without a conviction, the immediate risk might be lower. But I'm not sure how this plays into the overall risk score.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 0 inches and between 175-199 lbs. That makes him slightly above average in height and overweight, which could relate to health issues or substance use. Overweight individuals might have higher risks for certain health problems, but I'm not sure how that ties into criminal risk.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because of potential loneliness, which might lead to self-harm or other behaviors. But without more context on his mental health, it's hard to gauge the impact here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education level doesn't directly indicate criminal behavior unless there's a history of academic issues, which I don't have evidence for here.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Joblessness can be risky as it might lead to lack of purpose or involvement in illegal activities if he's unemployed actively. However, not having a job alone isn't enough to conclude high risk without other factors like support system or living situation.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning because it can lead to behavioral changes, including criminal behavior if the drugs are causing dependency or impulsivity. The lack of recent depression might not negate this risk entirely.\n\nHe's never been depressed over the past month despite drug use. That's a bit confusing. If he's using drugs and hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe there's a change in his mental health status that could affect his behavior.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of six in a rural area. Large households can sometimes lead to different dynamics, but living with multiple siblings might increase stress or dependency on others. However, since it's a rural area, maybe there are fewer resources for him, which could be another risk factor.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This belief in deity absence might correlate with a lack of religious support or guidance, potentially leading him toward self-identified behavior without institutional backing. However, this alone doesn't strongly indicate high risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the arrest history is notable but not enough on its own. Drug use and living situation are more concerning. The lack of recent depression despite drug use might suggest he's managed his substances better than expected. His living with multiple siblings could imply a lack of support system, which might increase risk behaviors. However, considering he hasn't been convicted yet, the immediate risk is lower.\n\nI'm leaning towards low confidence because while there are some concerning factors like drug use and living situation, without more information on recent behavior or other risk indicators (like prior convictions, longer unemployment spells, etc.), it's not a high enough risk to warrant an immediate YES. But I still think there's enough reason to suggest he might be at moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}",
