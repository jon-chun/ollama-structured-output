    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old male Black individual who's been arrested twice and convicted. His stats are: 6'3\", 270 lbs, never married, living alone, high school diploma but enrolled in college, two jobs, drug use past four years (marijuana/cocaine), and feeling down most of the last month. He lived with non-biological parents in a rural household at a young age and believes God influences his life.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: two arrests and a conviction suggests some instability or prior issues, which could indicate he's been involved in risky environments or has previous negative behaviors. Being Black might be a risk factor due to systemic inequalities, but it depends on other factors too.\n\nHis physical characteristics are quite hefty\u20146'3\"/270 lbs. Could this lead to substance abuse? He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. His mood is described as down most of the last month; he says nothing can cheer him up. That persistent sadness could be a sign of deeper issues, maybe depression or anxiety, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's living alone, which might not protect him from substance abuse or other risks. He's never married and is in college, which suggests he's seeking betterment but perhaps not getting it yet.\n\nThe past living situation with non-biological parents in a rural area could have contributed to behavioral issues; living away from the family can sometimes lead to increased stress or substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe believes in God, so maybe he's seeking spiritual help. However, his current behavior points towards substance abuse and possibly other risky activities.\n\nHis two jobs might indicate some level of responsibility, but if one job is unreliable or if he's facing financial instability due to drug use, that could be a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple past issues, significant weight indicating possible physical risks (but not directly tied), mood issues pointing towards mental health concerns which are known predictors of recidivism. The criminal history adds to the risk. His current situation with job security and living alone might not be protective against further issues like substance abuse.\n\nConsidering all factors, this person seems high risk for reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.

He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
