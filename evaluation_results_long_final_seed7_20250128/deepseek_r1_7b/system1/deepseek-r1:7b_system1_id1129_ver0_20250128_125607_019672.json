Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from a Black background. While race can be a factor in recidivism, it's not always directly linked unless there are systemic issues involved. He has been arrested 18 times but hasn't been convicted yet. That's a lot of arrests; however, if they're all expunged or if he's been working towards a conviction, that might mitigate the risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here. No marital status is neutral\u2014living alone could have different implications, maybe he doesn't have support networks which could be a red flag. He lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college, indicating limited educational opportunities. Not working during the year suggests instability.\n\nHe's used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes lead to other issues like health problems or more drug-seeking behavior, which might increase risk. His living situation with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area could have emotional or social impacts. Lastly, he mentions considering God involved in his life, which is personal and doesn't directly correlate with risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests without convictions, no education, lack of work or support, drug use, and past trauma from living with his mother. These factors lean towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
