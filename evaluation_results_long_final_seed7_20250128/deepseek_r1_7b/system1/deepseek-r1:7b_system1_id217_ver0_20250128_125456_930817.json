    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female of African American descent. There's some research suggesting that Black individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but it can vary based on other factors like support systems and education.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. Incarceration rates are lower for those with only arrests compared to convictions, so this might not be a significant risk factor on its own.\n\nHer height is 5'9\" and she weighs 275 lbs. Weight categories can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to health issues or substance use, but without more context about her health or other indicators like BMI, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nShe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone doesn't inherently increase risk unless there are factors like lack of support networks, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is attending college. Education level typically correlates with lower recidivism rates as higher education can lead to better job opportunities and financial stability.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having at least some steady employment can help maintain stability and reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHer drug use history includes marijuana in the past four years, but no mention of other substances. Substance abuse is a known risk factor for recidivism, especially when combined with other factors like unstable living situations.\n\nThe fact that she felt down during the past month adds to her potential vulnerability or stressors, which could influence her behavior.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Living with multiple family members can sometimes be associated with higher dependency on drugs or other risky behaviors due to lack of supervision.\n\nLastly, she acknowledges a belief in God affecting her life. While spirituality can provide support and reduce recidivism rates, it doesn't directly indicate risk without more context about how that belief is being utilized.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some red flags like the living situation and past drug use, they aren't overwhelming enough to conclusively label her as a high risk without further information. However, considering her age, race, and living circumstances, she might have an increased risk compared to similar individuals with more stable environments.\n\nSo, I'll lean towards \"NO\" but with some caution. Maybe give her around 60% confidence because while there are factors that could contribute to higher risk, without concrete evidence of past criminal behavior beyond the arrest, it's not definitively high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
