    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. \n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age 18 is relatively young, but it doesn't immediately raise red flags unless there are other concerning factors.\n\nShe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's one misdemeanor on her record. Misdemeanors can sometimes indicate substance abuse issues or behavioral problems. \n\nHer physical description: 5'3\" and 140 lbs. While this could relate to a history of abuse, it doesn't directly show any issues unless combined with other factors.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living independently suggests she might have some financial stability or personal responsibility, which can sometimes be a protective factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. This shows some level of education, which could correlate with better decision-making compared to those without an education.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. Having at least one stable job is positive and indicates she's actively employed, which can help prevent further issues.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. The presence of drug use complicates things because substance abuse often correlates with other risk behaviors like criminal impulse or unstable relationships.\n\nDuring some of the past month, she felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. This suggests significant emotional distress or depression, which are strong indicators of mental health issues and potential for substance abuse problems.\n\nLiving at a young age with her biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. This indicates a complex family environment, which can contribute to underlying stressors like neglect, abuse, or poverty that might increase risk.\n\nShe believes God is involved in her life, which typically correlates with lower risk behaviors as it suggests a higher sense of purpose and personal accountability.\n\nPutting this all together: the factors include a past drug use, emotional distress, living in a complex household, and some criminal history. These points suggest she has underlying issues that could pose a high risk. However, since she hasn't been convicted yet and is relatively young with an educational background, it's not an absolute high risk but definitely on the higher side.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
