Let me go through each one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old White female with one arrest but no conviction. That seems like it might not be too bad, but I'm not sure how significant that is yet.\n\nHer height and weight don't immediately raise red flags for me. Maybe if there were health issues or something else, but these numbers alone aren't concerning.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. That's a bit unusual, but not necessarily high risk on its own without more context.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so that's a positive sign.\n\nShe's worked two jobs in the past year. Employment history can be protective too; having some work experience might help her stability.\n\nNo drug use in four years shows she's clean, which is good for risk assessment.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in a month. Managing mental health well is another positive indicator.\n\nHer past living situation: at 17 or younger, lived with non-biological parents in an urban area of three people. That could imply some instability early on, but I don't know if that's relevant now.\n\nHer religious affiliation suggests she has support and a sense of community, which might help her stay out of trouble.\n\nPutting it all together: No prior convictions, stable employment and living situation, positive behavior in drugs and mental health, education, and religious support. These factors generally point towards low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
