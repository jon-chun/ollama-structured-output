    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. The person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male who hasn't been convicted yet but has been arrested once. His living situation includes being married and living with his spouse, which might suggest a stable environment.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college, which could mean he's facing educational challenges that might contribute to substance use or other issues. He only held one job during the year, indicating limited economic stability, which can sometimes lead to dependency on substances as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe has a history of drug use (marijuana) within the past four years. While recent marijuana use isn't necessarily a strong indicator of high risk if he hasn't felt depressed recently, it's still concerning and could be a risk factor. His belief in God doesn't seem directly related to substance use but might influence his personal motivations.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban household at a young age could have provided him with support structures or stressors that might affect his behavior later on. His lack of religious affiliation might not directly correlate with high-risk behaviors, so it's less significant here.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014past arrest, educational and employment challenges, substance use history\u2014the risk assessment should indicate a moderate to high risk. I'll lean towards high risk with an 80% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
