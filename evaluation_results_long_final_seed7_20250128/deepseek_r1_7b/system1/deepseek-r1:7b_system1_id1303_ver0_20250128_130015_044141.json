    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone described. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male of Black descent. Race can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates in some studies, but it's not always consistent across different regions or times. I should keep that in mind but focus on other factors more strongly.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Having a criminal history is a significant indicator of high risk because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses. Each arrest can signal possible substance abuse, unstable living situations, or lack of responsibility towards others.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 8 inches, which is above average but doesn't seem directly related to risk unless combined with other factors like weight. He weighs between 200 and 224 lbs, so he's overweight. Obesity is linked to higher risks of chronic diseases, which can affect mental health indirectly.\n\nHe isn't married and lives alone. Living alone without a support network can lead to isolation and increased stress, which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and doesn't have a GED, indicating educational barriers that could contribute to unstable situations or limited opportunities affecting his stability.\n\nHe has held three jobs in the past year. Unemployment for extended periods is a risk factor, but having some work experience might indicate he's adaptable. However, if it's recent or part-time, maybe not as concerning. But no job history isn't ideal either.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless combined with other factors like substance abuse disorders or unstable mental health.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month, which is a positive sign if we're looking for indicators of risk. Depression can sometimes be linked to substance abuse issues but isn't directly a risk factor on its own.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in such a context might expose him to certain influences or environments that could affect his behavior and mental health.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his personal life. This is more about his spirituality rather than risk factors directly but can sometimes correlate with higher self-discipline if he uses religion as motivation, though it also varies widely.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are a strong indicator of high risk. His lack of education and employment could contribute to unstable living situations. Obesity might be linked to health issues that affect behavior or mental well-being. Living alone without support increases isolation and stress. While his marijuana use is noted, not feeling depressed recently is positive.\n\nConsidering these factors together with some weight towards prior convictions and unstable circumstances, I'd lean towards high risk but not extremely certain because some factors are mitigating like the lack of recent depression and possibly his belief in God's influence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
