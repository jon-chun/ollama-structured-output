    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old male Hispanic individual who was arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which is quite young. Young people often have fewer life experiences and might be more susceptible to making impulsive decisions. But I'm not sure if that's a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic, but I don't know if that significantly affects his risk level unless there's a specific statistic showing Hispanic individuals have higher recidivism rates in this area.\n\nHe was arrested once and not convicted. If it were a minor offense, maybe the impact is less severe compared to a serious crime. But without knowing the nature of the arrest, I can't be sure.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 140 lbs. That's below average, but body type doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are health issues involved, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's living alone, so he has no one to rely on for support or advice during tough times. That could increase feelings of isolation and possibly lead to risky decisions.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he might not have the education needed for stable employment in the future, leading him towards unemployment which is a known risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone adds another layer of dependency on others. If there are no close family members nearby, this could be a significant risk factor.\n\nNot having a college degree can limit opportunities and might lead to lower income levels, which can contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe has one job during the year, but only one \u2013 maybe that's not enough for stability. Job loss could lead him into unemployment or increased reliance on drugs.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. That suggests he might be in better control of his substance use.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month either. A lack of mental health issues can sometimes indicate that he's managing his stress well, but it could also mean he doesn't seek help when needed.\n\nHe was raised in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of three. Growing up in such a setting might influence his behavior towards substance abuse or other risky activities if there are unmet family needs or lack of supervision.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life could mean he's dealing with spiritual issues, which might lead him to turn to other substances like alcohol or drugs as a coping mechanism. This lack of spirituality can sometimes be associated with substance abuse and risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one prior arrest (not conviction), lack of education, living alone, not married, no college degree, working only one job, no drug use in four years, and some negative beliefs about spirituality. These points don't immediately jump out as high risk, but they do have potential vulnerabilities that could lead to risky behavior.\n\nHowever, the fact that he was arrested at a young age without a strong educational background might suggest he's more prone to making impulsive decisions or relying on substances when stressed. His lack of family support and living alone adds to that risk. \n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk assessment because even though some factors are mitigating (like not using drugs), others like being in a household of three without parental supervision, lack of education, and living situation could increase the likelihood of risky behavior.\n\nSo I'd rate this as a \"YES\" with a confidence level around 70%. It's on the higher side because there are several risk factors that could contribute to him seeking or using substances, making unstable living arrangements, etc., which are all indicators of high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
