    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for an 18-year-old female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nShe's been arrested three times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which usually correlates with higher recidivism rates. So that's a red flag pointing towards high risk.\n\nHer race is White, but I don't think race plays a direct role in most risk assessments unless there's systemic bias involved, which isn't indicated here. So maybe this factor doesn't strongly influence her risk level beyond what's already evident from the prior convictions.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Being underweight or overweight can sometimes be indicators of substance abuse issues, especially if she's been struggling with drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Her current weight is within a normal range for her height, so maybe not as concerning on its own.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone increases the risk of isolation, which can lead to substance abuse, mental health issues, or other forms of risk behavior. That adds to the high-risk category.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Being without a high school diploma can result in unstable situations, lack of support network, and higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors like drug use.\n\nShe has held only one job during the year. Unemployment for that long with no attempt to get back into education suggests she might be struggling to find suitable employment or support herself, which could contribute to risk-taking behavior.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine over four years, plus feeling extremely down in the past month. This indicates ongoing substance abuse issues, which are strong indicators of high risk. Substance abuse can lead to various health problems, legal issues, and increased recidivism rates.\n\nShe was living with her biological father in a household of four at a young age. A multi-parent household isn't inherently bad, but if she's had issues there, it might suggest family dysfunction or other environmental factors that could contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHer belief that God has nothing to do with her personal life suggests she may be experiencing religious or spiritual distress. This can sometimes correlate with substance abuse and other risky behaviors as a coping mechanism.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior convictions, drug use, lack of education, unemployment, isolation\u2014all point towards high risk. I think the confidence level should be quite high here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year.

At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
