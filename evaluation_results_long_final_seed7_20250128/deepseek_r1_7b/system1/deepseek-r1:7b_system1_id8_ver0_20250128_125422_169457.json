    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given this risk assessment query, and I need to determine if it indicates a high risk using the specified JSON format. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is an 18-year-old male of White ethnicity. Age might not be a strong indicator on its own, but being quite young could mean he's still developing his decision-making skills. Ethnicity doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are systemic factors at play, which I don't have information on here.\n\nHe has one arrest without a conviction. Arrests can sometimes signal potential issues, but since it's not a conviction, maybe the underlying offense wasn't severe or he might be motivated by personal reasons.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches and weight 159 lbs. These stats don't immediately indicate risk unless there are health concerns associated with them, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situations can affect mental health; maybe living in a stressful environment could be a factor, but it's not directly tied to risk without more info.\n\nHigh school diploma and attending college shows some level of education, which might correlate with better life choices or higher responsibility, reducing risk factors.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment status is positive as it indicates active involvement in society, though having only one job could mean limited economic independence.\n\nDrug use: he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both short-term and long-term effects; however, not feeling depressed might indicate he's managing substance use without severe mental health issues.\n\nHe was raised in a household of five in an urban area at a young age. Larger households often provide more supervision, which could be protective unless there were specific family issues. The fact that it's urban doesn't necessarily imply risk but could influence social dynamics and access to resources or support systems.\n\nConsidering his religious beliefs about God influencing his life; spirituality can provide guidance and reduce stress, which might lower risk factors if he's finding balance through religion.\n\nPutting this all together, the lack of a conviction is a key point. Without a prior offense leading to legal issues, this might suggest a lower risk compared to someone with more significant criminal history. However, being 18 and having only one arrest could also mean he's still exploring options, which might not immediately pose high risk but could change over time.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low confidence level because while there are some negative factors like past drug use and living situation alone, the lack of a conviction and being young could mitigate these. But I shouldn't rule out any potential underlying issues without more information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Arrests**: Only one non-convicted arrest, which is a mitigating factor.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: Past use but no recent depression, suggesting possible control over substance abuse.\n\n3. **Living Situation**: Living alone at 18 could indicate some independence but may not be inherently high risk.\n\n4. **Education and Employment**: High school diploma and attending college suggest responsible behavior and future-oriented mindset.\n\n5. **Family Background**: Raised in a household of five, which might offer protective factors depending on the family environment.\n\n6. **Religious Beliefs**: Considering God's influence could indicate personal stability and balance.\n\nThe combination of these factors suggests lower risk compared to other risk assessment criteria but does not guarantee safety. The confidence is set at 60% due to the mix of mitigating and neutral factors without strong indicators of high risk.",
