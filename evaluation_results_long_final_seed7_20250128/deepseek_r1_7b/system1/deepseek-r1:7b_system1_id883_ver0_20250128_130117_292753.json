    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if this risk factor indicates high risk based on the given criteria. Let's break down each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age-wise, being 19 isn't necessarily a strong indicator of risk, but race can be a factor in recidivism studies, though I need to check if there are any data supporting this here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might show some reluctance to commit serious crimes, which could be a positive sign. However, the number of arrests alone isn't conclusive.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 4 inches and he weighs 170 lbs. This falls within average ranges for his age, so no immediate red flags here in terms of physical indicators.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to isolation, but it also depends on other factors like financial stability or support networks.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is important; not having further education might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior if not supported.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a significant risk factor as it may lead to substance abuse, lack of purpose, or involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed in the last month. These are positive indicators; drug use and mental health issues can sometimes precede more serious behavior if not addressed.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of two in a rural area. Growing up in a supportive environment is generally protective, but rural areas might have different social dynamics that could potentially be negative or positive depending on the context.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. This religious belief can provide a sense of purpose and moral guidance, which typically reduces risk.\n\nPutting all these together: He's young, hasn't been convicted yet, but has some negative factors like unemployment and no college education. His living situation is in a rural area, which might have its own set of challenges, but he's not using drugs or feeling depressed recently. Despite being Black, there isn't strong data here to suggest he's high risk. However, considering the lack of educational support and employment, combined with some minor negatives like single status, I'd lean towards medium risk.\n\nSo, my confidence level is around 30% because while there are factors that could contribute to risk, they don't all point strongly towards a high risk categorization.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
