    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 19 and male, Hispanic. Age might be a factor since younger individuals sometimes have more potential for change. But being Hispanic isn't inherently a risk factor unless there are specific statistics pointing towards higher recidivism in that demographic, which I don't know about yet.\n\nHe's been arrested 11 times and convicted, so that's a significant number of prior convictions. That definitely raises the risk level because more past crimes can indicate problematic behavior patterns or lack of responsibility.\n\nHis height is 5'8\" and weight 210 lbs\u2014though not necessarily high risk on its own unless there are other factors related to health issues, but no info here about that.\n\nLiving alone at age 19 could be concerning because isolation might lead to emotional stress. But again, it's the combination of other factors that matters more.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college\u2014this is a big red flag. Not completing education can lead to unstable situations, lower earning potential, and higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors like drug use or not seeking help for mental health issues.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana) especially recently could indicate underlying mental health issues since cannabis use can be related to depression or anxiety. Feeling down most of the time is another sign; chronic emotional distress might contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lived in a household of five at a young age, which suggests early exposure to multiple family members potentially leading to substance abuse or other family-related issues.\n\nConsidering his religious beliefs (believes in God) could influence his behavior. Some people with strong religious faith might be more disciplined, but without knowing the specifics, it's hard to gauge how that affects risk.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple prior convictions, lack of education, drug use, living situation, and emotional distress are all significant factors pointing towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
