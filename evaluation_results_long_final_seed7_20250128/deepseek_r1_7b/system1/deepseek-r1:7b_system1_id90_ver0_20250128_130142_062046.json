    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 19-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 19 years old, which is young, but that alone doesn't necessarily make him a high risk unless there are other factors. He identifies as White, which isn't directly a risk indicator, so I can note that but not focus on it here.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's important because being arrested without a conviction might mean he faces some level of criminal history, but since he's not convicted, maybe the impact is less severe than someone with a full record. However, one arrest could still be significant depending on the context.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches, which is pretty tall. I don't know if that relates to any risk factors, so I'll move on.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to emotional issues. His current mood seems low; he hasn't felt this way in a while. That could be a sign of underlying mental health issues or stressors in his life.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is attending a 2-year college. Education level usually indicates responsible behavior and the ability to seek help if needed, so that might actually lower the risk.\n\nNot holding any jobs during the year suggests he's unemployed. Unemployment can be a red flag because it often leads to stress or lack of purpose, which could affect mental health. Plus, not having a support system in place since he's living alone adds to the potential risk factors.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years but felt so down for part of the month that nothing could cheer him up. That persistent low mood might indicate depression or another mental health issue, which are significant risk factors on their own.\n\nGrowing up in a household of six with both parents at a young age suggests he was quite stressed and possibly exposed to a lot of environment stressors early on. Urban living can also have its own set of challenges that might contribute to emotional instability.\n\nHis belief in God could be a positive factor, as religious support often aids in mental health recovery. However, it's not a risk indicator either way.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest without conviction is moderate, living alone with isolation and low mood points towards possible mental health issues, unemployment without any attempt to seek help (like looking for work) could be concerning, and growing up in a stressful household adds to the complexity. The lack of a support system due to being single might exacerbate these issues.\n\nI think while there are some mitigating factors like education and religious belief, the combination of living situation, isolation, unemployment, and persistent low mood is more concerning than not. Therefore, I'd lean towards high risk with lower confidence because the factors aren't entirely clear-cut but suggest a potential need for intervention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
