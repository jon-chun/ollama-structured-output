    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who fits this profile. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male of African American descent. I know that race can play a role in recidivism rates, often due to systemic issues like lack of access to education or employment opportunities, but it's not always a direct indicator without more context. So maybe this contributes moderately.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Twice is significant because if he were to get a conviction from these arrests, that might lower the risk. But since he's only been arrested twice with no convictions, it could indicate he's been working on his issues or perhaps is avoiding incarceration. So maybe this isn't as high of a risk.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 188 lbs. Height and weight can be related to body mass index (BMI), which might suggest some level of obesity if BMI is high, but without knowing the reference, it's hard to say. Obese individuals do have higher recidivism rates sometimes due to health issues or substance use problems.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be associated with higher stress levels and social isolation, both of which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors. This could increase the risk a bit.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with lower self-esteem and higher involvement in criminal activities. Not being enrolled suggests he's either avoiding school or maybe has given up, both of which can contribute to risky behavior.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment or lack of employment puts someone at risk of engaging in harmful behaviors like drug use or not seeking help for mental health issues. This is a strong indicator of high risk because joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana specifically) and no recent depression symptoms. Drug use can be a sign of underlying mental health issues or substance abuse problems, which are known to increase the risk of reoffending. Not feeling depressed recently might suggest he's managing his mental health, but if he's been using drugs for long periods, that could be problematic.\n\nHe lived with his biological father in a household of two from a young age. Early experiences at home can influence behavior and self-esteem. Living with one parent might have provided some stability, but it could also suggest limited support network elsewhere, which might contribute to risky behaviors as he grows older.\n\nBelieves in God or sees Him as influential in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide support and guidance, reducing risk if the religion is constructive. However, if there's a history of sin or rebellion, that could increase risk. Here, it's more about the individual's current belief system rather than past behavior.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple factors like being under-arrested (though not convicted), living alone, lack of education and employment, drug use are significant red flags. The presence of any substance abuse or mental health issues can also elevate risk. While some variables like age and race have moderate influence, the combination here leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
