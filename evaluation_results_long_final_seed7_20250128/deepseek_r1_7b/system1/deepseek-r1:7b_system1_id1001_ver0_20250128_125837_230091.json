    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old female of White ethnicity. Age-wise, being 20 isn't typically a red flag unless there are other negative traits. Her ethnicity doesn't directly correlate with risk without more context.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions can indicate past behavior that might put her at risk of reoffending if she's released. But since she's already in custody, this is a significant factor pointing towards high risk.\n\nHer physical description: 5'2\" and 135 lbs. Doesn't seem out of the ordinary; height isn't a direct indicator without knowing if it's above average or related to her past behavior.\n\nShe's never married and living with others\u2014not alone, but again, this is more about current living situation than risk unless she has issues maintaining relationships, which I don't know yet.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor as it might limit her opportunities to avoid negative behaviors. But it's important to consider if this is due to circumstances or genuine lack of interest.\n\nEmployment history: She has held 4 jobs during the year. A reasonable number; having multiple jobs can sometimes reduce recidivism, but if she's unemployed or underemployed, that could be a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. More recently, especially with all feelings down for the past month. This is concerning because substance abuse often correlates with higher risk of reoffending, especially when combined with mood issues like depression symptoms.\n\nLiving situation at a young age: Lived with non-biological parents in a household of five in an urban area. This could indicate instability or neglect, which are known predictors of high-risk behavior and recidivism.\n\nHer belief in God: She considers God to be involved in her life. Beliefs can vary widely; some religious individuals might have higher resilience but others may struggle with mental health issues if there's a lack of support or understanding within the community.\n\nPutting it all together, several factors point towards high risk. The prior convictions, drug use (especially recent), living situation at a young age, and potential instability in her current life all contribute to an increased likelihood of reoffending. Her lack of education might be contributing but is less directly impactful without more context on her circumstances.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" with high confidence because the number of prior convictions, drug use, and living conditions are strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
