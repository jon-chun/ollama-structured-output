    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if this risk factors indicate a high risk for some kind of outcome, maybe criminal behavior or something else? The user mentioned she's 22 years old, White, arrested three times but not convicted. She's 5'2\" and weighs 140 lbs, single living alone. High school diploma but enrolled in college, held six jobs in a year, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed in a month. At a young age, lived with her mom in a small rural household, believes God is involved in her life.\n\nFirst, let's look at her criminal history: three arrests but no convictions. That might be a red flag because more arrests could indicate substance use issues or other underlying problems that led to arrest without conviction. Substance abuse can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, so maybe she's struggling with that.\n\nShe's single and living alone; maybe she's dealing with some personal stressors. She has a high school diploma but is in college, which might show she's motivated to improve herself. However, her employment history: six jobs in a year could indicate she's adaptable or perhaps working multiple low-paying gigs while managing substance use.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a serious issue that can lead to criminal behavior such as theft, violence, or driving under the influence. It might also contribute to other risk factors like lack of stable housing since she's living alone and perhaps struggling with addiction-related issues like debt or neglect.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in a month. If she were dealing with depression, she might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors, but since she isn't feeling it now, maybe that's a good sign. However, past drug use could have led to post-traumatic stress or other mental health issues from her early life.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a small rural household at a young age suggests she might come from a challenging environment. That can lead to issues like substance abuse due to lack of supervision or family dysfunction.\n\nHer religious belief that God has something to do with her life could be a positive factor, as spirituality often correlates with better self-esteem and lower risk of criminal behavior, but it's not always the case. However, if she's struggling with addiction despite believing in God, maybe there are underlying issues that need addressing.\n\nPutting this all together: three arrests without convictions might indicate some behavioral issues or substance use problems. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to various criminal behaviors. Living alone and not feeling depressed recently could suggest she's managing her life better than others, but the past drug use and potential underlying mental health issues are concerning.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high risk because of the substance abuse history and possible underlying behavioral issues from multiple arrests. The employment history is mixed; six jobs might be sustainable but doesn't directly correlate with risk unless it's connected to criminal activity or unstable circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\n\nThis prediction reflects a consideration of the factors indicating potential high risk due to substance abuse history and possible underlying behavioral issues, despite some positive aspects like employment history. The confidence is set at 75% based on the analysis of these mixed signals.",
