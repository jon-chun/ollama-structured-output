    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze these risk factors for determining if this individual is at high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male from a White background. Age seems young, but that might not be directly related unless there's evidence of criminal behavior typically associated with age, which I don't see here.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which usually indicates higher risk compared to fewer offenses.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 9 inches and he weighs 145 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is unless there's a reason to think about weight and recidivism, but it doesn't immediately suggest high risk.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone now. Living situation can sometimes indicate instability or potential substance use issues, which might be related to recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for reoffending because it limits opportunities and self-help resources.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employed individuals generally have lower recidivism rates compared to those unemployed, so having a job might actually reduce risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. While drug use can be a risk factor, not feeling depressed doesn't necessarily negate it; it's possible he hasn't experienced depression recently. However, prior drug use could still contribute to risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive, but his history of drug use might indicate potential for ongoing issues or future mental health problems.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four. Small households can sometimes lead to higher stress or dependency on family, which might affect behavior and risk-taking.\n\nBelieving in God as part of his personal factors is positive; spirituality often correlates with lower recidivism rates because it provides a sense of purpose and direction.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions (3) are high. Lack of education, unemployment, living alone, drug use, and unstable family environment could increase risk. However, having a job might temper some of that. The individual is young but the other factors point towards moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```\nThe person has multiple risk indicators such as prior convictions, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and unstable living situation which collectively suggest a high risk. The confidence level is set at 75% because while some factors may mitigate the risk (e.g., having a job), the presence of several significant risk factors points towards moderate to high risk.\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
