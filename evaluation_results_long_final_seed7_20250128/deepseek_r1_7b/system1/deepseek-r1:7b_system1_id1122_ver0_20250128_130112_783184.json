    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factor as if I'm a criminal justice risk assessment expert. The person is a 20-year-old Black male who was arrested once but not convicted. He's 6'0\" and 160 lbs, single living alone without a high school diploma or GED. He's employed two jobs in the past year but has drug use history\u2014marijuana and cocaine over four years. Recently, he felt really down during the past month.\n\nFirst, his age of 20 is quite young, which might indicate he's still developing socially and emotionally. Being Black could be a risk factor due to systemic issues, but this alone isn't conclusive without more info.\n\nHe has a criminal history, even though it's not a conviction yet. arrested once\u2014could mean unstable home environment or personal issues. His living situation is solitary, which might imply he doesn't have support.\n\nEducation-wise, no high school diploma and not in college shows he lacks formal education, which can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates but also depends on other factors.\n\nHis job history of two shows some stability, though inconsistent. Drug use over four years could indicate substance abuse issues, which is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior or other complications like mental health issues.\n\nFeeling down for much of the past month suggests possible depression or anxiety, which can exacerbate substance abuse and create a cycle of negative emotions leading to higher risk behaviors.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of six adds stress. Small households often have high conflict, which could contribute to emotional instability\u2014something that might translate into criminal behavior if not addressed.\n\nReligious involvement\u2014he believes God plays a role in his life\u2014is somewhat positive but can also be leveraged by delinquents as an escape route or to rationalize criminal acts.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple risk indicators like age, criminal history (even non-convicted), education gaps, drug use, emotional instability from recent feelings and past history, living with a dysfunctional family, and possible mental health issues. These factors collectively suggest a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
