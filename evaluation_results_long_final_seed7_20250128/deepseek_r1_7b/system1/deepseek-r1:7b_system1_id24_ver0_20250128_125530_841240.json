    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for something\u2014presumably criminal reoffending or something else. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a consideration; younger individuals might have more potential, but race can also play a role in recidivism rates, though I'm not sure how much of an impact it has after being convicted before.\n\nHe's been arrested two times and convicted once. That means he has some criminal history, which typically increases the risk of reoffending compared to someone with no record.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and weight is 155 lbs. Not sure how significant these are on their own unless there's an association with body type and behavior, but it doesn't immediately strike me as a red flag.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk of substance abuse or isolation, which might contribute to criminal behavior if not monitored properly.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not finishing high school can correlate with lower educational support systems and potentially more involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs usually indicates stability and higher earning potential, so that might actually be a protective factor rather than an indicator of risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself can be a risk factor for criminal behavior if it's ongoing or leads to other negative behaviors. However, not feeling depressed now doesn't necessarily mean he won't feel the same in the future.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month. A lack of recent depression could indicate better mental health management or maybe he hasn't experienced significant stress that would lead to depression.\n\nAt a young age (22), lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area. Childhood living conditions, especially with multiple biological parents and in an urban setting, can have various implications. Urban environments might offer more opportunities for exposure to crime or risky behaviors. Living with multiple family members could mean less supervision if he's now living alone.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal decisions. This could be a sign of religious fundamentalism or belief in determinism, which might influence his views on behavior and responsibility. If someone doesn't see a higher power as a factor in their actions, it could mean he doesn't seek guidance for criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a criminal history, is potentially unstable due to living alone without supervision, has ongoing drug use, and may lack a strong support system or religious backing. These factors together suggest a moderate risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
