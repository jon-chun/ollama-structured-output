    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate high risk for the person described. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: she's 19, which is relatively young, but she's been arrested seven times and convicted. That's a lot of convictions at such an early age, which could be concerning.\n\nShe identifies as White. I don't know if race plays a significant role in risk assessment here, but it's something to consider along with other factors.\n\nHeight: 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She's underweight for her height, which might indicate some health issues. Underweight individuals can sometimes have weaker bones or muscles, which could affect their ability to perform well in certain jobs.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be isolating and may contribute to feelings of loneliness, which can increase the risk of other mental health issues like depression or substance abuse.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college: this suggests she has some educational background but hasn't pursued further studies. Without a higher education, she might have fewer opportunities for better job prospects and could be more susceptible to certain risks associated with unemployment or underemployment.\n\nShe's held four jobs during the year: holding multiple jobs can provide financial stability, so maybe that's not a high risk factor on its own. However, if she's not stable in her current job, it might indicate past issues.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. The fact that she acknowledges drug use without recent depression could be concerning because substance abuse often co-occurs with other mental health issues.\n\nShe has no history of depression over the past month, which is positive, but considering her drug use, it might still be relevant to look into potential underlying mental health issues.\n\nYoung age and living with her biological mother in a household of four: this could suggest she was brought up in an environment where she had limited influence from her parents or other family members. This could lead to feelings of neglect or lack of support, which can contribute to various behavioral or mental health issues over time.\n\nReligion: She believes God has something to do with her personal life. This might indicate a structured spiritual life but could also suggest she's dealing with other aspects of her life that are causing stress or anxiety.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors like multiple arrests and convictions, drug use, living in a household without much parental influence due to being brought up at a young age, and being underweight could significantly increase the risk. However, since she's 19 and has a diploma, her education might mitigate some of these risks.\n\nI think considering all these factors, the risk is high enough that it should be indicated as \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
