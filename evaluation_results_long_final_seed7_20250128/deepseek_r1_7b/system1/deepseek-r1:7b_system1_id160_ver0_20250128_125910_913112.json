    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the risk factors provided to determine if they indicate a high risk and respond with a JSON object. The person is a 20-year-old male from White background, arrested once but not convicted, stands at 5'8\" and weighs 160 lbs. He's single living alone, has a high school diploma and is in college, has two job experiences, used marijuana in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed recently. He lived with both parents at age 4 in an urban area and doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each factor:\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: One arrest but no conviction. Generally, arrests can indicate potential for further involvement, though one might not be severe on its own.\n2. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana recently but hasn't felt depressed. Drug use is a risk factor as it can lead to substance abuse issues.\n3. **Living Alone**: Living alone at 20 can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors or instability.\n4. **Education and College**: High school diploma and attending college might suggest he has goals, which could be positive but also possibly indicating lack of support in his current situation.\n5. **Previous Home Environment**: Lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area; this might indicate stability initially, but if there are issues now, that's different.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of drug use and potential instability from living alone or past environment could contribute to higher risk without conviction suggesting possible future offenses. The confidence level should reflect moderate risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
