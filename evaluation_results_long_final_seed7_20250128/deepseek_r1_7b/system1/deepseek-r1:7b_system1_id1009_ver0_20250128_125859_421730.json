    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't know how race plays into risk assessment beyond stereotypes, but it's not directly tied here since the focus is on other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested three times but not convicted. That could mean he's a first-time offender or maybe has faced community consequences without getting in trouble with the courts yet. Not sure how that affects risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant unless there's something about his health, but no info is given on that here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Being single doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless he has issues maintaining relationships or is unstable.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school can sometimes lead to lower educational opportunities or higher involvement in the criminal justice system, but again, not directly linked without more info.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs suggests good financial stability and responsibility, which usually reduces risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a sign of substance abuse, which might affect his judgment or behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. No recent mental health issues suggest he's in good spirits, but lack of info doesn't mean there's no underlying issue.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five. That means he has siblings and was raised by multiple people, which could affect his sense of identity or stability.\n\nHe believes God is involved in his life. This indicates a religious background, which can be protective against certain types of risk but might not directly impact criminal behavior unless there's belief in divine forgiveness for past mistakes.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a history of arrests but no convictions, so maybe he's seen as a low risk. His GED and lack of college suggest he's stable. He's living alone, which is normal, and his job history shows he's reliable. No recent substance use or mental health issues, except that he hasn't felt depressed in the past month. His family background isn't unusual.\n\nI think there are no high red flags here. He doesn't fit typical risk categories like being a repeat offender, having substance abuse, or significant mental health issues. So maybe this person is low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
