    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White descent. Age-wise, being 21 isn't necessarily a strong indicator on its own, but her criminal history is important. She has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two prior convictions, which could be significant for risk assessment because recidivism is a known risk factor.\n\nHer physical characteristics are height 5 feet 2 inches and weight 120 lbs. These don't seem to directly relate to risk unless there's some association with her behavior, but they're more about identity rather than risk factors.\n\nMarital status: She's married and living with her spouse. Marital stability is usually associated with lower recidivism rates, so this might be a protective factor that lowers the risk here.\n\nEducation level: She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can sometimes correlate with higher risk because individuals without formal qualifications might turn to substance abuse or other risky behaviors as a result of not having alternative opportunities, which aligns with her drug use history.\n\nEmployment status: She hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can contribute to stress and substance use, both of which are risk factors for various negative outcomes, including more criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a known risk factor, especially since her perception of recent feelings isn't clear on depression, though it's possible she might be using to cope with stress or other issues.\n\nHousehold background: At a young age, she lived with both biological parents in a household of five in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment can have various implications\u2014spatial arrangement and living conditions could affect her development and coping mechanisms. The rural setting might mean less access to resources, which could contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nReligious belief: She believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religious involvement is generally associated with prosocial behavior rather than increased risk, but it's possible that if she experiences stress or loss of meaning, her religious role might change.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors that would increase risk are prior criminal history, lack of education, no job, and substance use. Marital status and household background are protective here. The strength of these risk factors compared to protective ones is moderate. However, since she has a prior conviction and multiple risk indicators pointing towards potential issues, it's reasonable to lean towards high risk but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
