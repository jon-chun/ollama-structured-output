    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old male Hispanic individual who was arrested once and convicted. He's 5'9\" and weighs 195 lbs, living alone without a spouse. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college anymore. He's worked two jobs this year, uses cocaine past four years, hasn't felt depressed in the last month. He lived with both parents at a young age in a household of five urban area and believes God is involved in his life.\n\nFirst, let me break down each factor. Age 20 isn't too concerning yet; it's early adulthood. Hispanic background might not directly correlate to higher risk but could be related to other factors like community support or lack thereof. Being arrested once with a conviction suggests past criminal behavior, which is a significant red flag.\n\nHis height and weight don't immediately indicate much without context on body mass index or previous convictions in specific areas. Living alone points towards possible instability or isolation, which can contribute to substance abuse and other risks.\n\nHe's not married and living alone\u2014maybe that contributes to feelings of loneliness, but he says he hasn't felt depressed recently. Maybe the lack of marital status is just a fact here without further implications on mental health indicators yet.\n\nHigh school diploma and not college might mean limited opportunities or support systems. Working two jobs shows some stability in income, which is positive unless it's tied to other negative behaviors like substance use.\n\nDrug use (cocaine) in the past four years could indicate ongoing substance abuse issues. Not feeling depressed recently suggests he's mentally stable on that front, but substance abuse can have broader mental health impacts.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in an urban area might mean he was raised in a household without strict supervision or support, which can lead to behavioral issues as he grows older. Believing in God could be a positive motivator for behavior change, but it's not directly tied to risk factors unless there are underlying issues.\n\nPutting this all together: past criminal history (arrest and conviction) is a major factor pointing towards high risk. His living situation at a young age could imply instability or neglect, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates. Urban environment might have different support networks compared to rural areas, possibly leading to increased risk factors elsewhere.\n\nHe's not in college but has a diploma\u2014maybe limited educational opportunities that don't contribute positively. His drug use is concerning and needs attention as part of the risk profile. While he hasn't felt depressed recently, past behavior patterns or other indicators (like alcohol use) could still be relevant if considered together with the current factors.\n\nSo considering all these points, his past criminal history, potential instability from living situation, urban environment which might offer more opportunities for negative influences, and substance abuse are significant enough to indicate a high risk. His lack of recent depression might not negate the risks entirely but doesn't provide reassurance either.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
