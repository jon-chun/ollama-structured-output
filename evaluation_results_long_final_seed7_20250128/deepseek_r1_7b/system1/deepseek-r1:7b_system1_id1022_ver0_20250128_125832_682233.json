    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for an 18-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested 11 times and convicted. That seems like a lot of prior convictions. Each arrest can contribute to recidivism risk, so that's definitely a sign pointing towards high risk.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. While race isn't inherently predictive of risk, it could be an indicator in some contexts, especially if there are systemic issues or disparities. However, without more specific data, I'm not sure how much weight to give this on its own.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 6 inches and he weighs 185 lbs. That's a bit on the taller side but within normal range. Weight isn't usually a direct risk factor unless it's significantly above or below average for his age, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk of substance abuse or instability, but without knowing more about his living situation or why he's living alone, it's a bit tricky.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of lower recidivism rates. Not having a degree could increase the risk because there might be less motivation to change behavior after realizing the consequences of his actions.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Having previous employment history, even if it's limited, can indicate some level of responsibility and stability, which might reduce risk compared to someone with no work experience.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of behavioral issues that could lead to further legal problems or instability. It's concerning, especially if it's recent usage as he hasn't felt depressed recently but still uses drugs.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month despite substance use might suggest he's struggling with maintaining sobriety or might have other underlying issues affecting his mental health.\n\nHis early life was in a household of six with his biological mother in an urban area. Growing up in a large, perhaps neglectful environment can lead to behavioral problems and increased risk of criminal behavior as he gets older.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his personal life. While religious belief isn't directly related to risk unless there are cultural or social factors at play within his community that affect him differently.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior convictions, substance abuse, lack of education, living alone, and a history of unstable living conditions (household size six) all point towards high risk. His young age might not be as relevant since he's already been through several arrests and has established some negative patterns.\n\nSo I think the confidence level should be quite high. Maybe around 85% because most factors are pointing toward high risk, but not certain without more specific data or context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
