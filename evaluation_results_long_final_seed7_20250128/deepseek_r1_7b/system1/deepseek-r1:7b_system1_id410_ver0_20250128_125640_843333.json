    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age is typically not a strong indicator of risk unless it's significantly higher or younger than usual for her situation. Since she has only one arrest and hasn't been convicted, that might lower the risk compared to someone with more convictions.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 140 lbs. This doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of weight or height unless it's associated with health issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living independently might suggest she has the resources to manage her well-being without relying on others for emotional support, so this could be a mitigating factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. This indicates some level of education, which often correlates with better job opportunities and higher self-esteem, further reducing risk factors.\n\nShe's held only one job during the year. Employment stability is important; having at least one job can provide a sense of purpose and financial stability, so this might be another mitigating factor.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Substance use can have negative impacts on mental health and relationships, but since she's only in the past four years and not currently using them, it's worth noting that she hasn't been using recently. However, past substance use still raises concerns about potential relapse or ongoing issues.\n\nHer recent feelings of low mood during the past month are significant. Persistent negative emotions can contribute to mental health issues like depression or anxiety, which could increase risk factors if these feelings persist.\n\nShe lived in a household of four at a young age. A larger household might provide more emotional support and stability, but this is speculative since I don't have information on how that affects her current situation.\n\nShe believes in God and considers it to be involved in her personal matters. This religious belief can sometimes correlate with better mental health outcomes if it's a constructive spirituality, but it could also indicate potential barriers or fears related to religion affecting her well-being.\n\nPutting this all together: one arrest, no prior convictions, living independently, some education, recent job experience, past substance use, and feelings of low mood. While there are mitigating factors like living alone and having a recent job, the presence of drug use and low mood could indicate moderate risk. I'm leaning towards \"NO\" with high confidence because she's managed to avoid conviction, is stable in her situation, and has some positive attributes that can offset potential risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
