    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment query step by step. So, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once but not convicted. His stats are height and weight, which don't immediately jump out as red flags. He's unmarried and currently living with someone other than himself, which might indicate some social support or dependency on others.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college, suggesting he might have struggled academically or chose this path without much consideration. He has one job, so employment exists but maybe it's not stable or fulfilling enough to provide direction.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive, showing adherence to substance abuse. His recent mental health, feeling down for some time, could point towards underlying issues like depression or anxiety, which are serious concerns.\n\nFamily history: He was a young father living with his mother in a household of four in a rural area. This might suggest growing up in a challenging environment, possibly with limited resources or support systems that could impact behavior and mental health.\n\nReligious involvement is mentioned; he believes God has a role in his life, which can be positive but may also indicate a reliance on external factors rather than personal resilience.\n\nPutting this all together: One arrest, no conviction\u2014so maybe a risk of reoffending if released. Lack of education could contribute to future instability or substance abuse issues. The mental health concern is a strong red flag for potential high risk behavior. Family dynamics in a rural setting might provide less support and more stressors.\n\nConsidering these factors, I would lean towards high risk but not certain. His mental health issues seem significant enough that the risk level should be noted as high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
