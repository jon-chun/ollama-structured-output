    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this risk factor for a potential high risk assessment. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male with six prior arrests and a conviction. That seems significant because multiple arrests can indicate past trouble, which might be a red flag. Next, his height and weight\u20145'8\" and between 175-199 lbs\u2014but I don't immediately see how that affects risk without more context.\n\nHe's single and living alone, which could mean he's less likely to have support systems that might help him stay out of trouble. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college, so maybe he's not as motivated to improve his situation through education or alternative activities.\n\nHe's employed one job during the year, which is better than being unemployed, but only one job might be insufficient for long-term stability and could lead to financial strain if it doesn't hold up. His drug use history includes marijuana over the past four years\u2014drug use can have serious consequences and might affect his ability to function responsibly.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is interesting because sometimes substance abuse can lead to depression as a reaction. However, he mentions that God has something to do with his life, which could suggest a sense of purpose or religious involvement that might help him stay on track.\n\nLooking at his family background, living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014this might indicate a stable environment initially but doesn't directly correlate to risk unless there are other factors not mentioned. His belief in God could provide moral support and guidance.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (6) and drug use (marijuana) are strong indicators pointing towards higher risk. The other factors like being single, living alone, having a high school diploma, one job, lack of depression, family background, and religious involvement don't necessarily counteract these risks. Therefore, despite some mitigating factors, the presence of six prior arrests strongly suggests a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
