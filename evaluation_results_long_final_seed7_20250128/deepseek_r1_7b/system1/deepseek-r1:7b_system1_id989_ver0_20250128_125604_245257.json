    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for someone who is 19 years old, male, White, arrested once not convicted, 6'3\" and 223 lbs, living alone, with a HS diploma not in college, no jobs, no drug use in past four years, no depression in the last month. At young age lived with both parents in urban area of size 3, considers God involved.\n\nFirst, age 19 is quite young, so maybe less recidivism risk since they're still developing. He's White, but race alone isn't a strong predictor without other factors like systemic issues or discrimination affecting him.\n\nArrested once not convicted: Only one arrest and no conviction might indicate he hasn't faced significant legal consequences for his actions yet. If it's minor, maybe less risk compared to multiple offenses.\n\nHe is 6'3\" and heavy at 223 lbs. Tall and heavy can contribute to health issues but without other health problems or history of violence, this alone isn't a strong risk factor.\n\nLiving alone suggests he might be responsible as an adult, though not entirely. No jobs mean he has no support network which could be a red flag for high risk if there's instability or lack of resources.\n\nHS diploma and not in college: Education level can influence opportunities but not necessarily risk directly unless there are other negative factors like substance abuse or unstable family.\n\nNo job experience during the year might indicate he hasn't sought employment, which could lead to financial instability. But without evidence of unemployment issues, it's a bit mitigating.\n\nNo drug use for four years and no recent depression: Positive indicators that he is stable in terms of substance use and mental health.\n\nHe lived with both parents at an early age in an urban area with three people. This suggests a stable household environment, which might be protective rather than risk-inducing.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the positives like no drug use and stable family background counterbalance some negatives like being arrested once. However, being 19 could mean he's still exploring options, so maybe not as high risk compared to someone with more significant issues or history of substance abuse or other offenses.\n\nOverall, I think the risk is low but there might be a slight inclination towards moderate risk due to potential underlying issues that aren't evident from these factors. So confidence at 30%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
