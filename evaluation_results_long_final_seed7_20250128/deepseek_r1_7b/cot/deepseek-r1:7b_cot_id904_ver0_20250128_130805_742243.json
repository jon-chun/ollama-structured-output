    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. First, let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nThe person is a 22-year-old male of White ethnicity. He's been arrested once and convicted. At that age, only one offense might not be too bad, but it's still an arrest which could have negative implications.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 156 lbs. That seems like normal weight for his height; maybe he's on the lower side. Weight isn't a primary factor here unless there's health issues involved, which I don't see mentioned.\n\nMarried living with his spouse \u2013 being in a stable relationship might indicate good support system, which is usually positive, but relationships can sometimes affect decisions if there are underlying issues not mentioned.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED can be a barrier to getting better opportunities or education, which might influence his future behavior.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Two jobs aren't bad, but with only one arrest and being out of college, maybe he's looking for more stable employment, which could be a positive sign.\n\nDrug use: He used cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Cocaine use can have significant consequences on behavior, leading to impulsive actions or substance abuse issues, which are concerning.\n\nNo depression in the past month \u2013 that's positive, as chronic depression is linked to higher recidivism rates. But recent lack of depression doesn't negate past issues.\n\nYoung age of offense: At 22, it's early, but not necessarily a strong indicator unless there was significant trauma or other factors.\n\nPast household size of three with his religion not playing a role \u2013 that might indicate some level of social support without religious influence; again, could be positive if the environment is conducive to positive behavior.\n\nNow, putting this together. The arrest history, lack of education, limited job experience, and drug use seem concerning. These factors could increase the risk despite other mitigating points like being in a stable relationship and not showing signs of recent mental health issues.\n\nSo, considering all these, I'd lean towards high risk but with some mitigations that might bring it down to medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has one prior arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest which could influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"GED and not in college\", \"low\", \"While having a GED is an educational barrier, not being enrolled in college might indicate a desire for further education which could aid in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Two job experiences in the past year\", \"low\", \"Having two job experiences suggests employability and stability, which are positive factors that may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (cocaine) in past four years\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially recent cocaine use, can lead to impulsive behaviors and substance abuse, which increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No depression in the past month\", \"low\", \"Lack of recent depression is a positive sign as chronic depression has been associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Living with spouse at age 22\", \"medium\", \"Stability from living with a spouse can provide support, but it may also indicate circumstances that could affect behavior if not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"Past household size of three\", \"low\", \"Household size does not inherently increase risk unless accompanied by other negative factors like poverty or neglect.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
