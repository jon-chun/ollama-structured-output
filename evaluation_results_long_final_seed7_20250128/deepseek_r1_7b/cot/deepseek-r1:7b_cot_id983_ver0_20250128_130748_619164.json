    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of this 22-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Young adults often have lower recidivism rates compared to older individuals because they're still developing their skills and life experiences. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. I don't see any inherent racial disparities in recidivism here since the data provided doesn't indicate any specific issues tied to his race, so medium risk.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. A single arrest without a conviction might not have significant consequences yet, especially if he's still young and showing signs of potential change. Medium risk.\n\nHis height is 5'7\" and weight 145 lbs. These are average stats for someone his age, so probably medium risk unless there's an underlying health issue.\n\nLiving alone at 22 could be a bit concerning, but it might indicate independence which can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism if he's self-sufficient. Medium to low.\n\nNo prior marriage and living alone again points towards possible independence or maybe a lack of support system, so medium risk.\n\nHigh school diploma without college enrollment\u2014this is usually seen as positive because education often leads to better job opportunities and stability, which can reduce recidivism. So low risk here.\n\nOnly one job in the past year might be concerning if it's unstable or not leading to much progress, but again, a single job at 22 isn't necessarily bad. Medium risk.\n\nNo recent drug use for four years is a strong positive; substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nHe feels down most of the time and often can't find joy in things. This could be related to mental health issues or lack of engagement with social activities. High risk because chronic depression or low mood can affect judgment and self-control, increasing the chance of criminal behavior.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with both parents\u2014maybe indicating family stability initially but now living alone might mean some challenges. Medium risk as family history isn't a strong indicator unless there's a history of recidivism in the family.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his life\u2014I don't see how this affects risk; it could be a positive or neutral factor, so medium.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest without conviction (medium), no drug use (low), job stability (medium), chronic mood issues (high). The high risk from the mood suggests that despite other mitigating factors, his overall risk is leaning towards higher. So I might predict YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of each factor, here's the structured assessment:\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n1. **Age**: Low - At 22 years old, indicating potential for future positive development and reduced recidivism.\n2. **Race**: Medium - No specific racial indicators affecting recidivism in this case.\n3. **Arrest Record**: Medium - One arrest without a conviction; consequences depend on specifics not provided.\n4. **Height/Weight**: Medium - Average stats, no immediate health concerns noted.\n5. **Living Alone**: Medium - Could indicate independence but might also suggest potential stressors.\n6. **Marital Status/Living Arrangements**: Medium - Single and living alone may point to self-reliance or lack of support network.\n7. **Education Level**: Low - Holds a high school diploma, typically associated with better job opportunities reducing risk.\n8. **Employment History**: Medium - Employed one job in the past year; stability needed for long-term recidivism reduction.\n9. **Drug Use**: Low - No recent drug use over four years, reducing potential triggers.\n10. **Mood/Emotional State**: High - Chronic feeling down and lack of joy could indicate mental health issues affecting judgment.\n\n**Prediction: YES**\nGiven the high risk factor related to mood issues and despite other mitigating factors like education and employment history, the overall risk assessment leans towards reoffending within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"At 22 years old, indicating potential for future positive development and reduced recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"No specific racial indicators affecting recidivism in this case.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without a conviction; consequences depend on specifics not provided.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"medium\", \"Average stats, no immediate health concerns noted.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Could indicate independence but might also suggest potential stressors.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Single and living alone may point to self-reliance or lack of support network.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Holds a high school diploma, typically associated with better job opportunities reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Employed one job in the past year; stability needed for long-term recidivism reduction.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use over four years, reducing potential triggers.\"),\n    (\"Mood/Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Chronically feeling down and lack of joy could indicate mental health issues affecting judgment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
