    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query where the user wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about an 18-year-old male and asked for a relative weight assignment of each risk factor before predicting three-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the factors given: age, race, past convictions, height and weight, living situation, education level, job history, drug use, family background, and religious beliefs. \n\nStarting with age\u201418 is considered high risk because it's early in life but not a full sentence. Race might be low unless there's evidence of systemic issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nNext, no prior convictions mean he hasn't been convicted yet, so that factor would probably be low. Height and weight: 6ft0 with around 199 lbs is taller than average; maybe not a direct risk but could indicate some physical presence.\n\nLiving alone\u2014no family around him to support him, which might increase the risk of reoffending. Education level at high school diploma suggests he's functional but not necessarily getting further education, so that might be low unless it's affecting his job opportunities.\n\nOnly one job held\u2014so maybe some stability, but if he was laid off recently or is underemployed, that could affect future employment and thus recidivism. Drug use: past four years of marijuana and cocaine\u2014substance abuse can lead to more criminal behavior, so high risk there. Not feeling depressed over the past month might be low unless recent trauma led him to avoid seeking help.\n\nFamily background: living with both parents at a young age in a household of six in a rural area could have complex dynamics but perhaps doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it's indicative of abuse or neglect, which isn't stated. Believing God has nothing to do with his life might be a lack of faith, but I'm not sure how that affects risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the high-risk factors are substance use (high) and living alone (medium). The low factors include age being borderline. So overall, I think the risk is moderate, so maybe assign a medium confidence to NO rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is 18 years old, which is relatively young and may not yet indicate a high risk of reoffending, but it's important to monitor for potential behavioral changes.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"The person identifies as White.
