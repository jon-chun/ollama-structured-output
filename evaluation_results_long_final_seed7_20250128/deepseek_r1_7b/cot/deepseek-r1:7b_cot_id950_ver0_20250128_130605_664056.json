    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old female. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst off, she has one arrest but no conviction. That doesn't sound too bad on its own because it's just an arrest without a conviction, which might mean she's actively seeking treatment or hasn't faced legal consequences yet. So maybe this factor is low to medium risk.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 156 lbs. I don't think height or weight usually play a big role in recidivism unless there's something about her body type, but nothing here suggests that. So probably no significant impact on the risk factors.\n\nNext, she's never married and living alone. Living situation can sometimes be linked to stressors like domestic issues or substance abuse, but since we don't have info on that, it might not directly contribute much. Still, it's a neutral factor unless there are other indicators of instability.\n\nShe's enrolled in school right now. Education is generally protective against recidivism because it gives someone the tools and opportunities to improve their situation. So this factor would likely be low risk.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having a job can provide stability and income, which reduces the likelihood of further involvement with the criminal system. This seems like another low-risk factor.\n\nDrug use is mentioned\u2014she used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use itself isn't directly a recidivism indicator unless it leads to other issues, but she's in treatment or seeking help because she feels down, which could be positive. So maybe this is medium risk if she's actively working on it.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area at a young age. Rurality and family structure can influence mental health and substance use. However, without more info on issues like abuse or neglect, it might not directly affect recidivism much. It could be low risk unless there are other negative family dynamics.\n\nBelieving in God is a strong positive indicator for personal morality and support system. If she feels connected to a higher power, that usually correlates with lower recidivism rates because of the support network. So this factor would likely be low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: arrest without conviction (low), education (low), living alone (neutral but not harmful), job (low), recent drug use (medium if she's struggling) and strong family\u4fe1\u4ef0 (low). The strongest risk factors are the recent drug use and maybe the living situation. But since she's in school, working a job, and has no prior convictions, it leans towards low risk.\n\nSo my prediction is that her rearrest recidivism risk is low with high confidence because of all the protective factors outweighing any potential negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest without Conviction\", \"low\", \"Her single arrest does not result in a conviction, indicating she may be actively seeking treatment or facing consequences.\",\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She is enrolled in school and has held a job during the year, providing stability and income potential which reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"neutral\", \"Living alone can sometimes be linked to stressors but without additional info, it does not directly contribute positively or negatively.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"She has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently; however, she is seeking help which could indicate a potential turning point.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a rural household of three provides some protective factors despite the rural setting unless other negatives exist.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Her strong belief in God correlates with a positive support system, often linked to lower recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
