    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White, but I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there's some systemic bias, which isn't indicated here. So maybe that doesn't add much weight.\n\nShe has two arrests without convictions. Arrests can sometimes indicate underlying issues, but since they're not convictions, it might be because of low-level offenses or maybe she's employed successfully elsewhere. Not sure yet how this factors in.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; it's more about behavior and circumstances.\n\nMarried living with her spouse seems stable. Marital status often correlates with lower recidivism rates, so that might actually be a mitigating factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education is generally positive, especially if she's completing it. Not being in school could mean she's focused on work or family, which might help prevent future offenses.\n\nShe has four jobs in a year. Having multiple stable job opportunities usually indicates good economic status and life skills, so that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana specifically. Drug use can sometimes lead to other issues like substance abuse, which could increase recidivism if she relapses. But since it's only marijuana and not hard drugs, maybe the impact is less severe.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in a month. Emotional stability might be related to recidivism rates; avoiding depression could mean better mental health and lower risk of self-harm or acting out, which could lead to more offenses.\n\nLiving with her parents at a young age in an urban area. Being raised in a stable household can provide a safer environment, but if the environment was chaotic or neglectful, it might be worse. The fact that she lived with both parents suggests a supportive background.\n\nBelieves in God and thinks He has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs don't directly predict recidivism unless there's evidence of sin or moral issues within those beliefs, which isn't provided here.\n\nPutting this all together: She has two arrests but no convictions, which might be minor. Stable living situation, education, job history, and positive emotional state seem to mitigate risk. The only factors that could potentially increase risk are the past drug use (marijuana) and possible lack of conviction from prior arrests. However, since she's not in a high-risk group overall, her chances might still be low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without convictions\", \"low\", \"The individual has two minor arrests but no convictions, which may indicate past transient issues rather than significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Marital stability and living with spouse\", \"low\", \"Staying with a spouse suggests a stable environment that could correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education and employment status\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment but actively employed may indicate responsible behavior and future stability.\"),\n    (\"Job history\", \"low\", \"Four job mentions suggest varied and possibly stable employment, which is generally favorable for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana only)\", \"medium\", \"While marijuana use is noted, it's not severe hard drug use, so the potential impact on recidivism might be less significant than harder drug use but still a consideration.\"),\n    (\"Emotional stability\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests positive emotional health, which can reduce risk factors associated with mental illness and substance abuse triggers.\"),\n    (\" household background\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in an urban area at a young age may indicate a supportive family environment that could contribute to lower recidivism risk if the home was stable.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
