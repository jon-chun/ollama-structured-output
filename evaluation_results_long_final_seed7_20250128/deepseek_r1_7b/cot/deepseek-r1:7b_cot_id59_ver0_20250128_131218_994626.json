    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male reoffending within three years. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That's significant because prior convictions are a strong indicator of past behavior that could lead to recidivism.\n\nHis weight is between 200-224 lbs at 5'9\". Being overweight can sometimes be a risk factor as it might contribute to substance abuse or health issues, but without more info on his health, I'll consider it neutral here.\n\nHe's living alone, never married, and currently enrolled in school. Living alone doesn't directly predict recidivism unless there are other factors like lack of supervision, but he's educated so maybe he's managing that.\n\nHe held one job last year; work experience can be both a pro and con depending on the nature. One job might show stability but could also mean he's relying too much on it if he gets fired or loses it.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically cocaine, is concerning. Drug use is a clear risk factor for substance abuse, which can lead to more crimes like theft or violence.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might be a sign of mental health issues that could affect his behavior and future stability.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area. That's a big family, so maybe he had limited supervision at home as a child, but again, without knowing how that affected him now, it's hard to say.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might make him more inclined towards risk-taking behaviors rather than prosocial ones, which could increase the chance of reoffending.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior conviction is high. Drug use is medium. Lack of supervision from a big household might be low but combined with other factors, perhaps medium? His mental health and belief in God are not directly pointing towards recidivism as much as they are away from it.\n\nSo overall risk seems to lean towards Medium because of the prior offense and drug use. The rest of the factors don't add up enough to tip it over to high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as past criminal behavior often leads to similar future actions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, particularly cocaine, is a clear indicator of potential substance abuse which can contribute to criminal behavior and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone/No Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Living alone may offer some stability if managed properly, though the lack of belief in God could suggest risk-taking behaviors that may correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"neutral\", \"Having one job suggests some work experience but without further details on its impact on current behavior or stability, it is considered neutral in this context.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
