    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested three times. He's got a high school diploma but isn't in college, which might indicate some motivation or lack thereof. He only held one job recently and hasn't used drugs in four years, so substance abuse isn't an issue here.\n\nHe's living with someone else right now, not alone, which might suggest some level of support. Not being married could affect his stability. His past was marked by living with his biological mother at age 13, which is a tough start and could have long-term effects on his behavior or decision-making.\n\nHis lack of religious involvement is interesting; maybe that's affecting his personal choices or relationships. He hasn't felt depressed in the last month, so mental health isn't a concern here.\n\nLooking at recidivism, factors like past convictions and living situation are more significant than his current job status or lack of religion. Maybe he's motivated to change but without support structures, it could be risky.\n</think>\n\n**Risk Factors Analysis:**\n\n1. **Past Convictions**: The individual has 3 prior arrests and convictions, which significantly increase the risk of reoffending. A history of multiple offenses often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to prior exposure to the judicial system and potential lack of motivation or willingness to change.\n\n2. **Living Situation**: Currently living with someone other than a parent (though not alone) might provide some level of stability, but without being in a committed relationship, it could be less supportive compared to living with a partner.\n\n3. **Education Level**: Holding only a high school diploma and not currently enrolled in college can indicate lower motivation or commitment towards personal development and self-improvement, which are crucial factors in reducing recidivism.\n\n4. **Substance Abuse History**: No recent drug use for four years is a positive indicator of sobriety, but this factor isn't explicitly mentioned here; if present, it would be a mitigating factor.\n\n5. **Employment Status**: Employed one job during the year might suggest some stability, but only having one job could limit redundancy in income and support systems.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: No depression felt in the past month is positive, indicating current mental health is not an issue.\n\n**Prediction and Confidence:**\n\nGiven the factors analyzed, particularly multiple prior convictions and lack of a strong support system, it's high confidence that this individual may be predicted to rearrest within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has 3 prior arrests and convictions, which significantly increase the risk of reoffending.
