    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has two prior convictions for serious crimes. That's a high risk because recidivism is higher with multiple past convictions.\n\nHe's white\u2014does race play a role in recidivism? I think it does, especially if there are systemic issues or implicit biases, but it might not be as significant as other factors here.\n\nMarital status: he's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can sometimes provide stability, so this might lower the risk a bit compared to being single.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; without education, he may not have the skills needed for better job opportunities, increasing the risk.\n\nHe's employed three jobs in a year\u2014employment itself can be protective if it leads to stable income, but sometimes jumping between jobs might indicate instability.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates because of possible drug-related issues or increased risk-taking behavior.\n\nHe was living with his biological mother at a young age with five people. That's a large household, which might indicate lack of stability or neglect, increasing risk factors like emotional abuse or limited supervision.\n\nHis religious beliefs don't seem to play a significant role in his current decisions.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: high past convictions, no education, drug use, and unstable home environment\u2014these are strong indicators of higher risk. I think the likelihood is quite high he'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has multiple risk factors that significantly increase the likelihood of rearrest:\n\n1. **High Prior Convictions**: Two prior serious convictions raise a high risk due to established criminal history.\n\n2. **Unstable Home Environment**: Living with five people at a young age and currently living with his spouse indicates potential instability, increasing risk.\n\n3. **Drug Use**: Past marijuana use and recent feelings of low mood can contribute to risky behavior, raising the risk.\n\n4. **Lack of Education**: Without a high school diploma or GED may limit future opportunities and increase risk of reoffending.\n\n5. **Employment History**: Employing three jobs in a year might indicate some instability but isn't directly a risk factor.\n\nConsidering all these factors collectively, there's a high likelihood he'll be rearrested within the next three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"high_prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has two prior serious convictions which significantly increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"unstable_home_environment\", \"high\", \"Living with five people at a young age and currently living with his spouse indicates potential instability and neglect, increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years and recent feelings of low mood may contribute to risky behavior, though not directly a risk factor but supportive evidence of high risk.\"),\n    (\"lack_of_education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education or GED is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities for better job prospects and skills.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 225 and 249 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year.
