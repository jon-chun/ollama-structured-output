    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 19-year-old female has a high risk of rearrest within three years. She's White, single, living alone, with a high school diploma and in college. She's not convicted yet but has one arrest. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger adults can sometimes have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing their decision-making skills. But since she has an educational background and is attending college, that might mitigate some risk.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Being single doesn't directly correlate with higher rearrest rates unless there are family dynamics issues, but nothing here suggests she needs help in that area.\n\nHer drug use history: she used cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. The recent drug use might indicate a relapse potential. If she's still using drugs, it could mean she's seeking help or not. Without knowing if she's currently using or seeking treatment, it's a bit tricky, but past use can be a risk factor.\n\nHer living situation: she lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area. That's a stable environment, so maybe lower risk compared to other factors. However, her current living situation is alone, which might indicate she's had challenges before or is unstable now.\n\nShe considers God to have some influence on her life. Religious affiliation can sometimes be linked with higher moral or ethical standards, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee low risk if there are personal issues elsewhere.\n\nThe lack of a conviction despite an arrest is important because convictions carry more weight in predictive models. If she had one, it might show more serious intent, so the absence could mean less immediate risk.\n\nPutting this all together: The most concerning factor seems to be her drug use history. It's recent but not necessarily severe, which might indicate she's still struggling and could relapse. Her age is on the lower end, which isn't a strong positive. The living situation in the past was stable, so that's a minor negative. No conviction adds some weight towards lower risk.\n\nSo, considering these factors, I think her relative risk is medium. She has one risk factor (drug use) that might moderate things but not push her into a high-risk category.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age of 19 years may suggest higher recidivism rates due to developing decision-making skills, but her educational background and college enrollment could mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"She has a recent drug use history, which might indicate potential for relapse but does not necessarily correlate with high risk without further context on current substance use or treatment efforts.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 19 years old could suggest past instability but is mitigated by her stable living arrangement in the past when living with parents.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
