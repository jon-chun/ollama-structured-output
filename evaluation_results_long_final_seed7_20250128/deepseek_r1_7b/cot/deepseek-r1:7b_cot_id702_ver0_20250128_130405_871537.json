    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old female. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals might have lower recidivism rates initially but can sometimes increase it as they get older. She has only been arrested once without a conviction, so that's not much of a risk yet.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant to recidivism unless there's something about her health, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living independently can sometimes be associated with higher stability, but it might also mean she's less monitored or less likely to seek help when needed.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college\u2014she has education, which usually correlates with lower recidivism. Not being enrolled might indicate she's seeking better opportunities.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can provide financial stability and reduce stress, so that's a positive factor but maybe not directly related to rearrest risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years\u2014consistent substance abuse is a strong indicator of high risk, so this is low risk.\n\nHer mood: she feels down for most of the month. This could indicate underlying mental health issues or personal stress, which are significant factors. High levels of depression or anxiety can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors that increase recidivism chances.\n\nShe was raised in a household of seven with both parents at a young age. That's a high risk factor because living in a large, possibly unstable family environment is linked to higher rates of criminal behavior due to lack of supervision or neglect.\n\nLastly, she believes God has no role in her life. This could lead to a more atheistic worldview which might associate with higher crime rates and substance abuse. It can also signal self-reliance but might be linked to risk-taking behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the high family environment and her belief system are strong indicators of potential issues. The other factors like education, stable living situation, job experience, and low drug use balance things a bit. However, given the high family dynamics and possible mental health issues, she's at moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"21 years old individuals may have lower recidivism rates initially but can sometimes increase it as they get older.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has only been arrested once without a conviction, so that's not much of a risk yet.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is less directly relevant to recidivism unless there are issues with supervision or support.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which usually correlates with lower recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Held 3 jobs during the year; having multiple job experiences can provide financial stability and reduce stress.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years; consistent substance abuse is a strong indicator of low risk.\"),\n    (\"Mood/Feeling Down\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down most of the month could indicate underlying mental health issues or personal stress, which are significant factors.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"She was raised in a household of seven with both parents at a young age; living in a large family environment is linked to higher rates of criminal behavior due to lack of supervision or neglect.\"),\n    (\"Worldview\", \"high\", \"Believes God has no role in her life, which could lead to a more atheistic worldview and self-reliance but might be linked to risk-taking behaviors.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
