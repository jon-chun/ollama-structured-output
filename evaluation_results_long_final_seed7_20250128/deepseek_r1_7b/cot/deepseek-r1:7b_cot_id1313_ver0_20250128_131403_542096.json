    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old Black male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two convictions. That's a red flag because past convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses. So that's high risk.\n\nHis age is 20, which is relatively young, but considering his other factors, maybe it doesn't add much here. Probably medium or low weight compared to someone older with more issues.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence behavior; maybe he feels lonely, which could lead to substance use or other issues. So that might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college. Education gaps are often linked to criminal behavior. Not being enrolled might mean he's looking for work or is avoiding responsibilities, increasing risk. Medium again.\n\nNo job in the past year. Unemployment can lead to substance abuse and other risky behaviors. So that's a high factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, but last month he felt really down. That could indicate mental health issues. Mental health problems can contribute to recidivism if not addressed, so medium risk here.\n\nChildhood living with his biological dad in a household of four. That's a family environment which might have had issues. Larger households sometimes correlate with more stress or neglect, potentially increasing risk. So maybe high.\n\nBelieves in God but feels down. While spirituality can be protective, feeling low might lead to other problems. Medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Convictions are the highest, followed by being in a large household and unemployment. The rest are medium. So overall, he's at high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has two previous convictions, which significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with a household size of four may indicate potential stress or neglect that could contribute to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment and Joblessness\", \"high\", \"No job in the past year suggests lack of motivation or responsibility, which are linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for a month without drug use could indicate mental health issues that may affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Childhood Home Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with his biological father in a household of four may have had underlying issues contributing to current behavior patterns.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4.
