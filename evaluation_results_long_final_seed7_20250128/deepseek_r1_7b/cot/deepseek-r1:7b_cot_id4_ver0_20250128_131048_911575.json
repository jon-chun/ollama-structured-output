    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his lack of a high school diploma or GED and not attending college is a red flag. That usually means he might have struggled with education, which can lead to more substance abuse issues later on.\n\nHe's using marijuana in the past four years and has been using drugs recently. Drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing the risk of further substance abuse or more crimes if he starts using other substances like alcohol or opioids.\n\nHis job history shows he held three jobs within a year. While having multiple jobs is positive, it might indicate financial strain or unstable living conditions, which could contribute to substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nLiving alone can lead to isolation and feelings of low self-esteem, especially at a young age when he was in a household of four. This isolation might make him more susceptible to depression and substance abuse.\n\nHis statement that God doesn't play a role in his life suggests he's probably not getting the support or encouragement from a religious community to stay on track with his personal growth and avoiding further issues.\n\nPutting it all together, these factors point towards a high risk of rearrest. His education gaps, drug use, unstable living situation, isolation, and lack of religious support are significant contributors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which may indicate insufficient educational opportunities leading to behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"He has used marijuana and recently felt down due to drugs, suggesting potential substance abuse which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held 3 jobs within a year; while this shows adaptability, it may also indicate instability or economic strain that could contribute to substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone at a young age in a household of 4 could lead to feelings of isolation and depression, potentially influencing drug use and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"He does not believe God plays a role in his life, which may affect social support networks that typically provide guidance against criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
