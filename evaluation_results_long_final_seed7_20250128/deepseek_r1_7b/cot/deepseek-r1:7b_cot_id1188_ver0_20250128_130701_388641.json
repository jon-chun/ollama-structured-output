    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old male having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and convictions. That's a solid red flag. Recidivists are more likely to reoffend if they've had prior convictions because they might have existing habits or reasons to break the law again.\n\nHe's 7 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 177 lbs. That makes him quite heavy, almost double the average weight for someone his height. He doesn't look like he has a typical occupation, so maybe he lives on welfare or something. If he's not employed, it might be harder for him to sustain himself without getting involved in legal issues again.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can lead to loneliness, which is a known risk factor for substance abuse and other behavioral issues that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Without education, he might not have the skills needed for stable employment or managing finances. This can trap him in a cycle of poverty and substance use.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the past year, which is another indicator of lack of stability. Unemployment for an extended period often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it's harder to build a support system.\n\nDrug use history \u2013 he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and felt really down recently. Drug use can lead to impulsive behaviors and self-harm, which might increase his risk of further substance abuse or engaging in risky behavior that could get him into trouble.\n\nHe had a difficult childhood living with his biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Early-life stress from an unstable home environment is a known factor in recidivism. It can affect mental health and social skills, all of which might contribute to criminal behavior later on.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life could mean he's dealing with deep-seated spiritual issues or lack of faith, which might influence his decision-making and relationships, potentially making him more prone to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: four prior convictions are a strong indicator of past criminality. His height and weight suggest he may be struggling financially, leading to welfare dependency. His living situation alone increases risk factors like loneliness and substance use. Lack of education and employment hinder his ability to build a better life. His drug history is concerning and could lead to further issues. Plus, his childhood experiences add stressors that might affect his behavior.\n\nAll these factors together point towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has four prior arrests and convictions, which are significant indicators of past criminal activity and potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Physical Condition\", \"high\", \"The individual's height (7 feet 9 inches) and weight (177 lbs) suggest a possible dependency on welfare or substance abuse, which could influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to loneliness and increased risk of substance abuse, but it is not as directly correlated with recidivism as other factors like prior arrests and employment history.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED indicates potential for limited opportunities and involvement in the criminal justice system in the future.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"No jobs held during the past year may suggest instability, which can be a precursor to further criminal activity or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) along with recent feelings of low mood suggests potential for continued substance abuse and related behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Childhood Experience\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with a household size of two, especially at a young age, may indicate past trauma or instability that could affect current behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is minimal, which might not directly correlate to criminal behavior but can influence self-perception and stress management.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
