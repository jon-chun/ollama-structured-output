    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this risk assessment query for a 20-year-old Black male. He's been arrested three times but not convicted, which is a negative factor because prior offenses indicate higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHis weight and height are noted, but without any info on BMI or potential health issues, it's hard to assess if that contributes to risk.\n\nHe\u2019s living alone, has no family ties beyond his mother from a young age in a large household. That could mean less support system, which is usually linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nEducation-wise, he lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college, so limited opportunities might drive him toward criminal activities as a means of survival or escape.\n\nEmployment history shows he only held one job recently; unstable employment can lead to substance abuse issues if not addressed.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t used drugs in the past four years but felt low for some time. No immediate drug use is good, but feelings of low mood might suggest underlying mental health issues that could affect his behavior.\n\nHis belief in God doesn't directly contribute to risk factors, but it's worth noting as part of cultural considerations.\n\nPutting this all together, despite some mitigating factors like no recent drug use and being in a small household, the prior arrests, lack of education, and living situation all point towards a high risk. Therefore, I\u2019d predict he\u2019s likely to rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted, which is a significant factor in predicting recidivism as prior arrests indicate potential for continued criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"age_and_race\", \"low\", \"Age and race are considered sensitive factors; however, the individual's demographic information does not directly correlate with rearrest rates compared to other risk factors such as prior convictions or living situation.\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"The individual is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 220 lbs.
