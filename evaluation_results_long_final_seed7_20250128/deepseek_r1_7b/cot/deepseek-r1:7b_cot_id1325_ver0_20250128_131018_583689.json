Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's 22 with a high school diploma. Young age might indicate less life experience, which could mean less responsibility or higher impulsivity. But her being married and living with her spouse suggests a stable home environment.\n\nShe has no drug use history, which is positive. No recent depression too\u2014so mental health seems okay.\n\nHer past seven-year household: she lived with both parents in a big urban family. That's a complex environment; sometimes such placements can lead to dependency issues or emotional instability later on.\n\nBut then there are red flags. She has three job transitions, which might indicate unstable employment history. Also, her criminal history\u2014only one arrest but already convicted. That could mean past substance use or other offenses that might affect recidivism rates.\n\nHer lack of college enrollment and high school diploma suggests limited future opportunities and possibly lower socioeconomic status, which can increase risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: moderate risk because of the job instability and criminal history despite some positive factors like no drug use. She's in a stable home but has past issues that could affect her behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 22 years old indicates limited life experience which might suggest lower risk of complex behaviors but also higher impulsivity and potential for substance use if not monitored.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Home Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with her spouse in a stable urban area suggests a supportive environment, reducing the likelihood of adverse influences that could contribute to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest despite being convicted indicates possible substance abuse or other past offenses which can influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having only a high school diploma and not pursuing college suggests limited future opportunities potentially leading to lower stability but also higher risk of dropping out or engaging in risky behaviors if not supported.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding 3 jobs over the past year with no recent substance use or depression suggests stable employment which can contribute to positive life outcomes reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement\", \"low\", \"Staying with her spouse indicates a supportive living environment, which is generally protective against risk factors commonly associated with living in larger households without parents.\",\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Considering God has something to do with her personal life suggests a sense of moral guidance and stability which can contribute to positive behavior patterns reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Job Transitions\", \"medium\", \"Three job transitions suggest potential instability which could lead to increased risk of involvement in risky behaviors or substance use if not properly addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
