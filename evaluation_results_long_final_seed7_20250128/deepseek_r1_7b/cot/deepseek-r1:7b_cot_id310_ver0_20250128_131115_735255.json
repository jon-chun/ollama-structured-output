    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of this 19-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he has one arrest and a conviction. That's significant because prior convictions increase the likelihood of recidivism. So that's definitely high risk.\n\nHe\u2019s 5'8\" and weighs 193 lbs. Weight doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it's related to substance use, which we'll consider later. So maybe low to medium risk based on this alone.\n\nAge is another factor; being 19 is still relatively young, but since he has a prior conviction at such a young age, that's more concerning. So perhaps medium or high? But considering the other factors, it might lean towards medium.\n\nMarital status: he's single and living alone. Living arrangements can influence recidivism because isolation might lead to substance abuse or lack of support. That could be medium risk.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism, especially if it's linked to substance abuse or unstable situations. High risk here.\n\nNumber of jobs held: he has 3 during the year. Having some employment can help with stability and reduce recidivism. Maybe medium to low.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is concerning, especially if it's recent or if there are underlying issues like depression. Medium risk because of the drug use despite no current depression symptoms.\n\nPast living situation: At a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. That could indicate instability or exposure to certain environments that might have contributed to his issues. Could be medium risk.\n\nBelief in God: He thinks God is involved in his life. While spirituality can be protective, if it's inconsistent with past behavior (e.g., drug use), it might not be a strong mitigating factor. Maybe low or medium.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction, lack of education, living situation, and drug use are the most concerning factors. The presence of prior offenses is high risk, while other factors like employment could somewhat mitigate but aren't enough. The overall prediction leans towards high risk with some mitigations, so maybe a 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest and Conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior arrest and conviction significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism due to established criminal behavior and potential underlying issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, especially at a young age, may indicate instability or lack of support which could contribute to substance abuse and other risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can lead to unstable situations and increased vulnerability to substance abuse, which are known risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years indicates potential substance abuse issues that could contribute to further criminal behavior or difficulties in maintaining employment and relationships.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held three jobs during the year suggests some level of stability, which can reduce recidivism risk compared to those unemployed or underemployed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
