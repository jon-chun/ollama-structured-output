    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for this 19-year-old female and then predict her rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's a lot of prior convictions\u2014ten is definitely high. Repeated arrest history suggests she might have ongoing issues with the law, so that's a strong indicator of higher risk.\n\nShe has a GED but isn't in college. Maybe not as concerning unless it affects her ability to get job training or support. But generally, having a GED alone doesn't necessarily correlate strongly with recidivism compared to other factors like prior offenses or substance use.\n\nHer height and weight are given\u20145'4\" and 171 lbs. Not sure how that relates directly to risk assessment unless there's something about her being underweight or overweight affecting her ability, but that seems less likely. So maybe this factor is low.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone.\u5355\u8eab living in a place without support might increase stress or substance use, which are known risk factors. So this could be medium to high.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with recent use in the past month. Substance abuse is a big red flag. It can impair judgment, lead to self-harm, or other dangerous behaviors, so definitely high.\n\nShe felt down for most of the last month, which might be related to substance use or mental health issues. Chronic stress or low mood could contribute to risky behavior, making this another high factor.\n\nYoung age at 19\u2014though she's an adult in terms of legal status but still quite young. Living with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area suggests she might have been raised in an environment that isn't necessarily conducive to positive outcomes. Urban settings can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, so this could be medium.\n\nConsidering God has no role in her life\u2014this indicates she's likely atheist or has a lack of religious support. Without religious guidance, she might turn to other substances or have less structured relationships, which are risk factors. So that's another high factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions (high), substance use (high), current emotional distress (high), young age in urban environment (medium), and lack of religious support (high). The GED and job history don't add much here. \n\nThe prediction would likely be high risk for rearrest. Given the number of high factors, I'd lean towards a YES with very high confidence\u2014maybe 92% as she has multiple strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant arrest history (10 prior arrests and convictions), which is strongly indicative of past problematic behavior that could lead to future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly marijuana and cocaine use in the past four years, including recent use, suggests impaired judgment and potential risky behavior which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress Recent\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of low mood or downness for most of the month may indicate ongoing stress or substance-induced issues, which can contribute to unstable behavior and rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone at 19\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at this young age could be linked to potential isolation or lack of support networks, which might indirectly influence behavior but is less directly indicative of high recidivism risk compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"The individual's lack of religious support and consideration for God may lead to reliance on alternative substances or less structured relationships, increasing the risk of risky behavior or substance use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 92\n}\n```",
