    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which is a minor offense, so that might be low or medium weight. His height and weight are average; maybe that doesn't add much.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so no one to share responsibilities with. That could increase the risk of him getting into trouble again because he's responsible for himself. High school diploma but not college\u2014so maybe less stable education compared to someone who went further? But he only held one job, which might mean he's jobless now.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That\u2019s a red flag; drug abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates. Plus, he didn't feel depressed recently, but that's less relevant than his drug history.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five when young could have had both positive and negative effects. It might influence his behavior or social connections, but I'm not sure how that directly affects his risk here.\n\nConsidering all these factors: past minor offense, living alone, unemployment, drug use\u2014these seem to point towards medium high risk. So, maybe a 50% chance he'll rearrest in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past minor arrest\", \"low\", \"His single non-convicted arrest suggests past behavior without severe consequences, which may indicate low immediate risk but could be a factor in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"unemployment status\", \"medium\", \"Employment instability or unemployment can increase future criminal involvement as it may lead to dependency issues or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"living arrangement\", \"low\", \"Living alone reduces the likelihood of shared responsibilities and potential influence from others, which might slightly lower risk compared to living with someone who could provide guidance or support.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"high\", \"Past drug use in the last four years significantly increases the likelihood of future substance abuse, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household size at young age\", \"low\", \"Household size does not directly correlate with increased criminal behavior but may reflect family dynamics that could influence personal risk factors indirectly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
