    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which is quite young. Young adults often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing skills like self-regulation and decision-making. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe's White, but I don't see any data suggesting race plays a significant role in recidivism for this age group unless there are systemic issues. Since he was convicted once, a recent offense increases his risk as reoffending is common among ex-offenders.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly relevant to recidivism risk, so they probably don't contribute much here.\n\nLiving alone might be a neutral factor since many first-time offenders live with family or friends initially before getting into trouble again. No dependents mentioned either, which doesn't add any risk indicators.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Some education can reduce risk through better job opportunities, but being out of school might indicate instability, though it's not directly tied to recidivism.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Unemployment or underemployment can lead to stress and substance abuse issues, which could increase recidivism.\n\nUsing marijuana is mentioned as both in the past four years and recently. Substance use, especially if it's leading to mood swings or low self-esteem, might affect his ability to manage situations, increasing risk.\n\nHe felt down for a significant portion of the month, possibly due to substance abuse or other stressors. This emotional instability can impair judgment and decision-making.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in an urban area suggests he was raised in a stable environment, which is actually protective rather than harmful.\n\nConsidering his belief in God might relate to personal motivation towards good behavior but doesn't directly contribute to risk factors unless there's evidence of substance abuse or neglect.\n\nPutting it all together: Age is high risk. Conviction and recent drug use are also significant. The rest don't add much positive indicators, so overall, the risk seems high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 21 years old, a young adult who is often associated with higher recidivism rates due to developing life skills and decision-making capabilities.\"),\n    (\"Conviction History\", \"medium\", \"A single prior conviction increases the risk of reoffending as it reflects past criminal behavior which may influence future decisions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Recent\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and feelings of low self-esteem during a significant portion of the month could indicate ongoing substance abuse issues, which can impair judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Employing one job is not necessarily a strong indicator but may suggest some level of stability.
