    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each of the risk factors provided for an 18-year-old male and then predict his rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old White male with one prior arrest and a conviction. That seems like a significant point because being a young adult can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to impulsive decisions or lack of life experience. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nHe is 5'7\" and weighs 155 lbs. Weight alone doesn't usually indicate much in terms of recidivism, but combined with other factors like his living situation could matter. Not sure yet, maybe medium?\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be a risk factor because isolation might lead to substance abuse or other antisocial behaviors. That sounds like a high risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Education level is a known predictor of recidivism; having a high school diploma but no further education could indicate lower self-control or less motivation for positive outcomes. So high risk here too.\n\nNo job during the year, which might mean he's unemployed or underemployed. Unemployment can lead to lack of stability and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors. High risk factor.\n\nDrug use past four years, specifically marijuana. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential for relapse and continued behavior that could cause recidivism. Definitely high risk.\n\nHe felt down most of the past month; maybe indicative of mental health issues or substance abuse. This can be a sign of underlying problems that might contribute to recidivism. High risk factor.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of four. Young families often have higher conflict rates and less stability, which could lead to issues like drug use or antisocial behavior. High risk.\n\nDoesn't believe in God; could relate to higher levels of stress or substance abuse if religion is a coping mechanism. Could be high risk.\n\nPutting this all together, most factors point towards high risk except maybe the height and weight. But considering he's 18 with multiple prior factors like drug use, unemployment, no job, living alone, etc., I think his recidivism risk is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of criminal behavior, which is a significant indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and household\", \"high\", \" living with biological parents in a household of four at a young age may indicate family dysfunction and increased risk factors such as substance abuse or neglect.\" ),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \" Drug use history, particularly marijuana, is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential for relapse and related behaviors.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \" Lack of employment can lead to instability and increased likelihood of engaging in risky or destructive behaviors that may contribute to recidivism.\" ),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \" Living alone increases the risk of isolation, which can lead to substance abuse or other antisocial behaviors that may result in further criminal behavior.\" ),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \" Persistent feelings of low mood and depression, possibly due to mental health issues or drug use, can contribute to substance abuse and unstable behavior leading to recidivism. \"),\n    (\"\u6559\u80b2_level\", \"high\", \" Having a high school diploma but not pursuing higher education may indicate lower self-control or motivation for positive outcomes, increasing the risk of recidivism.\" ),\n    (\"no_job\", \"high\", \" Not being employed can lead to economic instability and increased stress, which are known predictors of recidivism. \"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
