    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 20-year-old female. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's Black. There have been studies showing that being Black can correlate with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and racial bias in the justice system. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. While one offense isn't severe by itself, it does indicate some prior involvement which could predict higher chances of reoffending.\n\nHer age is 20. Young adults often have more flexibility and less life experience compared to older individuals, but they're also more susceptible to making impulsive decisions that could lead to recidivism.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 172 lbs. That makes her underweight for her height. Being underweight can be a sign of malnutrition, which might affect her overall health and ability to make responsible decisions.\n\n living alone is another point. Living with family reduces the risk compared to living independently because there's more support available during tough times.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but is in college. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism rates as it provides better opportunities and skills, so maybe this lowers her risk slightly.\n\nShe held three jobs in the past year. Job instability can be linked to higher recidivism because unemployment or changing jobs can strain personal relationships and increase stress, leading to substance abuse or other impulsive behaviors.\n\nHer drug use: she used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself is a risk factor for reoffending, especially if it's followed by incarceration which can lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month, which might suggest she's managing her mental health better than someone who does. However, recent drug use could be a red flag as substance abuse often correlates with recidivism.\n\nHer young age of living with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area suggests she experienced a sheltered environment without much exposure to stressors or criminal influences. This might actually lower her risk compared to someone who grew up in an unsupportive environment.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors that lean towards high risk are being Black, having a prior conviction, living alone (though that's mitigated by her education and college), drug use, and past unstable living situation. The positive factors like education, not feeling depressed recently, and rural upbringing balance some of these out but aren't enough to negate the higher risks.\n\nConsidering all this, my prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level around 65% because the negative risk factors still significantly outweigh the mitigating ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black identity\", \"high\", \"Systemic issues such as over-policing and racial bias in the justice system correlate with higher recidivism rates for Black individuals, contributing to a high relative weight.\"),\n    (\"One arrest and conviction\", \"medium\", \"While one offense is not severe on its own, it does indicate prior involvement which can predict higher chances of reoffending, providing a moderate relative weight.\"),\n    (\"Age 20\", \"high\", \"Young adults often have more flexibility and less life experience compared to older individuals, but they're also more susceptible to making impulsive decisions that could lead to recidivism, carrying a high relative weight.\"),\n    (\"Underweight (5'2\"/172 lbs)\", \"medium\", \"Living underweight can be a sign of malnutrition, which might affect overall health and ability to make responsible decisions, offering a moderate relative weight.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"Living with family reduces the risk compared to living independently because there's more support available during tough times, providing a low relative weight.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and college enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Education generally correlates with lower recidivism rates as it provides better opportunities and skills, offering a moderate relative weight.\"),\n    (\"Three jobs in past year\", \"high\", \"Job instability can be linked to higher recidivism because unemployment or changing jobs can strain personal relationships and increase stress, leading to substance abuse or other impulsive behaviors, carrying a high relative weight.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana only in past four years)\", \"high\", \"Drug use itself is a risk factor for reoffending, especially if followed by incarceration which can lead to more criminal behavior, providing a high relative weight.\"),\n    (\"No recent depression feelings\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month might suggest better mental health management compared to someone who does, offering a low relative weight.\"),\n    (\"Young age and rural household\", \"low\", \"Experiencing a sheltered environment without much exposure to stressors or criminal influences lowers risk despite past unstable living situation in a small household, providing a low relative weight.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
