    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. That might be a red flag because even if convictions aren't on his record, it could mean he's struggled with the legal system before. Maybe that history indicates some issues with accountability or law enforcement.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 170 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics directly affect recidivism risk unless there's something about his weight management or health, but since he hasn't felt depressed in a month, maybe he's stable.\n\n living alone: Unstable living situations can lead to stressors that might contribute to criminal behavior or substance abuse later on.\n\nHigh school diploma and not college: Maybe he doesn't have the skills needed for better opportunities, which could increase the risk of engaging in similar risky behaviors again.\n\nHe held one job during the year. A recent job might indicate some stability, but if it's a low-paying or unstable position, that could be a warning sign.\n\nNo drug use in four years: That's positive and should lower his risk compared to someone who uses drugs regularly.\n\nNot feeling depressed over a month: Emotional well-being is important; consistent mental health can affect decision-making.\n\nYoung household size of five: At a young age living with more people might have had different dynamics, but I'm not sure how that affects his personal stability or behavior now.\n\nBelieves in God: Religious factors don't typically directly influence recidivism unless there are underlying issues like coping mechanisms or substance abuse related to religion.\n\nPutting it all together... The lack of convictions and positive drug use are good signs. However, the two prior arrests could indicate past issues that might affect his ability to avoid similar crimes now. Living alone and being only 21 might mean he's still forming stable relationships, which isn't great. His education level is a bit concerning because it might limit his opportunities for positive development.\n\nI'm leaning towards a medium risk here. The factors are mixed\u2014some negatives but also some positives that could balance each other out. I don't see him as high risk, but he's not low either. Maybe around 40-50% confidence in a rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"The individual has only two arrests without convictions, which might suggest past difficulties with the legal system but no clear criminal history that could directly predict future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can be isolating and may increase stressors that could potentially lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment might indicate limited opportunities for positive development, which could influence risk factors but is not directly indicative of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Holding one job may provide some stability, though employment status alone does not predict recidivism.
