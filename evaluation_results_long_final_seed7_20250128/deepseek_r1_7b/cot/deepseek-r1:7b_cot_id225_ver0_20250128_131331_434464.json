    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has two arrests but no convictions. That might be a red flag because if they're not convictions, maybe the charges were dismissed or he didn't complete any programs. So that could be a medium risk factor because it shows some trouble without immediate severe consequences.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 170 lbs. I don't know how his weight relates to recidivism directly unless there's something about his health, but the info given doesn't mention any issues with weight or health problems. So maybe this is low risk.\n\nHe's living alone, not married, so no family support which could be a medium factor because sometimes being supported can help reduce recidivism, but if he's on his own, it might increase stress and other issues leading to more offenses.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Being without an education is a significant risk. Without proper skills, he might struggle with finding employment or making good life choices. That should be a high risk factor because education is crucial for positive outcomes.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Having recent unemployment could indicate instability. If he's lost his job and isn't retraining, that could lead to dependency on drugs or other activities which can increase recidivism. So this is probably a medium-high risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, but some month he felt down all the time. That could be a sign of underlying mental health issues. Chronic stress might make him more prone to substance abuse or other risky behaviors if it's untreated. This seems like a medium risk factor because while he doesn't use drugs now, there's a history of feeling down which could affect his mental state.\n\nAt a young age, living with three people in the household. That's a large family size, but unless there are significant issues within that household, it might not directly correlate to recidivism. So maybe low risk here because bigger families often have more support and resources compared to smaller ones.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. That's actually positive for risk assessment because religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and stability. So this is low risk as it indicates strong personal values that might prevent reckless behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: two arrests (medium), no high school (high), one job (medium-high), living alone (medium), mental health history (medium), family size (low), and religious belief (low). The high factor here is the lack of education. \n\nI think the overall prediction would be YES with a high confidence because despite some mitigating factors like living alone, having no education puts him at a significant risk. However, the only strong positive is his religious belief which might help a little. So maybe 72% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Two arrests without convictions\", \"medium\", \"Having two arrests but no convictions could indicate past trouble that may not have led to significant consequences, raising concerns about potential future behavior changes.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\", \"high\", \"A lack of education often correlates with higher risk of recidivism due to limited opportunities and skills for positive outcomes.\"),\n    (\"One job held during the year\", \"medium-high\", \"Recent unemployment can signal instability, potentially leading to dependency on substances or risky behaviors as he seeks employment again.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase stress and isolation, which could contribute to substance use or risky activities if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Mental health history of feeling down\", \"medium\", \"A history of chronic stress without drug use might suggest underlying mental health issues that could affect behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Family size of 3 at a young age\", \"low\", \"Larger family sizes often provide more support, which may help in preventing risky behaviors and maintaining stability.\"),\n    (\"Believes God has something to do with his life\", \"low\", \"Strong religious beliefs can offer a sense of purpose and moral guidance, potentially reducing risky behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
