Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. That seems young, but she's still a minor, so maybe it affects her ability to commit serious crimes. But since she's only had two arrests without convictions, maybe her behavior isn't severe enough yet.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant here; I mean, they could be factors in some other assessments, likeJuvenile Detention Board evaluation, but not sure about recidivism risk.\n\nNever married living alone might suggest she's focused on herself or has limited support network. That could potentially reduce her chances of getting involved with the system again, so maybe a lower risk factor.\n\nGED and not in college\u2014maybe she's seeking better opportunities, which is positive. She only held one job last year, but if it was stable, that might be a good sign too. Plus, no drug use for four years seems like a solid indicator of responsible behavior.\n\nShe doesn't feel depressed recently, so mental health isn't an issue here. Good.\n\nLooking back, at a young age she lived with her biological mother in a small urban household. Maybe she's somewhat detached from family now, but it could also indicate she was raised in a controlled environment which might be protective against certain crimes.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think the risk is low because most of the red flags are either not present or mitigating ones.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor for the 19-year-old female:\n\n- **Age**: 19 years old. This suggests she may still be focused on personal growth and development, potentially reducing recidivism risk. (low)\n- **Drug Use**: No use in the past four years. This indicates responsible behavior, which is protective of recidivism. (low)\n- **Mental Health**: Not feeling depressed recently. Positive indicator for stability. (low)\n- **Living Situation**: Living alone without a family connection. May indicate self-reliance and reduced risk factors. (low)\n- **Education Level**: Holds a GED but not in college. Indicates pursuit of personal development, which is favorable. (low)\n\n**Prediction**: NO  \nShe has no significant risk factors that would predict recidivism within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 19 suggests she may be focused on personal growth and stability, reducing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates responsible behavior and self-discipline.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month.
