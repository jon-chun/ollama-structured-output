    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query where the user is asking for a risk assessment on an 18-year-old female. Let me try to break down what's going on here.\n\nFirst off, she's white, which might not be directly relevant, but her demographic info could play into systemic factors. She has two arrests but no convictions, so maybe she's under some supervision or at risk of reoffending because of past behavior without consequences.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and 140 lbs\u2014nothing immediately jumps out there about her physical health or anything related to substance use in this context beyond the note that she used marijuana. Her job history is three jobs, which isn't stellar but maybe not a major red flag yet.\n\nHer drug use history: she's used marijuana before but specifically mentioned using it in the past four years and some of the time in the last month. She feels down often, suggesting possible substance abuse or mental health issues. That might point towards her struggling with coping mechanisms, which could influence her decision-making when involved with law enforcement.\n\nLiving situation is interesting\u2014she's 18 and living with her spouse in a household of six in a rural area at a young age. That's a lot of people under one roof in a rural setting, so maybe there are family dynamics or social support that might either help or hinder her ability to make good decisions now.\n\nHer religious affiliation is noted as something that influences her personal circumstances. She believes God has something to do with her life, which can sometimes correlate with more stable behavior or resilience against recidivism, but it's not a sure thing.\n\nNow, thinking about risk factors: age and race are minor here except for systemic issues possibly related to being arrested twice without convictions\u2014could be a sign of chronic under-arresting. Her living situation in a big household might indicate lack of supervision or support, which can contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nHer job history is moderate, but substance use and recent negative mood could be higher risk factors. The fact that she's 18 suggests she's still developing judgment, which makes her more susceptible to impulsive decisions leading to recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several risk factors: past arrests without convictions, living in a large family, substance use, and emotional distress due to recent drug use. These points might push the prediction towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Past Arrests (2 times) but No Convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of arrests, which may indicate prior involvement with the criminal justice system and potential for future reoffending.
