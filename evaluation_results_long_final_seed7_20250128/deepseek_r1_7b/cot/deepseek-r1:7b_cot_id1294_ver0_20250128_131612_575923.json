    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for a 20-year-old male who's Black. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which is a minor offense. His height and weight don't seem relevant here; maybe they could factor into something else like confinement, but probably not directly affecting his risk.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so no partner to support him in case of recidivism. No kids mentioned either. He has a high school diploma, which is lower than most college graduates, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism compared to someone with more education or maybe less education.\n\nHe's worked four jobs in the past year, so he's somewhat stable and employed. That might help him avoid getting into trouble again. But his drug use history is recent\u2014marijuana over the past four years. Drug use can be a significant factor because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to increased risk of other crimes or self-harm.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might indicate he's mentally stable enough to handle his situation without major issues. But depression itself is a risk factor too, so maybe this isn't directly relevant but shows some resilience.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five people. That means he grew up in a multi-parent household, which is often associated with lower recidivism rates because there's support and fewer family issues that could lead to problems later on. So this might actually be protective rather than a risk factor.\n\nHis religious beliefs are mentioned\u2014he believes God has something to do with his personal events. This could imply he has some level of control or motivation, which might be positive, but it doesn't directly indicate a high risk unless there's evidence of neglect or abuse elsewhere, which isn't provided here.\n\nPutting this all together: Minor offense, stable living situation, job history, no kids, high school diploma, four jobs\u2014these are all somewhat protective factors. However, the recent drug use (marijuana) is a red flag because substance abuse can lead to more serious offenses or self-harm, which could increase recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these points, I think he's in a low risk category but with some moderate factors that might slightly raise it. Maybe medium overall. But since the recent drug use isn't too severe and he seems mentally stable, perhaps pushing towards low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Minor Offense History\", \"low\", \"Having been arrested once but not convicted suggests a minor offense history which is generally less predictive of recidivism compared to more severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"Stable Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a spouse indicates a stable living environment, which can reduce the likelihood of exposure to triggers that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in the past year suggests moderate stability and financial independence, but it does not directly correlate with lower recidivism risk compared to those with fewer job histories or varied work experiences.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma, which is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to individuals with less education or non-institutionalized education (e.g., GED).\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Four jobs in the past year suggests job experience and financial stability, reducing the risk of involvement in the criminal justice system again.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years is a significant factor.
