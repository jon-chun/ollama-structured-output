    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this 20-year-old female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her race is White. I don't think that typically affects recidivism rates in most places, but it's good to note.\n\nShe has a criminal history with two arrests and a conviction. That alone should be a significant risk factor because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHer age is 20, which might mean she's still developing her skills, so that could be medium or low? Maybe medium since being young can sometimes be a mitigating factor but not always if she has a history.\n\nShe weighs 135 lbs and is 5'2\". Weight isn't usually a big factor unless there are health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nNot married and living alone. Living arrangement could affect support systems, maybe medium risk since being single can lead to more stress or isolation.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education level is definitely a strong indicator\u2014she has low education, which typically correlates with higher recidivism.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Unemployment for that long could mean she's struggling financially, so maybe medium risk because job instability can lead to other problems.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't in the last month when feeling low. That might be a point of consideration\u2014recent sobriety could be positive, but past misuse still counts.\n\nYoung age at which she lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. This could involve family dysfunction or exposure to a chaotic environment, which is medium risk because it's not the worst but still concerning.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious factors can sometimes influence behavior, maybe reducing risk slightly if she's seeking help or guidance.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions are high, education and employment status are negative, drug history is present but recent. The living situation isn't ideal. So overall, her risk of reoffending seems high.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has a significant criminal history with prior convictions, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending. Her lack of education and unstable employment also contribute to the risk. Despite recent sobriety from drugs, the presence of past misuse should still be considered. Her living situation in an urban area with non-biological parents may suggest underlying family issues that could impact her ability to reintegrate successfully.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has a history of two arrests and one conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Her lack of high school diploma or GED places her at a higher risk compared to individuals with more education.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in the past year, albeit without a degree, could indicate some instability which may affect future stability and reoffending risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Despite recent sobriety from drugs, past misuse still poses a risk of relapse or engaging in similar substance abuse behavior, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with non-biological parents in an urban area may suggest challenges that could impact her ability to reintegrate into society successfully and avoid further criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
