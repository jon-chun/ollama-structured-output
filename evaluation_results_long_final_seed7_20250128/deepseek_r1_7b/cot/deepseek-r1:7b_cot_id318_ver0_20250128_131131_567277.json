    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female from being rearrested within three years. She's Asian/Pacific Islander, not convicted yet but has one arrest. She's 5'2\" and 145 lbs. Living alone, not married. Enrolled in school currently. Worked four jobs in the past year.\n\nShe used drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years. In the last month, she felt really down and couldn't find joy in anything. She lived with both parents when young, in a household of three in an urban area. She believes God influences her life.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the factors from the query to analyze each one.\n\n1. Age: 21. Young age might mean less criminal history but also more potential for positive development.\n   \n2. Race: Asian/Pacific Islander. I remember that certain ethnic groups have lower recidivism rates, so this might be a mitigating factor.\n\n3. Number of arrests: 1, not convicted yet. So she's in the system but hasn't been formally sentenced or received any convictions.\n\n4. Height and weight: Not sure how relevant these are to recidivism risk; maybe they don't directly influence it unless there's something about her physical state affecting her mental health, which isn't indicated here.\n\n5. Marital status: Never married. Unmarried individuals might have different life circumstances that could affect recidivism rates, but not sure if this is a high factor.\n\n6. Living situation: Alone in an urban area. Being alone can sometimes correlate with higher stress levels and substance use issues, which are linked to recidivism.\n\n7. Employment status: Currently enrolled in school. Education can be a positive predictor of lower recidivism as it may lead to better job opportunities and self-sufficiency.\n\n8. Job history: 4 jobs in the past year. Some job instability might increase risk if she's frequently changing, but four jobs is a good number for stability unless she had issues with each job that led to substance use.\n\n9. Drug use: Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism; heavy drug use can lead to more criminal behavior or self-harm, which could increase risk.\n\n10. Emotional state in the past month: She felt so down that nothing could cheer her up. Emotional distress might be linked to substance use issues and lower self-esteem, all of which can contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\n11. Past home environment: Lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area. A stable home environment is usually associated with lower risk factors, but if there were any issues or neglect noted (not mentioned here), that could change things.\n\n12. Religious belief: She believes God influences her life. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective by providing moral guidance and support, which might decrease recidivism rates.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- The drug use is a high risk factor because it's both frequent and recent, linked to substance abuse issues.\n- Emotional distress in the past month is also high; it could indicate deeper mental health issues that aren't being addressed.\n- Being in school is positive but perhaps not directly mitigating unless she has academic support or encouragement from family.\n- The single living situation might correlate with higher stress and substance use, so medium risk factor.\n- The drug use and emotional distress are the main concerns. Other factors like her age, race, education, and religion are less concerning compared to these.\n\nSo overall, I think there's a high relative weight for each of the key risk factors: drug use, emotional distress, and living situation. Without more data on any mitigating factors (like family support, mental health services), it might be safer to predict rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young, indicating less criminal history and potential for positive development.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Asian / Pacific Islander background may be associated with lower recidivism rates due to cultural factors and community support\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One non-convicted arrest could indicate prior exposure but not necessarily a strong criminal history\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"These metrics do not directly correlate with recidivism risk without additional context\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Not married may suggest different life circumstances, though not directly linked to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone in an urban area could be associated with higher stress and substance use issues\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"Currently enrolled in school might indicate some level of dependency or instability affecting employment opportunities\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Four jobs suggest past stability, though frequent job changes can increase risk if accompanied by substance use issues\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use, along with recent distress, strongly correlates with substance abuse and potential criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of deep down despair could indicate substance abuse or low self-esteem, both linked to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Home Environment\", \"low\", \"Stable home environment at a young age generally reduces risk factors unless neglect is noted),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may provide support and reduce risk compared to those with no religious involvement\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
