    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 20-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of 5 arrests and 4 convictions. That's a significant number, which usually points towards higher risk because more past offenses often mean more likely to commit new ones.\n\nHis age is 20, which might be a positive factor since younger individuals can sometimes have different motivations or circumstances compared to older adults. But given the number of prior arrests, that might not outweigh other negative factors.\n\nHe's identified as White. I'm aware that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased enforcement, but this is a sensitive area. Without more context on how his race specifically affects him here, it's hard to assign a weight.\n\nHis height (6'0\") and weight (165 lbs) don't directly relate to recidivism risk unless there are health concerns that might affect his ability to work or contribute, but since no such info is provided, I can ignore this for now.\n\nHe's living alone. Living in a single unit doesn't necessarily correlate with higher risk on its own, but it could be an indicator of possible isolation leading to increased stress or substance use issues, which are linked to recidivism.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and isn't in college, which might mean he has limited opportunities and could turn to alternative pathways like drugs. This is a red flag for higher risk.\n\nHe's employed 4 jobs over the year but doesn't specify if they were stable or if he faced issues at work. Unstable employment can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors, increasing recidivism chances.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years is a strong indicator of current substance abuse. Substance use not only affects personal health but also mental state, which could influence his ability to make responsible decisions or handle stress effectively.\n\nHe felt down for much of the past month, possibly due to drug use or other stressors. This emotional instability might lead him to engage in risky behaviors that increase recidivism.\n\nAt a young age (20) living with 4 people suggests he was part of a household where his actions could have significant consequences on others but doesn't directly indicate personal behavior. However, if the household dynamics were unstable, it could contribute to his current issues.\n\nHis belief in God might influence his motivation or decision-making. While religious beliefs can be protective sometimes, without knowing how that affects him specifically, it's hard to quantify its impact on recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrest and conviction records (high), lack of education (high), living alone (medium), drug use (high), unstable employment (medium), emotional instability due to past month's feelings (high). So the overall risk is high. Therefore, I would predict a \"YES\" for rearrest within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 5 arrests and 4 convictions, which indicates a significant criminal history that often correlates with higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be an indicator of possible isolation or stress, which may influence substance use and risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate, coupled with not being enrolled in college, suggests limited opportunities that may lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, along with feelings of low mood during the past month, points towards substance abuse issues which are strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Unstable Employment\", \"medium\", \"Employment of 4 jobs without details on stability or performance may indicate potential barriers but does not directly correlate as strongly with recidivism risk as other factors like drug use.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Instability\", \"high\", \"F frequent feelings of low mood and depression-like symptoms, possibly due to substance use, can lead to risky decision-making behaviors that increase the likelihood of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
