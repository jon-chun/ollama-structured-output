    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess the risk of this 20-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White with two arrests but no convictions. I know that race can sometimes influence recidivism rates, though it's not the only factor. Her two arrests might indicate some past behavior, so maybe medium risk from that.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 120 lbs. Weight alone doesn't seem too significant unless there's more context about her health or living conditions, which I don't have here. So perhaps low impact on this risk assessment.\n\nNot married and not currently living alone is interesting. Single status can affect recidivism because support networks might influence whether she'll seek help or maintain sobriety. But since she's single but not necessarily in a disadvantaged situation, maybe medium risk from that.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment usually correlates with lower recidivism as higher education often leads to better job opportunities. So this factor might actually reduce her risk, which could be low weight here.\n\nNo job experience during the year is concerning because employment can provide stability and reduce the chances of engaging in criminal activities. However, if she's not actively seeking help or considering alternative avenues, maybe a slight medium weight.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse can contribute to recidivism, especially if it leads to other illegal activities or self-harm. Since she hasn't felt depressed lately, maybe the risk isn't as high here, so perhaps low impact despite the drug use.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area suggests she might have some support but also live in conditions that could be stressors, like poverty. Urban areas can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or social issues which might affect recidivism. So maybe medium risk from living situation.\n\nShe considers God to have influence on her life. Religious factors can provide moral support and accountability, potentially reducing recidivism if she's actively seeking help. Therefore, this could slightly reduce her risk, so low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: two arrests (medium), living with mother in urban area (medium), not married/living alone (medium), drug use (low), no job (medium). The high school diploma is a positive that might lower the overall risk. \n\nConsidering these factors collectively, she has some risk factors but also protective ones. With all this, I think her predicted three-year rearrest recidivism is low to medium. But considering the arrest history and living situation, it's leaning towards medium. Maybe 58% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Two arrests with no convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has two prior arrests but no convictions, which could indicate past behavior that may influence future actions.\"),\n    (\"Living in a household of size 2 in an urban area\", \"medium\", \"Living situation in an urban area with a small household may present certain challenges that could potentially impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Not married and not currently living alone\", \"medium\", \"Single status without living arrangements might affect support systems, which can influence both protective and risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma and not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Educational background is often associated with lower recidivism rates as higher education typically provides better job opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"No job experience during the year\", \"medium\", \"Lack of employment may lead to instability, which could potentially increase risk factors if linked to other negative behaviors or activities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 58\n}\n```",
