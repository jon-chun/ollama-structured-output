    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of this 19-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 19 with a high school diploma but not in college. Younger individuals often have more time to develop skills or find better opportunities, so maybe her education isn't the biggest red flag here. She's not enrolled in college, which might mean she's looking for something else, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism.\n\nShe has a criminal history with three arrests and two convictions. That seems significant because prior convictions are a strong indicator of reoffending. But I should also consider the nature of her previous crimes\u2014were they violent or minor? The information given doesn't specify, so maybe it's safer to assume they could be related to substance abuse since she hasn't used drugs in the past four years.\n\nShe lives alone and has never been married. Living alone can sometimes lead to isolation, which might contribute to mental health issues or stressors that could lead to relapse. But again, without knowing her circumstances, it's a bit of a guess.\n\nHer lack of employment is another point. She held two jobs in the past year, so she has some work experience. Maybe this stability helps prevent rearrest. The fact that she feels down and couldn't find cheer might indicate underlying issues but isn't directly linked to recidivism unless she's struggling with substance abuse.\n\nShe was a child in a household of four from an urban area. That environment could have had both positive and negative influences. Urban areas sometimes offer more opportunities or exposure to crime, which might correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nReligious involvement is noted, so she has some support system. That's generally protective but depends on the nature of her religious involvement.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a history of criminal behavior (high), she lives alone which could be stress-related (medium), and maybe her employment status is moderate. Her education isn't showing any specific risk factors, so I'm leaning towards medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"high\", \"She has a history of three arrests and two convictions which are significant indicators of potential reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to isolation leading to stress or substance abuse issues, though more context is needed.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs in the past year suggests some stability and ability to manage personal affairs which may reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
