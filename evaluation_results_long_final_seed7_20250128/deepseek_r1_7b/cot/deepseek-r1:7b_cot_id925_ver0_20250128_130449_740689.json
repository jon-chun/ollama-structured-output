    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 18-year-old male has a high risk of rearrest within three years. He's White, hasn't been convicted yet, but he's got one arrest. Let me go through all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is still quite young. Usually, younger individuals might have more potential for reoffending because they're still developing. So that could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. That might not directly relate to criminal behavior but could indicate he's focusing on school or other positive activities. Not sure if that affects recidivism much, maybe low.\n\nHis height and weight aren't factors here; it's more about behavior than physical attributes. So probably a low impact.\n\nHe held one job during the year, which is good because unemployment can lead to substance use or other issues. That might be a medium factor since having some work experience could indicate better life choices, but if he was underemployed or facing issues, maybe it's high? Hmm, not sure yet.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of possible relapse or more substance use. That would definitely push his risk up to high.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's interesting because sometimes substance abuse can lead to depression, but he's not experiencing it now. Maybe that suggests he might be trying to manage the drugs differently? Or maybe he's in a good mental state despite the drug use. This is a bit conflicting\u2014on one hand, he uses drugs, which could lead to more issues, but on the other, no recent depression.\n\nFamily background: He lived with both biological parents when young in a household of three. That seems stable and positive; maybe that's a low risk factor because being in a stable environment can prevent issues.\n\nLastly, his belief in God: He thinks God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might relate to his spiritual support system or his mindset about life. Not sure if it affects recidivism directly but could influence his behavior indirectly. Maybe it's medium because if he doesn't rely on a deity for support, he might have different coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use is a high risk factor. The age and family background are medium. The arrest is low. Unemployment or work experience isn't directly related but maybe has some influence. No recent depression could be mitigating some factors, but the main issue is the drug abuse. So overall, his risk of rearrest seems high because of the substance use.\n</think>\n\nThe individual's recidivism risk is assessed based on several factors:\n\n- **Drug Use**: High (He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years)\n- **Employment**: Medium (He held one job during the year)\n- **Age**: Medium (18-year-old, still developing)\n- **Family Background**: Low (Lived with both parents in a household of three)\n\n**Prediction**: NO\n\n**Confidence**: 75%\n\nThe primary concern is his recent drug use, which significantly increases the risk. Other factors like age and family background contribute but are secondary to the drug abuse issue. Despite no recent depression, the ongoing substance use is a major mitigating factor.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one non-convicted arrest, which may indicate prior stable behavior despite legal issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding one job during the year could suggest some level of dependency or focus on work, though it doesn't directly correlate with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use is a significant risk factor for substance abuse issues that can lead to relapse or further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of three suggests a stable environment, which may not directly correlate with recidivism but could influence coping mechanisms.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"medium\", \"No recent depression over the past month might suggest he is managing substance use differently or maintaining a positive mindset despite previous issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
