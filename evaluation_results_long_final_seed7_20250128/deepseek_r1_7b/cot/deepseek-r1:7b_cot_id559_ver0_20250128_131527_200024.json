    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he has been arrested three times with two convictions. That's a significant indicator of past behavior issues. Repeating offenses increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nNext, his personal circumstances: living alone and never married can sometimes indicate higher self-reliance or lower stress from relationships, but it also means fewer social support systems which might contribute to substance use or other unstable behaviors.\n\nHis education level is high school diploma only and he's not in college. Not continuing education could mean limited opportunities for positive development or access to resources that might aid in turning his life around.\n\nEmployment history: he held two jobs but it doesn't specify if they were stable or profitable. Unemployment can lead to dependency on substances as a coping mechanism, which is a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to marijuana use and felt low for the past month. Substance abuse, especially if it's a coping mechanism, can impair judgment and increase recidivism chances.\n\nPast living situation at a young age with seven people: That was probably an stressful environment that might have contributed to his current behavior issues.\n\nReligious belief in God: While religion can provide moral guidance, it doesn't necessarily mitigate criminal behavior unless there's consistent support for positive actions. Without evidence of such support, it's not a strong mitigating factor but also not a risk indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor points towards higher risk. Multiple convictions, unstable living situation, limited education, job instability, drug use, and past stress all contribute to a high likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"High due to three arrests and two convictions indicating past behavior issues which may influence future criminal tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Personal Circumstances\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married, while not directly a risk factor, may contribute indirectly through potential lack of support systems which might lead to increased substance use or instability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma only with no college enrollment suggests limited opportunities for positive development or access to resources that could aid in turning his life around.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs but without details on stability or profitability may not directly indicate risk but could contribute indirectly through dependency issues or substance use as a coping mechanism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used drugs and felt low for the past month, which is a direct indicator of potential drug dependence and its impact on behavior that can lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Past Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Experienced living with seven people at a young age may contribute to stress or instability that could influence current risky behaviors but without specific evidence of substance use it's not directly indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believes in God, which while providing moral guidance does not directly indicate criminal behavior unless there is consistent support for positive actions which isn't indicated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 215 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
