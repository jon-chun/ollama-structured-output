    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20, which is quite young. Young adults often have more flexibility and may not be as committed to long-term goals, increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe has a White identity. While race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, at this point, it's probably a moderate factor because we don't have enough information on how his background affects his current situation.\n\nHe's been arrested 6 times and convicted\u2014multiple convictions are a strong indicator of past problematic behavior, which likely increases the risk.\n\nHis height is 5'6\" and weight 145 lbs. Weight can be a factor in recidivism, but without knowing if it's overweight or how it affects his daily life, I'm leaning towards low here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with higher risk unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or lack of support, which aren't mentioned.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a key factor\u2014lack of education can lead to more impulsive decisions and lower stability, so this would be high.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can indicate instability, which might correlate with higher risk if it's due to personal issues or substance use.\n\nDrug use history: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and now he feels very down every month. Drug use is a clear indicator of unstable mental health, which can lead to impulsive behavior\u2014high risk here.\n\nHe felt so down that nothing could cheer him up recently, suggesting persistent low mood or depression. This is a strong sign of mental instability, increasing the risk further\u2014high.\n\nPast living conditions: at young age, lived with non-biological parents in an urban area household size 5. Growing up in such circumstances can lead to social and emotional issues, potentially affecting his ability to function maturely now\u2014a high factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. While this reflects on his spirituality rather than substance use or mental health, it's a moderate consideration as it might influence his behavior indirectly.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple factors point towards a high risk of rearrest due to multiple arrests, drug use, instability, and underlying mental health issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young adults often have more flexibility and may not be as committed to long-term goals, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"moderate\", \"While race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, at this point, it's probably a moderate factor because we don't have enough information on how his background affects his current situation.\"),\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple prior arrests and convictions are strong indicators of past problematic behavior, which likely increases the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't directly correlate with higher risk unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or lack of support, which aren't mentioned.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not being enrolled in college can lead to more impulsive decisions and lower stability, significantly increasing the risk.\"),\n    (\"Job Stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding 3 jobs may indicate some instability, but without evidence of substance use or other issues, this factor is moderate rather than high.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Persistent drug use, especially with feelings of low mood or depression, significantly increases the risk of reoffending due to unstable mental health and impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"high\", \"Feeling down every month suggests persistent low mood or depression, which can lead to impulsive actions and higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"high\", \"Growing up in an urban area with non-biological parents in a household of 5 may have led to social and emotional issues, affecting current behavior and stability.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"moderate\", \"Believing in God doesn't directly correlate with higher risk but might influence behavior indirectly.
