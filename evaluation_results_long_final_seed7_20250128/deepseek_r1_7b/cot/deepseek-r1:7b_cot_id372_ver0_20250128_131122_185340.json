    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old female. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a history of three arrests and two convictions. That seems significant because more convictions usually correlate with higher risk. Each prior offense can increase the chances of reoffending, so that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct indicator in risk assessment unless it's related to substance use or health issues. She hasn't used drugs for four years but felt down recently. That could be related to her mental health, maybe depression, which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support networks; maybe she feels more isolated, which might lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor\u2014those without education often have fewer job opportunities and may engage in riskier activities.\n\nShe held only one job last year. Employment stability can influence recidivism because having a steady job reduces the need for illegal activities to support oneself.\n\nDrug use history is present, but she stopped using four years ago. However, recent feelings of low mood might be due to other issues rather than drug use, which complicates things.\n\nYoung age and living with her biological dad in a household of four could mean she's been influenced by an environment that may not support healthy coping mechanisms or positive role models.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God. This could affect her mental health; maybe she turns to other substances as a coping mechanism, which might lead to substance abuse issues contributing to recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior convictions (high), recent drug use history but stopped, current mood is unclear if linked to drugs or another issue (moderate), living alone and single may contribute to isolation (medium), low education (low), stable job (moderate), young age and family environment (low).\n\nConsidering everything, the risk factors are mixed. The multiple convictions and lack of education are strong indicators but might be offset by her recent drug use stopping and stable job. However, her prior convictions make me lean towards a medium to high risk.\n\nI think the prediction is \"YES\" with a confidence level around 65%. She has some mitigating factors like the job and drug use history, but the prior convictions are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Three prior arrests and two convictions significantly increase the risk of recidivism as each offense can lead to deeper involvement in criminal activities or supervision.\",\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"While she has a history of drug use, it stopped four years ago.

She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
