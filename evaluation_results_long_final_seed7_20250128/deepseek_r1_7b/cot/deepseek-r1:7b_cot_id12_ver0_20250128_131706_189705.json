    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which is a factor. His demographics are white (the defendant), but he's Black, so maybe that doesn't directly apply here.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism. No marital status or living situation to consider either; he's alone, which might be associated with lower risk sometimes.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma and is in college, which could mean better opportunities and possibly less incentive to commit crimes for better things.\n\nHe's worked three jobs, so maybe stable income. Drug use: he used marijuana before but recently felt down. That could indicate some triggers or stressors that might lead him to use again, though it's not a direct risk factor unless it's linked to criminal behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five suggests he has a supportive family background. Maybe that contributes to lower recidivism risk because of the support system and positive influences.\n\nHis belief in God could provide emotional support but might also be seen as a lack of alternative coping mechanisms if he faces setbacks, though that's more about personal resilience than direct risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, his favorable factors seem to lean towards low or medium risk. No clear high-risk indicators like extensive criminal history (he only has one arrest), no severe substance abuse beyond marijuana use, and supportive family background.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one prior arrest but it is not a conviction.

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
