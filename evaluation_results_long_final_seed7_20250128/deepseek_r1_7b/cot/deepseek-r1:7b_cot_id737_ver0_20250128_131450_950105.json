    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 19-year-old male. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals might have different risk profiles compared to adults. But he hasn't been convicted yet; just arrested nine times. I remember that multiple arrests can be a red flag but not as strong as prior convictions since he's still developing his criminal history.\n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches, which is quite tall, but I don't think height affects recidivism risk significantly unless there's something about it, but in this case, no relevant info. Next, he's never married and living alone. Being single doesn't directly correlate with higher or lower risk, but maybe living alone could indicate past instability, though he has no prior criminal history.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Maybe not the best educational background, which can sometimes lead to unemployment issues later on. He's had no jobs during the year, so that's concerning for employment stability, which is often linked to lower recidivism. Plus, he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, but some down mood recently\u2014he might be struggling mentally.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. That's a large family, and living with multiple siblings could contribute to instability or neglect issues, which might have long-term effects on his behavior and reintegration after release.\n\nHe believes in God, so religious factors aren't directly impacting recidivism here unless there are underlying issues like lack of faith or substance abuse, but no info on that. \n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (though not convictions), living alone (could be isolation), no job experience, and a large family background might suggest a higher risk. However, his age is still relatively young, which could mitigate some factors.\n\nI think the high school diploma without college enrollment could mean he's more likely to have low educational aspirations or maybe just finished high school, but not sure how that affects recidivism beyond prior issues.\n\nOverall, considering all these points, I'm leaning towards a medium risk. The multiple arrests and living situation are concerning, but his age might temper the risk compared to someone older with similar factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having nine arrests without prior convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to reoffending.
