    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old Black female. She's been arrested twice but not convicted, which is a minor offense history. Her age being young might mean she's still developing her life skills.\n\nShe weighs 152 lbs and is 5'4\", which doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of physical factors. Living alone suggests she's independent, so maybe less risk from living arrangements affecting her behavior.\n\nHer marital status is single, no kids mentioned, so no family dynamics to consider here. She has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which might mean she's looking for further education or career opportunities\u2014could indicate positive intentions.\n\nShe's worked three jobs in the past year; having some steady employment history could suggest stability and lower recidivism risk compared to someone with a longer inactive period. However, job instability can still be a risk factor if there were issues during those jobs.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to using marijuana in the past four years but hasn't in recent months. The recent lack of drug use is positive. However, past use could indicate ongoing substance abuse which might affect her mental health and stability.\n\nHer young age at which she lived with her biological mother in a household of six in an urban area suggests possible exposure to family dynamics that might impact her behavior or mental health as an adult. Urban environments can sometimes have higher stress levels or different social contexts, but without more info on the family environment, it's hard to quantify.\n\nHer belief in God could be seen as a positive factor for personal morality and stability, though individual interpretations vary widely.\n\nConsidering all these factors: minor offense history, independent living, education progress, employment history, recent drug use change, and family background. I think her risk is probably low, but not nonexistent. Maybe around 30% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"offense_history\", \"low\", \"Her minor offense history of two arrests but no conviction suggests she has not been convicted for any serious offenses which might indicate lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Being 22 years old may suggest she is still developing life skills and may have a lower risk compared to older individuals who may face more significant challenges.\"),\n    (\"independent_living\", \"low\", \"Living alone suggests independence, which can be protective as it often correlates with positive life choices and stability.\"),\n    (\"education_progress\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college might indicate some focus on education or career advancement, which could be a medium risk factor depending on future endeavors.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Holding three jobs during the year indicates a stable income source and active participation in the workforce, which can contribute to lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years but not recently may indicate reduced recent substance abuse, though past use could still be a risk factor depending on ongoing habits.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of six in an urban area at a young age might suggest exposure to family dynamics that could impact adult behavior or mental health, but without more information, it's hard to quantify this risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
