    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals might have more potential for reoffending as they develop skills and relationships. So that's a medium risk because while he's young, the factors contributing to recidivism are still present.\n\nHe has no prior convictions but one arrest. A single misdemeanor can increase the risk compared to a felony, so that's high risk. The misdemeanor adds another point of vulnerability.\n\nHis lack of education\u2014no HS diploma or GED and not in college\u2014points toward lower self-esteem and higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. That's definitely medium to high.\n\nLiving alone without a support network can isolate him, making it harder for him to get help if he starts down that path. That's another medium risk factor.\n\nHe's employed but hasn't used drugs or feel depressed recently. No substance use is better than using, so maybe low here because he's not currently at risk of drug-related issues.\n\nNo family support from his mother in a household of three adds to isolation and lack of guidance, which is high risk as it can hinder his ability to find positive role models.\n\nHis lack of religious affiliation might mean fewer community resources or social networks available to him if he needs help. That's medium because it affects access but isn't as directly tied to recidivism as other factors like family support.\n\nPutting it all together, he has a high risk profile with multiple contributing factors. Even though some are mitigating (like no drug use), the overall risk is significant enough that I'd predict YES for 3-year rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which may indicate a higher potential for reoffending as they develop skills and relationships.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"One misdemeanor arrest without a conviction indicates vulnerability to similar offenses in the future.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED reflects lower educational attainment, which can correlate with increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce community support and social networks that could aid in positive decision-making.\"), \n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Currently employed without recent substance use or depression suggests a stable environment and reduced immediate risk of problematic behavior.\"),\n    (\"Family Support\", \"high\", \"Exposure to a family environment without guidance from a biological mother may limit access to positive role models or support systems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
