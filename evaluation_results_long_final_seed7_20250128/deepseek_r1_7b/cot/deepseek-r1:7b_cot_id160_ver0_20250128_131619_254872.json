    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to historical and systemic factors, but since he has only one arrest without a conviction, it might not be as significant here unless there are other factors tied to his background.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs 160 lbs. Weight isn't typically a direct risk factor in recidivism, so I'll assign low weight here.\n\nNever married and living alone: Living situation can impact substance use and stability, but since he's not married yet, maybe it doesn't add much risk unless he's involved with others or has support networks.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so this would be a low weight factor.\n\nTwo job experiences in the past year: Employment usually helps with financial stability and reducing stress, so probably low weight.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana use isn't as severe as other drugs like cocaine or heroin, so maybe medium risk because occasional drug use can lead to other issues, though he's not experiencing negative feelings now.\n\nPast home environment: He lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area of a household size 4. This might suggest a stable early environment, but living in an urban setting could expose him to more stressors or crime, so medium risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: He doesn't believe in God and considers it unrelated to his personal events. This might indicate some existential anxiety, which can affect mental health indirectly, maybe low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: The most significant factors are the past drug use (medium) and living situation with parents (medium). Education and employment are protective but not directly contributing to risk. No high-risk factors like prior convictions or substance abuse leading to severe issues. So overall, I'd predict a low risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"His age is 20 years old, which is within the typical age range for first-time offenses and may indicate lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being White might have some historical context regarding recidivism rates, but this individual has only one arrest without a conviction, so it's not a significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"He is 5'8\" and weighs 160 lbs.
