Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with 7 arrests and 3 convictions. That's a significant past behavior indicating instability, which is high risk.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly related but could hint at potential issues like substance abuse, so I'll consider that as medium risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone; this can contribute to isolation, which might be a medium factor.\n\nHigh school diploma with no college enrollment suggests limited opportunities or perhaps unstable personal circumstances\u2014another medium risk point.\n\nHaving held 3 jobs in the past year shows some work experience, but inconsistent employment could indicate other challenges, so medium risk again.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Substance abuse often leads to recidivism, making this a high factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which might be positive, but it's not directly related to substance use or criminal history\u2014so medium here.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in a rural area could have provided emotional support, possibly mitigating some risk factors\u2014low impact overall.\n\nConsidering God's influence on his life is personal and may relate to personal values, which might help but isn't directly tied to recidivism\u2014another low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: most factors are high or medium except the living situation and lack of depression. The high number of arrests and drug use push him towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with 7 arrests and 3 convictions, indicating past instability and higher likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning and strongly correlates with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in the past year suggests some work experience, but inconsistent employment could indicate underlying issues affecting stability.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a partner may contribute to isolation or potential emotional challenges that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"biological_parental\u751f\u6d3b\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents at a young age in a rural area provides emotional support, mitigating some risk factors.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month is positive but not directly related to recidivism unless it masks other issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
