    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 21-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two prior arrests and one conviction. That's a significant red flag because having a record increases the likelihood of reoffending. So that should be high risk.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 155 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor in recidivism unless there's something about his health, but since he's not depressed recently, maybe it's not an issue here. Probably low to medium risk based on other factors.\n\nNot married and living with someone else who isn't him suggests he might have some support, which could be good for reducing risk. That should be a lower weight factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not completing higher education can sometimes correlate with more criminal behavior or substance use issues. So this is medium to low risk.\n\nOnly held one job recently. Joblessness can lead to unstable living situations and increased chances of engaging in risky behaviors, so that's medium to low.\n\nDrug use from the past four years, specifically marijuana. Substance abuse often correlates with recidivism because it can lead to more impulsive behavior or financial issues. That should be high risk.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed last month, which is a positive sign as substance abuse often leads to mental health issues that can escalate into more serious offenses. So the lack of depression might temper the drug use's impact.\n\nYoung age at 21 with prior convictions suggests he may not have much life experience, potentially making him more susceptible to similar offenses later. That points towards high risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of five from a young age could mean he was raised in an environment that might lack supervision or support, which can increase the risk of recidivism. High risk here.\n\nReligious belief in God affecting his personal decisions is a bit tricky but doesn't directly contribute to criminal behavior unless there's evidence of sinewiness, which isn't provided. So maybe medium to low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are the strongest indicator pointing towards high risk. Drug use and lack of supervision also contribute significantly. The other factors don't outweigh these negatives, so overall, I'd predict a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has two prior arrests and one conviction, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Demographic Factors - Age and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five from a young age may indicate less supervision, increasing risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Job History and Education Level\", \"low\", \"Only held one job recently; not enrolled in college.
