    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a query where the user wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 20-year-old male and want me to assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor before predicting his 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, I need to break down each of the factors they've listed. Let's go through them one by one.\n\nThe person is White, which might be a red flag due to racial disparities in the criminal justice system, but since he hasn't been convicted yet and has only two arrests, maybe it doesn't heavily contribute here.\n\nHe\u2019s 6 feet tall and over 250 lbs. Obesity can sometimes correlate with higher risk of certain offenses or supervision issues, so that's a medium factor.\n\nNot being married and living alone \u2013 living arrangements can affect social support, which might mitigate some risk factors but could also expose him to more stressors depending on the situation.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college \u2013 educational level is typically a protective factor, especially with stable employment opportunities. So this would be low risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year \u2013 previous work experience is positive for recidivism, so that's another low factor.\n\nDrug use history (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years\u2014drug use can lead to substance abuse issues which might affect his behavior or employability. That\u2019s a medium risk factor because it's recent but still present.\n\nNot feeling depressed in the past month \u2013 lack of mental health support could mean he's relying on other factors, so this is low risk since he seems mentally stable.\n\nYounger age at first arrest and living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Living with family can provide stability and support, which usually lowers recidivism rates. So that\u2019s a protective factor, making it low.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with personal events \u2013 this indicates he has some level of religious support or belief system, which is generally protective as it provides guidance and reduces self-harm risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the drug use (medium) seems like the highest risk. However, since he's only 20, maybe his recidivism rate isn't too high yet. But considering he has two prior arrests without a conviction, which might have negative implications for future opportunities or supervision. The urban living with family is protective but not enough to offset the drug use and possible behavioral issues.\n\nSo I'd lean towards low risk because of the protective factors like education, previous stable housing, and family support. But considering the drug use (medium) and past arrests, maybe it's slightly higher than just low. However, overall, given all factors, his risk is probably low to medium. But since some factors are pushing it a bit towards medium, I think the collective prediction might be on the lower side of medium or perhaps edge into low.\n\nWait, but considering he has two prior arrests without convictions, that could limit his opportunities and increase supervision time, which might make him more likely to rearrest if he's not actively employed or involved in positive activities. So maybe it's better to classify this as a medium risk because the past behavior is still present, even though he hasn't been convicted.\n\nTherefore, I'll assign each factor accordingly: Medium for drug use and Medium for prior arrests, with other factors being low. The overall prediction would be NO rearrest in three years, but my confidence is around 75% since while there are mitigating factors, the presence of drug use and past behavior adds to the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"White\", \"low\", \"Racial background can influence recidivism rates due to systemic inequalities in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"6 feet 0 inches, over 250 lbs\", \"Medium\", \"Obesity is sometimes associated with higher risk of certain offenses or supervision issues.\"),\n    (\"Not married and currently not living alone\", \"low\", \"Living arrangements can affect social support, which may mitigate some risk factors but could also expose the individual to stressors depending on their situation.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma, not enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Educational level is typically a protective factor, especially with stable employment opportunities available to those with a high school diploma.\"),\n    (\"Held 2 jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Previous work experience is generally a positive indicator of employability and stability, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"medium\", \"Substance abuse history can lead to behavioral issues or increased likelihood of self-harm, which may affect recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Not felt depressed over the past month\", \"low\", \"Lack of mental health support indicates stability, which can reduce recidivism risk if other factors are controlled.\"),\n    (\"Younger age at first arrest and currently living with biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area\", \"low\", \"Living with family provides stability and guidance, which typically lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally\", \"low\", \"Religious belief can provide guidance and reduce self-harm risk, making it a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
