    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearrest within three years. He's white, 6'11\", weighs between 200-224 lbs, living alone, not married, enrolled in school, has one job, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years, felt really down recently, had a tough early life with his mother in a household of four, and doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, age. He's 19, which is pretty young, so maybe he's still developing socially and might have some behavioral issues that could lead to more problems later.\n\nRace. Being white might be a factor because there are systemic issues with the criminal justice system that affect certain communities, but since this is an individual case, it's probably less direct unless there's a history of violence or bias incidents.\n\nWeight: 6'11\" and between 200-224 lbs. That's quite heavy for his height, so maybe he has underlying health issues or metabolic risks which could contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\n\nLiving situation alone. He's living on his own without a support network, which can be risky as he might struggle with mental health or substance use without someone to help.\n\nNo prior convictions but one arrest. Having an arrest without a conviction is still a risk because it shows potential trouble and could lead to more issues if not addressed properly.\n\nMarital status: single living alone adds to the isolation stress, which can exacerbate mental health issues or substance use problems.\n\nEmployment: He's got a job, which is positive as having income can help with stability. But only one job might mean limited support system, especially during tough times.\n\nDrug use in the past four years and recent intense feelings of depression. Drug use can have long-term consequences and mental health issues like depression can increase the risk of other crimes or reoffs if not managed.\n\nEarly life circumstances: growing up with his mother in a household of four in an urban area suggests he might face family dysfunction, lack of stability, which are known contributors to recidivism. Also, not believing in God might mean he's dealing with personal spirituality issues without support, possibly leading him into risky behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together, each factor seems significant. The weight could be a health risk that contributes indirectly. Drug use and recent depression are direct risk factors linked to relapse. Early life circumstances put him at a higher risk for various stressors and substance abuse. The lack of a support system from living alone adds to potential mental health issues.\n\nConsidering all these, the risk is pretty high. I would assign each factor accordingly but lean towards a high confidence prediction that he'll be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"High\", \"The individual's age of 19 indicates potential developmental challenges and increased vulnerability to behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"Low\", \"While race can influence systemic risk factors, this case is evaluated on individual circumstances without prior evidence of racial discrimination in criminal justice affecting this specific individual.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"Medium\", \"His height and weight may indicate underlying health risks that could contribute to recidivism if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"High\", \"Living alone increases isolation risk, which can exacerbate mental health issues or substance use problems.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"Medium\", \"One prior arrest without a conviction shows potential trouble, but the absence of a conviction is noted.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"Low to Medium\", \"Single living alone introduces isolation stress, though it does not immediately indicate a high risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"Low\", \"Having one job provides some stability, which might help reduce recidivism risk compared to those without any employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use and Depression\", \"High\", \"Past four years of drug use and recent severe depression are direct contributors to increased risk of relapse or reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Early Life Circumstances\", \"High\", \"Growing up in a household of four with limited family support in an urban area indicates potential for family dysfunction and increased stressors that may lead to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"Medium\", \"Not believing in God might mean he's dealing with spirituality issues without support, which could contribute indirectly but is not directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
