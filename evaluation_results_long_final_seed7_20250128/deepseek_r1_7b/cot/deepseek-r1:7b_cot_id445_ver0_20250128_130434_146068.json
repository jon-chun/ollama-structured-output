    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's 18 years old, which is relatively young, but since he hasn't been convicted yet, maybe his age isn't a big factor here unless there are other indicators of higher risk associated with age.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure how race plays into recidivism risk assessment in this context, so maybe it's neutral or part of the judicial system's considerations.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. So this is an incomplete record; maybe it doesn't show past behavior leading to serious issues if he had been convicted.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'6\" and 130 lbs. Not sure how that factors in unless there are specific health concerns, which I don't see here.\n\nLiving alone with no spouse or partner is a factor, but since he's not married yet, it might be less of an issue compared to someone who's been married for a long time.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school. Education can be a mitigating factor; having ongoing education suggests he's committed and trying to improve his situation.\n\nHe held two jobs in the past year. Employment history is positive as it shows responsibility and ability to support himself, which lowers recidivism risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug abuse can be a strong indicator of potential relapse or ongoing issues, so that's concerning.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of six in a rural area. That might suggest living conditions that could contribute to substance abuse or other behavioral issues. Also, growing up in a large household without parents nearby (since he considers God unrelated) might have social and emotional challenges.\n\nHis belief in God not affecting his personal life could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which some studies suggest can influence behavior and substance use.\n\nPutting this together: The arrest is incomplete, but the drug use seems significant. Living with many family members without parents nearby and considering God irrelevant might contribute to behavioral issues. While he's in school and has job experience, those are mitigating factors.\n\nThe high risk comes mainly from past drug use (high), living situation (high), and belief in no spiritual support (high). The arrest is low or medium since it's incomplete. Employment and education are positive but not as strong as the negative factors.\n\nSo overall, his risk of rearrest within three years might be high due to the drug use, living conditions, and lack of support system.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"He has one arrest but no conviction, which may not directly correlate to future recidivism without further evidence of prior issues leading to legal consequences.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use can significantly increase the risk of relapse or continued substance abuse, contributing to rearrest potential.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"high\", \"Living with a household of six in a rural area without access to parents may have posed challenges that could contribute to behavioral issues or increased risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Not considering God as a factor in personal life might affect his emotional support and decision-making, potentially influencing substance use and behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Currently employed with two job experiences can suggest responsibility and financial stability but may not directly offset other significant risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
