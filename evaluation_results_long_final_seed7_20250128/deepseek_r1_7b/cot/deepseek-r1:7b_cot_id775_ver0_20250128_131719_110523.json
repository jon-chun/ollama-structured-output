    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. Does race play a role in recidivism? I think there are some disparities, but with only one offense and not much else about his background, it might be low significance here.\n\nNext, he has a criminal history\u20141 arrest and 1 conviction. That's a red flag; more past convictions usually mean higher risk.\n\nHe's 5'4\" and weighs 160 lbs. Weight alone doesn't indicate much without knowing his BMI or other factors. Maybe not a significant factor here.\n\nLiving alone at 18 is common, especially for first-time offenders. No information on living conditions affecting him, so probably low impact.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED; he's not in college either. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism because it can lead to better job opportunities and support systems. His lack of education might increase his risk.\n\nHe held only 1 job during the year. Employment stability is important for reducing recidivism, so having just one job could be a risk factor.\n\nDrug use: he used cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse can have multiple effects\u2014impairment leading to more crimes or maybe legal issues again. However, not feeling depressed might mitigate some negative impacts.\n\nYounger age at first offense (18) suggests he's still developing and may be impulsive or lacks life skills. Younger offenders often have lower recidivism rates because they're more likely to grow out of it, but it's also a risk factor since they might not have the same life experiences yet.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of 3 in a rural area at a young age\u2014rural environments can offer limited support and social networks. However, being raised by his mother doesn't directly correlate to lower or higher recidivism; it's more about the environment's resources rather than the relationship itself.\n\nNo involvement with God affecting him personally might mean he has less religious support for making good choices, which could increase impulsive decisions leading to crime.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple factors like past criminal history, limited education, and being 18 years old point towards a high risk. The drug use is moderate but not severe; no depression in recent months might reduce some negative impact. However, race isn't significant here. So overall, his risk seems quite high.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully analyzing each factor related to the individual's background and circumstances, it appears that multiple risk factors contribute significantly to his likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n\n1. **Criminal History:** 1 previous arrest and conviction is a significant indicator of past behavior that may influence future actions.\n2. **Education Level:** Lack of high school diploma or GED and not currently enrolled in college can affect job opportunities and support systems, increasing risk.\n3. **Employment:** Holding only one job during the year might limit his ability to establish stable financial and social supports needed for reintegration.\n\n**Moderate Risk Factors:**\n\n1. **Drug Use:** Occasional cocaine use may have short-term negative impacts but does not necessarily correlate with increased recidivism if there is no recent severe drug-related issues.\n2. **Youth Age at Offense:** Being 18 years old when committing the offense could indicate a younger age of onset, which might be associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\n**Low Risk Factors:**\n\n1. **Living Alone:** Living alone does not inherently increase risk unless there are underlying issues such as instability or lack of support networks.\n2. **No Religious Involved:** Limited involvement with God may affect personal choices and moral decision-making, but this is context-dependent and not directly correlated with recidivism.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe combination of a criminal history, limited education, and employment status creates significant risk factors that suggest a high likelihood of rearrest within three years. While some factors like occasional drug use and youth age are present, they do not outweigh the stronger indicators of increased risk.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"high\", \"Multiple past criminal records increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior and rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Limited educational attainment can hinder job opportunities and social support, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
