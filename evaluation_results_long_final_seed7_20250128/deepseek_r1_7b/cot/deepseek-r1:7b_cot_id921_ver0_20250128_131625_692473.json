    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest but no conviction. That's not much on the risk side since it's just an arrest, so low risk there.\n\nHis weight is on the higher end, 5'9\" and between 200-224 lbs. I don't see any direct link to weight in recidivism, so maybe medium risk because he's heavier but not necessarily indicating anything else.\n\nHe's living alone, which isn't a strong indicator either way. Medium risk here since it doesn't guarantee stability or lack thereof.\n\nHis education level is present tense\u2014he\u2019s enrolled now. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism if he's in school actively trying to better himself. So maybe low to medium based on his circumstances.\n\nNo job history; that could be a red flag because employment can help him stay out of trouble and support himself. Since he has none, perhaps higher risk?\n\nHe\u2019s never used drugs for the past four years\u2014good sign. Substance abuse is a major factor in recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t felt depressed in the past month. Positive mental state usually correlates with lower risk, so low to medium.\n\nBiologically, he lived with his mother at age 18 in an urban area with three people. Urban areas might have different dynamics, but since it's a positive environment and no issues yet, maybe medium risk here.\n\nHis belief that God doesn't affect him\u2014could be related to motivation or lack thereof. If he doesn\u2019t see a higher power as influencing his decisions, perhaps slightly higher risk? Not sure, so maybe low to medium.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest (low), weight is neutral (medium?), living alone (medium), no job (possibly high), no drugs (low), no depression (low). The factors that stand out are the lack of a job and not feeling depressed. The arrest isn't too bad, but his motivation might be low if he doesn't feel supported by religion.\n\nI'm leaning towards medium risk because while some factors like living alone could contribute to instability, the main negatives are minimal\u2014no job, no drug use, etc. But since he has an arrest, that's a point pushing it slightly higher.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"1.
