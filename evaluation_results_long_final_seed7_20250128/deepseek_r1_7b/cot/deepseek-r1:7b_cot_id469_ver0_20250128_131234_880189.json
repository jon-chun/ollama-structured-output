    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of this 19-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which might indicate he's still developing, but it's also a time when people often change their behaviors or career paths. Since he has only one arrest and no conviction, that suggests he hasn't faced significant legal consequences yet, so maybe lower risk from that standpoint.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly relevant to recidivism, so I can note them as low relevance factors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Being single in the same area could mean less social support or potentially more isolation, which might contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors. That feels like a medium risk factor.\n\nHis educational background is high school diploma but not college enrollment. Dropping out early can sometimes lead to unstable life choices or increased substance abuse, so that's another medium risk.\n\nHe has three job experiences during the year. Having some work experience might indicate he's more self-sufficient, which could lower recidivism risk compared to someone without any prior work history. That would be low risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014he used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. The recent lack of depression might suggest he's not struggling with severe mental health issues tied to drug use, so maybe a low risk for this factor.\n\nHis background: at a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of five in a rural area. That environment could contribute to family dysfunction or other social issues that might increase risk, but it also provides some stability since he was raised by his biological parents. So medium risk here.\n\nConsidering his religious belief\u2014God has something to do with his life\u2014he might have strong moral guidance, which could aid in avoiding risky behaviors. That's a low to medium factor depending on how consistently he follows that guidance.\n\nPutting all these together: medium factors like living situation and family background, some low factors from education and job history, but also some medium influences. Without more data, the overall risk isn't extremely high, so I might predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which may indicate a period of development and potential for change in behavior or circumstances.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"He has used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently, suggesting he isn't struggling with severe mental health issues tied to drug use.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \" living alone at a young age in a household of size 5 could indicate family dysfunction or other social issues that might increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Educational Background\", \"low\", \"He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which may suggest he is self-sufficient or may face challenges related to education gaps.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held 3 jobs during the year may indicate stability and self-reliance, reducing recidivism risk compared to someone without prior work experience.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing living with both parents in a rural area could contribute to family dysfunction or other social issues that might increase risk but also provides some stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
