    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let's break down all her factors step by step.\n\nFirst off, she has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college. That usually means better job opportunities and maybe a more stable future, which might lower her risk of reoffending compared to someone without an education.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can be a red flag because it can lead to addiction, strained relationships, and other risky behaviors that might make her want to commit another crime. But since she's 21, maybe she's in recovery or just starting out, so this could be low to medium.\n\nShe never felt depressed over the past month. That's interesting. Sometimes substance abuse can lead to depression as a side effect, but if she's not feeling it now, that might indicate she's doing things to stay positive. It might actually lower her risk here.\n\nShe lives alone, which is good for avoiding domestic issues or getting involved in trouble with roommates. She also hasn't been married yet, so no family problems there.\n\nHer past home was a household of five at a young age in a rural area. Growing up in such a big household might have caused stress or neglect, but it's not always directly linked to criminal behavior unless there were family issues or abuse. Since she's now living alone and doing well education-wise, maybe that factor isn't as high.\n\nShe considers God involved in her life\u2014so she's religious. Being religious can sometimes lead to more rule-abiding behavior if she's focused on moral values, but it could also mean she avoids taking risks for fun or excitement, which might not be directly linked to recidivism unless there were previous issues.\n\nShe has two job experiences during the year. Having some work experience is positive because it shows responsibility and maybe a desire to get out of the cycle of crime if she was once involved.\n\nPutting this all together: education seems good, no major drug issues now, living alone, religious involvement, and recent positive affect without depression. The only negative factors are past drug use and her family background when young. But since she's doing well now, I think the positives outweigh the negatives. So maybe there's a low to medium risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High School Diploma and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college, which suggests future stability and reduced likelihood of immediate recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana and Cocaine) in Past Four Years\", \"medium\", \"While she has used drugs, there's no recent evidence of severe depression or ongoing drug use, which could indicate potential recovery efforts affecting her risk level.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce the risk of domestic issues or interactions that could lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"No Depression in Past Month\", \"low\", \"The absence of recent depression suggests she is maintaining a positive outlook and possibly engaging in healthy activities that could deter recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Religious Background and Family History\", \"low\", \"Her religious involvement may indicate strong moral values, while her family history during youth, though concerning, does not directly correlate with current criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment History (2 Jobs in Past Year)\", \"low\", \"Having two job experiences suggests responsibility and a desire to avoid further involvement in criminal activities if previously involved.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
