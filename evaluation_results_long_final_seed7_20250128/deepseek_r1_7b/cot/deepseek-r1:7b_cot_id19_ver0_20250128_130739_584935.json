    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old male rearrest. He's white, has a history of four arrests and convictions, which is a strong indicator of past issues. His age being 20 might mean he's still developing, but since he's got multiple offenses, that's worrying.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs 135 lbs. I don't think his physical stats directly affect recidivism unless there's something about his weight influencing his behavior, which seems unlikely here.\n\nLiving alone is a factor because living with someone can provide support and reduce stressors. But since he's living alone now, maybe that's an indicator of instability or higher risk elsewhere in his life.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Maybe not going back to school could mean less supervision or opportunities for positive change.\n\nHe's held five jobs in a year. That might show some flexibility, but if he's switching between jobs without much stability, that could be problematic. Maybe inconsistent income is causing stress.\n\nDrug use history of marijuana and cocaine over four years with recent heavy use is concerning. Substance abuse often correlates with recidivism due to impulsive behavior or unstable situations.\n\nHe felt so down for the past month that nothing could cheer him up. That's a strong indicator of low self-esteem, which can lead to risky behaviors or substance abuse.\n\nHis early life was in an urban area with his four biological parents, but he considers God not involved in his life. That might suggest some form of spirituality or lack thereof affecting his behavior\u2014though I'm not sure how that ties into recidivism directly.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, drug use, living alone, inconsistent work, low self-esteem\u2014all point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Four previous arrests and convictions are significant indicators of past behavior issues that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_andDevelopmental_Stage\", \"low\", \"Age is 20, which may indicate a period of potential growth but does not directly correlate with increased risk without considering prior offenses.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could increase stress or isolation, potentially contributing to behavioral issues that might lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"education_status\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and not attending college may indicate limited opportunities for positive change or supervision which can be risk factors.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"high\", \"Held five jobs in a year could suggest inconsistent income, which might contribute to unstable living conditions or financial stress that could lead to substance abuse or risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a clear indicator of potential ongoing substance abuse issues, which are strong risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"recent_mood_state\", \"high\", \"Felt so down in the dumps recently that nothing could cheer him up indicates low self-esteem or recent trauma, both of which can lead to risky decisions and substance use, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
