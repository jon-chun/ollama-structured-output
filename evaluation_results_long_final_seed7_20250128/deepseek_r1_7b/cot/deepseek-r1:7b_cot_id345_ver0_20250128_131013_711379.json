Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White, but race isn't a direct indicator of recidivism in most studies unless there are systemic issues, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe low weight.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. One prior offense is concerning, so that might be medium to high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism. Low.\n\nUnmarried and living alone\u2014single individuals can sometimes have different support networks, but not necessarily higher risk. Maybe medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college\u2014lower education usually correlates with higher risk because of limited opportunities for better jobs or stabilization. So probably medium-high.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year\u2014that suggests some work experience, which might indicate he's more stable. Maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to instability, but since he doesn't feel depressed now, maybe lower risk. Medium.\n\nHe lived with both parents at a young age in a rural area of size 4. That's a small household and rural areas often have higher crime rates or poorer environments, which could contribute to higher risk. Maybe high.\n\nBelieving in God\u2014religion can influence behavior, but unless there's evidence of sin or neglect, it might not directly impact risk as much. So low.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (medium), education (medium-high), living situation (high). The rest seem lower except for maybe the prior offense and living with parents which is high. The jobs held are four, so that's medium. Drug use in past but no recent depression\u2014maybe medium. Since he's White, perhaps a slight consideration, but not enough to tip it over.\n\nSo overall prediction: High risk of rearrest because of the prior conviction, living situation, and maybe not enough mitigating factors like strong support from religion or education if that were more impactful.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here is the structured response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White is a protected category but in most studies its impact isn't significant unless systemic issues are present.
