Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of four arrests and four convictions. That's pretty significant. Recidivistic tendencies are high among those with multiple convictions, so that's a strong red flag.\n\nHe's got a GED but isn't in college. Not going to school might mean he doesn't have the same opportunities or support system as someone with an actual degree, which could contribute to him getting back into trouble.\n\nLiving alone adds another layer of risk. Being in a stable environment is important for personal growth and avoiding triggers like family issues or substance use while living with others.\n\nHe uses marijuana occasionally but mostly felt down recently. Drug use can have mental health consequences, affecting his ability to function and make responsible decisions.\n\nA young age at which he lived with his biological mother suggests he might not have much support network. Younger individuals sometimes lack the life skills and stability that older people bring, making him more susceptible to negative influences.\n\nConsidering his religious beliefs could influence his behavior in positive ways but also might provide cover for problematic actions if he faces challenges.\n\nPutting it all together, multiple factors point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested 4 times and convicted, indicating a history of criminal behavior which increases the likelihood of future arrests.\"),\n    (\"ged_status\", \"low\", \"He holds a GED but is not enrolled in college; lack of educational opportunities may reduce his ability to secure employment or improve life circumstances.\"),\n    (\"housing_stability\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a support network, despite being young and having been raised by biological parents, may increase instability which could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \" occasional marijuana use does not necessarily indicate heavy substance abuse but frequent drug use can have negative mental health effects that may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"biographical_context\", \"high\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of three from a young age and considering religion as something influencing his behavior adds complexity, potentially indicating both protective and risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
