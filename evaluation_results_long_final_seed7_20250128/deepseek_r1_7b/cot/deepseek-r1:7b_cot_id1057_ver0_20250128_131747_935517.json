    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of a 20-year-old Black male with rearrest recidivism over three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history \u2013 one arrest and one conviction. That's a solid red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of future offenses.\n\nHis age is 20, which might make him more likely to transition from adolescence to adulthood but doesn't necessarily guarantee recidivism on its own. However, since he already has a conviction, that should weigh heavily.\n\nHe's 6'0\" and weighs 187 lbs. While weight can be associated with higher risk in some contexts due to body fat or health issues, this info alone isn't enough without knowing his health status. So maybe low impact here.\n\nNot being married and living alone could indicate independence, which might lower risk compared to living with someone else who could offer support. But it's not a huge indicator on its own.\n\nEducation-wise, he lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is a big factor because without it, he might have less opportunities for positive development, increasing his risk.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Job experience can be positive if stable but negative if volatile. With just one job, maybe that's not a strong indicator yet.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor because it can impair judgment, relationships, and self-control.\n\nHe lived at a young age with his biological mother in a large household of seven in an urban area. Being raised in such a setting could have emotional challenges, possibly leading to behavioral issues or substance use problems.\n\nHis belief that God doesn't affect his life might suggest a lack of religious support, which can be isolating and potentially contribute to risky behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple factors point towards high risk. The prior conviction, lack of education, recent drug use, living situation, and upbringing all strongly indicate he's likely to have a relapse within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"His past criminal history significantly increases the likelihood of future recidivism as prior convictions are strong predictors of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED, which can limit opportunities for positive development and increase risk factors such as substance use and unstable environments.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Recent and Past\", \"medium-high\", \"The recent use of marijuana and feelings of low mood suggest potential substance abuse issues, which are strong indicators of increased risk for relapse in the short term.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at a young age may reduce immediate family support, but without more information on living arrangements now or surrounding circumstances, it's considered a lower impact factor compared to other factors like education and substance use.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium-high\", \"His belief that God has no effect on his personal life could lead to feelings of isolation, potentially contributing to risky behaviors such as drug use or lack of motivation for positive change.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 187 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
