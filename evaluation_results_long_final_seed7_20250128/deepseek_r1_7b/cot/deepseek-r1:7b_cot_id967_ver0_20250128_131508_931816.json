    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history but it's not a conviction\u2014so maybe that's less severe than someone with a full sentence. But still, any arrest can be a red flag.\n\nHis age is 19; that's relatively young, so maybe he's just starting out and might have more potential for positive change. However, he has drug use history (marijuana and cocaine) which could hinder his ability to reintegrate into society positively.\n\nHe's living alone, which can be isolating but maybe not directly related to recidivism unless there's a risk of further substance abuse or neglect.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college\u2014could indicate some level of education but also perhaps limited life skills. Not being married might affect his social support system.\n\nTwo job experiences; that's better than nothing, but maybe he's looking for more stable employment. Drug use could interfere with work performance.\n\nNo depression in the past month, which is a positive sign, but he has a history of drug use so maybe underlying issues are still present.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four in a rural area. That might have had its pros and cons\u2014perhaps more supervision or less if it was too busy. His belief in God could be a source of support but might also influence his behavior if he's using drugs for other reasons.\n\nPutting all this together, the factors that stand out are the drug use history (high), past criminal arrest (medium), living alone (low), and lack of education (low). The job experience is moderate. No depression is positive but doesn't outweigh negatives.\n\nSo, the risk assessment might lean towards medium because of the arrest and drug use. But considering his age and positive signs like no recent depression, maybe it's not as high as I initially thought.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a non-conviction arrest which can still impact future behavior but may be less severe than a conviction.
