    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has six arrests but no convictions. That might not be too bad on its own, but it does suggest some prior Incivitae to legal issues, which could indicate past behavior problems.\n\nHis height and weight don't really seem relevant here, so I'll just note them as neutral factors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can sometimes correlate with substance use or other personal issues, but without more info, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Maybe not working full-time could contribute to underemployment, which might affect his stability. But again, that depends on what he was doing before.\n\nFour job experiences during the year\u2014he worked four times. That seems like stable employment; not having more jobs could mean he's focused or maybe underemployed elsewhere, but it's a positive sign.\n\nHe used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which can lead to other problems affecting his recidivism risk.\n\nIn the last month, he felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This suggests significant emotional distress, which might be linked to deeper personal or family issues contributing to his criminal behavior.\n\nHe was raised in a household of three with his biological dad in an urban area at a young age. That kind of environment can sometimes lead to dependency issues if not properly supported.\n\nLastly, he believes God has no role in his life, which could indicate a lack of religious support or guidance, potentially leading to more self-directed decisions that might be problematic.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests without convictions, drug use, emotional distress, and a past living environment that might have issues. While there are some mitigating factors like being employed and having no prior convictions, the presence of substance abuse and significant personal distress probably elevates his risk. So, I'd lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Six prior arrests but no convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of legal involvement which may indicate past issues that could influence future behavior.
