    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down. I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old female with various factors contributing to her likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is relatively young but still has some life experience. She hasn't been convicted yet, so she's in a clean record state. Her lack of convictions might be favorable, but being arrested once could indicate prior issues that need addressing.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant here; it's more about her personal circumstances and behavior.\n\nMarital status: She's married to someone, which is good as she has support from her spouse. She's living with her spouse without any issues mentioned, so stability in the home could contribute positively.\n\nEducation level: She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Lack of education can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism rates, especially if it's due to drug use or other personal challenges.\n\nJob situation: She hasn't held any jobs during the year. Being unemployed can increase risk as she might struggle with financial stability and maintain positive habits necessary for reintegration into society.\n\nDrug use history: She has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially recent, might indicate current substance abuse which could affect her ability to reintegrate successfully.\n\nEarly life circumstances: Living at a young age with her biological mother in an urban area of size 4 suggests she had some exposure, possibly to stress or family dynamics that might impact her behavior and decision-making later on.\n\nReligious affiliation: She believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious factors can sometimes influence behavior but also promote values like forgiveness and responsibility, which could mitigate risk if applied positively.\n\nPutting it all together, I have to weigh each factor against the others. The education gap is a red flag, along with her drug use history. She's in a marital relationship without issues, so that's positive. Her young age might offer some flexibility but could also indicate immaturity. Lack of job experience and no convictions are on one side, while her past living situation and religious beliefs are on the other.\n\nI think she has moderate risk factors. The education and employment gaps weigh against her, but her marital status and lack of priorConvictions provide some support. So overall, I might lean towards a medium relative weight for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young but still has life experience that may contribute to positive or negative factors depending on context.\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"medium\", \"She has one arrest but no convictions.
