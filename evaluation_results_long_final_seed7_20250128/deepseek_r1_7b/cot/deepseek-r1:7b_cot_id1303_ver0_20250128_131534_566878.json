    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assign relative weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for an 18-year-old male to predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's Black. From what I know, there are systemic issues in the criminal justice system that can lead to higher incarceration rates and longer prison sentences for Black individuals compared to others. This could increase his risk of reoffending after release.\n\nHe has 2 prior convictions. That's a significant factor because having a history of criminal behavior is strongly linked to recidivism. Each prior conviction adds to the likelihood he might engage in similar behavior again.\n\nHis height and weight are given, but I don't see how they directly relate to recidivism risk without more context like body mass index or past health issues related to his weight.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can affect his stability and support system. Living alone increases the risk of isolation, which might make him more susceptible to stressors that could lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; people with higher education are less likely to get involved in the criminal justice system. Not having a degree might put him at risk of falling into similar situations again, especially if he's turning to drugs as a result of lack of educational or life goals.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs in the past year. Job stability is important because unemployment can lead to substance abuse, lack of support, and other risky behaviors that increase recidivism. Having only three jobs might mean he's somewhat stable, but if he's unemployed, it could be worse.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) suggests he's experimenting with drugs, which is a risk factor for more serious substance abuse and potentially illegal activities.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. If he doesn't experience depression or other mental health issues, it might indicate better mental health management, which could reduce his risk of engaging in risky behaviors related to substance use or mental health.\n\nHis early life involved living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in an unstable environment, especially in an urban setting where there's more stress and social issues, can contribute to higher recidivism risk due to exposure to negative influences.\n\nBelieving that God has something to do with his personal events might indicate he has some level of religious support or guidance, which could help him stay on track. However, this is a subjective factor and might not directly correlate with increased risk unless there are underlying issues related to religion influencing his behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors point towards a high risk. Prior convictions, lack of education, living alone, drug use, and early life circumstances all contribute significantly. The presence of Black as an identifier also adds to systemic risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has 2 prior felony convictions, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and increased likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lacks a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, indicating potential lack of support and motivation for positive change.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to isolation but does not necessarily indicate a high risk without additional factors like substance use or mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"jobs_held\", \"low\", \"Held 3 jobs in the past year, suggesting some level of stability but also indicates potential lack of income support and opportunities for positive engagement.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Has used marijuana in the past four years, which can lead to risky behaviors such as substance abuse affecting mental health and legal outcomes.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month; while this is a protective factor, the absence of recent depression does not negate other risk factors like substance use.\"),\n    (\"early life_environment\", \"high\", \"Experienced living with his biological mother in an urban area, which may have exposed him to environmental stressors that could contribute to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
