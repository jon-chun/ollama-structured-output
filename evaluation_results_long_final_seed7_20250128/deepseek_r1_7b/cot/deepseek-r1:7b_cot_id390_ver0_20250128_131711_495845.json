    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old male rearrest within three years. He's white, has a high school diploma, uses drugs sometimes, was raised in a big household with both parents, and has a history of being around people who are supportive.\n\nFirst, his age is quite young\u201422. Young adults often have more flexibility and might not be as committed to their current path, so maybe that's a lower risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs before, which can affect judgment and increase the chance of trouble. But since it's been four years and he's relapsing now, maybe his substance use is a medium risk because it's ongoing but perhaps he's trying to manage it.\n\nHis living situation alone might mean less support system, so that could be medium or low depending on how much isolation affects him. He's never married, which isn't directly related to recidivism but maybe relates more to his environment.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college, which are positive attributes; education can lead to better opportunities and reduce recidivism. His job history\u2014he\u2019s worked three jobs\u2014could indicate he's stable or trying hard, which might be a good sign.\n\nThe fact that he feels down sometimes could lead to substance abuse again, maybe indicating some mental health issues that could contribute to higher risk if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four with both parents, so perhaps there was a lot of attention or lack thereof. Considering his current feelings towards God might mean he's more independent but perhaps less emotionally supportive, which can be a double-edged sword.\n\nPutting all this together, I think the drugs and recent negative mood could increase risk because they're triggers for further issues. The support system from his parents is positive, so maybe that lowers some factors. But since it's been four years with relapse now, maybe he\u2019s in a situation where he can\u2019t control his use anymore.\n\nThe job history suggests stability, which is good. Education could also mean better opportunities. So maybe the risk isn't too high but not low either because of ongoing drug issues and possible mental health challenges.\n\nSo, I'm leaning towards medium risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Young adults often have more flexibility and may be less committed to their current path, which might lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Ongoing substance use can increase the chance of trouble but might be manageable with support.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could mean less support system, potentially increasing isolation risk.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment suggest positive attributes that may lead to better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Three jobs indicate job stability or efforts to manage challenges, which might reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could lead to further issues like substance abuse if not addressed.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
