    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me break down her information step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's Black. From what I know, there are systemic issues in the criminal justice system that can affect outcomes based on race. Even though she hasn't been convicted yet, being Black might mean she faces some disparities which could increase her risk perception.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. It\u2019s important to note whether this was a misdemeanor or felony because convictions carry more weight. But since it's just an arrest, maybe that factor isn\u2019t as high unless there are other factors pushing the risk up.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll ignore those for now.\n\nShe\u2019s living alone without a spouse. Living situation can influence her access to support, which might affect her ability to seek help or avoid certain triggers. But since she's not married, maybe that's less of an issue.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education level is a big factor in recidivism. Not completing school often correlates with higher chances of reoffending because there are fewer resources available to help them transition into society successfully.\n\nShe\u2019s held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can be stabilizing, but if she's working part-time or under low income, that might not provide enough support. Alternatively, maybe having some work history is a positive factor in her stability.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana before and now feels down most of the time. Drug use can affect mental health, which in turn can impact her ability to function socially or job-wise. Chronic substance use is linked to higher recidivism rates because it can lead to more impulsive behaviors.\n\nHer young age (19) might mean she's still developing her skills and has fewer life experiences that could provide context for potential risks. Also, early-life stress from living with five family members when young could contribute to mental health issues or substance abuse problems, which are linked to reoffending.\n\nShe believes in God\u2019s influence on her life. Religious factors can sometimes lead to different coping mechanisms or a sense of accountability, but without more info on how that affects her behavior now, it's hard to say if it's protective or not.\n\nPutting this all together: The lack of education is a strong risk factor (high). Drug use and feeling down contribute to instability or negative emotions (medium). Age might be a mitigating factor, but combined with other issues, maybe it doesn't offset everything. Living alone could either help or hurt depending on the support network she has.\n\nThe high risk from her educational status seems like it would push the prediction towards YES for recidivism in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"high\", \"She has one arrest without a conviction, which may indicate potential vulnerabilities.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college can hinder her ability to transition positively.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana and feeling down can lead to instability or impulsive behaviors related to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
