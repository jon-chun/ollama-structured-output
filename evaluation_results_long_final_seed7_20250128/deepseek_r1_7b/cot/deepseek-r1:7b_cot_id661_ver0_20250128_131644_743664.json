    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with assigning a relative weight to each risk factor for an 18-year-old male from an Asian/Pacific Islander background. He's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which might be more of a mitigating factor, but being of legal age could indicate he's considered an adult already. His race as Asian/Pacific Islander doesn't directly impact risk unless there are specific stereotypes in the system, but generally, it's not a strong predicting factor.\n\nHe has one prior conviction and was arrested once. Recidivism is higher among those with prior convictions, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they aren't indicators of criminal behavior or risk.\n\nLiving alone isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own unless there's something about the environment that suggests instability, but given no other factors, it might be low to medium. However, since he has a high school diploma and isn't in college, maybe he's more stable now than when he was younger.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone\u2014again, not directly related to risk unless there's something about his current situation affecting his ability to make good decisions, but that's speculative. So perhaps low or medium.\n\nHis job history\u2014he held one job during the year. That might suggest some stability, so maybe lower risk from this factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities. This should be high.\n\nNo depressive episode in the past month\u2014this could indicate he's mentally stable enough to handle his current situation, which might mitigate some risk factors but doesn't directly predict recidivism as strongly as substance use.\n\nHis early life was with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Growing up in such a setting isn't inherently bad unless there are issues within that environment, like neglect or abuse, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe low to medium risk from this factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, so that's a personal belief and doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction is high, drug use is high. Other factors have mixed effects but don't outweigh the two high ones. Therefore, my prediction is high risk for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which increases the likelihood of recidivism as individuals with a criminal history are more likely to engage in criminal behavior again.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly marijuana and cocaine, is strongly associated with higher rates of recidivism due to impaired judgment and potential involvement in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of three in an urban area does not inherently indicate high risk without additional contextual factors like neglect or abuse which are not mentioned here.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"The absence of recent depressive episodes suggests some level of mental stability, but this alone is not a strong mitigating factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and_adulticity\", \"low\", \"Being 18 years old and legally considered an adult may suggest he has made decisions that reflect responsibility despite his past actions.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job during the year provides some stability but does not directly indicate a reduced risk of criminal behavior or rearrest.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
