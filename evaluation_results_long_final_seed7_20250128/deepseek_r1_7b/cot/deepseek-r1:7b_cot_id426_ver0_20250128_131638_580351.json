    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of a 20-year-old female who has been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20, which might indicate she's still developing her skills and could be more prone to mistakes. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe her situation isn't as severe.\n\nShe identifies as White, which can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to systemic factors, but that depends on the context here.\n\nShe has a criminal history with one arrest, so that's a point towards increased risk. However, since it's not a conviction, perhaps it's less severe than if she had multipleConvictions.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 120 lbs. BMI-wise, that's underweight for her height. Underweight individuals might have weaker muscles and could be at higher risk of accidents or violence-related issues.\n\nMarried but living alone suggests she might not have support, which can increase stress and substance use, both of which are risk factors.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED, indicating she may not have the necessary education to avoid getting into trouble again. Not being enrolled in college could mean she's not seeking help or changing her situation.\n\nHaving held only one job might limit her earning potential and provide opportunities for advancement, but it also means she might be relying on that single source of income, making her vulnerable if the job becomes unstable.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is concerning. Drug abuse can lead to other crimes like driving under influence or becoming a drug supplier, increasing recidivism chances.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, but substance abuse often leads to mood issues, so maybe she's dealing with mental health challenges that could affect her decision-making.\n\nFrom a young age, living with her biological mother in a household of five might indicate family dysfunction or neglect, which can have long-term effects on her behavior and mental state.\n\nHer belief that God doesn't influence her personal life suggests she may not have strong spiritual support, which is often associated with better substance use and moral decision-making.\n\nPutting all these together, the factors pointing towards higher risk are the arrest history, lack of education, drug use, living alone, and family background. The positive factors like age being relatively young might somewhat mitigate some risks, but overall, her situation seems to increase the likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"A 20-year-old individual is still developing their skills and may be more prone to mistakes which could influence criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Criminal History\", \"low\", \"She has one arrest but no conviction which might not have severe consequences compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"BMI\", \"medium\", \"Underweight individuals can sometimes face physical risks such as accidents or violence related issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone despite being married may lead to increased stress and substance use which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lack of education could translate into a reduced ability to secure future employment or avoid further involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job might make her vulnerable if the job becomes unstable or if she relies heavily on it for stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) significantly increases the risk of engaging in criminal activities such as drug distribution or theft.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed despite substance use could indicate possible underlying mental health issues that might affect decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five suggests potential family dysfunction which can lead to behavioral and emotional issues.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious support may correlate with poorer substance use and better moral decision-making which could influence recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
