    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. That's relatively young, but considering he has a lot of prior convictions and arrest history, maybe it doesn't compensate for that. He has been arrested nine times and convicted, so that's a high number of negative factors.\n\nHe's male, which can sometimes be a risk factor in certain recidivism situations, though it depends on the jurisdiction. Being white might not directly correlate to higher risk unless there are systemic issues at play elsewhere.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 187 lbs. That doesn't immediately indicate anything about his risk, so probably low impact here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stability from a partner could be a positive factor, reducing recidivism risk compared to someone who's homeless or single.\n\nLack of high school diploma or GED is significant because education levels are strongly linked to lower recidivism rates. Not having this at 21 might indicate he struggled in school or perhaps has other personal issues that led him down a path.\n\nHe's held five jobs during the year, which suggests some level of employability and ability to support himself. However, if job stability is an issue, maybe not being employed full-time could increase risk elsewhere.\n\nDrug use history for four years but only recently in the past month when he felt down. That might indicate recent relapse or stressors leading to substance use, which can affect mental health and self-control, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\n\nEarly life living with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area could have both positive aspects like family support and negative aspects like exposure to circumstances that might have negatively impacted his development. The mention that God doesn't play a role in his personal decisions suggests he may be influenced by other factors, possibly leading to unstable relationships or decision-making.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: high prior convictions (9), drug use, lack of education, living with family, and his personal beliefs about religion affecting his decisions. These points seem to lean towards higher risk. The job history is positive but doesn't necessarily offset the other negatives.\n\nI think this person has a high risk of rearrest within three years based on these factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual's age, while young at 21, does not fully compensate for a history of multiple arrests and convictions which significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED may indicate challenges in education that could contribute to recidivism risk but is not as significant as other factors like substance use or unstable living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with his spouse suggests stability, which can positively influence recidivism risk compared to individuals who are homeless or living alone due to family support and emotional stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"A history of drug use for four years, especially recent relapse, increases the risk of substance abuse, which is a known factor in recidivism.
