    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested once, convicted, which is a solid point against him. His age is quite young, just 18, which might mean he's still in a phase where he's making decisions that could have long-term consequences. \n\nHe's never married and living alone\u2014maybe that contributes to him being more on his own, which isn't great for finding support if something goes wrong. He has a high school diploma but isn't college-bound, so maybe he doesn't have the skills or resources needed to improve his situation.\n\nHe worked two jobs in the past year; that's better than nothing, but working hard might not necessarily translate into positive outcomes. No drug use for four years is a good sign, which could indicate discipline and responsibility. Not feeling depressed in the past month also points towards a stable mental state, which is positive.\n\nLooking at his background, he lived with two people when young, so maybe he had some support then but now isn't getting it. His belief in God might help him stay on track or make better decisions if needed.\n\nPutting all this together, while there are some mitigating factors like no drug use and stable mental health, the main factors that could push him back into trouble are his age, lack of support, and past convictions. I think he's at a low risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one prior arrest and conviction, which is a mitigating factor but does not guarantee no future offenses.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Being 18 years old may indicate he is still in a phase where decisions could lead to negative consequences without the experience of adulthood's wiser judgment.\"),\n    (\"support_system\", \"low\", \"Living alone and never married suggests limited support network, which can contribute to isolation and potential delinquency if not properly supported.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Currently holding only a high school diploma may limit his ability to secure better opportunities or skills that could aid in reintegration and preventing recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year demonstrates some financial stability, which can be beneficial but does not directly correlate with reduced risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates discipline and responsibility, which are positive factors that reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests a stable mental state, which is favorable for preventing recidivism.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Living alone at an early age may have provided limited stability or support during formative years, contributing to potential isolation later on.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Believing in God may provide some internal support but does not directly correlate with reduced risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
