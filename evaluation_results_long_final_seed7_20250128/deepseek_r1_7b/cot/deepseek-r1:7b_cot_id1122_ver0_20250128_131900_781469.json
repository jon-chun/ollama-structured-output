    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 20-year-old Black male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a mitigating factor because it shows he's aware of his actions and hasn't fully embraced criminal behavior yet. So that's low risk.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 160 lbs. Weight can sometimes be an indicator, but without knowing if he's overweight or how much he exercises, it's hard to tell. Maybe medium risk because obesity is a risk factor for recidivism, but not sure here.\n\nNot married and living alone might mean he doesn't have a stable environment. Family support can help reduce recidivism, so this could be high risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he has limited education. Education is linked to lower recidivism rates, so this would increase the risk\u2014high.\n\nHe's worked two jobs during the year. Having some income can provide stability and reduce dependency on illegal activities. Medium risk because even with work, other factors might influence his behavior.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Also, recent feelings of low mood which could be substance-related or other stressors. Substance abuse is a big risk factor for recidivism\u2014high.\n\nHe lived at a young age with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. High risk because living in crowded, possibly dysfunctional households can lead to unstable behavior and higher chances of reoffending.\n\nBelieves in God as part of what happens to him. Support from religion or strong moral values can reduce recidivism. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: Drug use is the biggest concern, followed by living situation and lack of education. The arrest itself isn't a conviction, so maybe he's more motivated this time. I'd lean towards high risk but not super certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"His single non-convicted arrest suggests awareness and potential motivation for change.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"medium\", \"Potential obesity risk without knowing activity levels, which could correlate with substance use or instability.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living situation may lack support, potentially increasing risk of reoffending in a crowded environment.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can lead to lower stability and higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Two job experiences provide some income but may not offer consistent stability or change motivation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine, with recent mood issues, suggests ongoing substance-related challenges.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing/Life Environment\", \"high\", \"Living in a large household might indicate past instability affecting his current behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God may offer some moral support but doesn't necessarily guarantee stability.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
