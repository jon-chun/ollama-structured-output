    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 20-year-old male rearresting within three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism because people might be more stable or have better job opportunities, but since he hasn't held any jobs and has used drugs, maybe his education is less impactful here. I'm thinking medium risk from this factor.\n\nNext, he's never married and not living alone. Social support usually reduces stress, so maybe lower risk here. But it's a bit of an indicator that he might be in a tough situation without family or friends to support him. Maybe it's low but not the highest risk.\n\nHe uses drugs, both marijuana and cocaine, especially recently. Drug use is a strong indicator of unstable behavior and increased impulsivity, which can lead to more serious crimes or substance-related issues. Definitely high risk from this factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment might expose him to family dynamics that could be negative, but since it's rural and at a young age, maybe the impact isn't as severe as if he had a troubled home later on. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which can lead to risky behaviors like self-harm or substance abuse. Belief in a higher power often provides guidance, so the lack of belief could increase his likelihood of negative actions. High risk from this factor.\n\nConsidering he has a criminal history with one arrest and conviction, that's a significant red flag. Previous convictions, especially for violent offenses, greatly increase the chance of recidivism. Definitely high here.\n\nHe feels down much of the time and hasn't held any jobs. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substances or other unstable behaviors, so high risk from this factor as well.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple factors point towards a high risk. Education isn't helping his situation, substance use is problematic, living in a challenging household early on without strong support, and personal beliefs are influencing his behavior negatively. Plus, a criminal history adds to the risk.\n\nI think the overall prediction would be that he has a high chance of rearrest within three years. The confidence level should reflect this because several key factors are pointing towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High school diploma but not enrolled in college\", \"medium\", \"His lack of job experience and involvement in substance use may indicate a lower likelihood of immediate gainful employment, which could influence his stability and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Never married and not living alone\", \"low\", \"Living situation with family might provide some support, reducing potential stressors and behavioral risks associated with being alone\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) in past four years; recent use during the past month\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is strongly linked to unstable behavior and increased impulsivity, significantly elevating recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Living at age 20 with biological mother in a household of size 4 in rural area\", \"medium\", \"Early family dynamics can influence risk behaviors; however, the rural setting might offer limited exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"Does not believe in God and feels down often without any job experience\", \"high\", \"A lack of religious support may contribute to risky behaviors such as self-harm or substance abuse, further increasing recidivism likelihood\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
