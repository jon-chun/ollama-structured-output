    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 19-year-old female having a rearrest within three years. Let's break down all the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has one arrest but no conviction. That alone might not be too bad, but it could indicate some issues she's facing that led her to being stopped before being convicted. Maybe she's in some trouble again now because of that initial encounter.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 140 lbs. Her weight isn't directly a risk factor unless it affects her ability to perform certain jobs, but since she's not employed or enrolled in college, maybe that's not relevant here.\n\nLiving alone is something I've heard can be a double-edged sword. It might mean she has less support around her, which could contribute to substance use issues, like the fact that she hasn't used drugs in the past four years\u2014so maybe that's a positive? But if she's feeling down and not connected with others, that could lead to substance abuse or self-harm.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means she might have struggled academically. Lack of education can sometimes make people look for other ways to get ahead, which could involve illegal activities or more risky behavior. Plus, not being enrolled in college could mean she's avoiding responsibilities that come with higher education.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Joblessness can be a red flag because it might mean she doesn't have the skills needed for stable employment. Without income support, she might turn to other things like drugs or unstable living situations, which aren't indicated here but could still contribute indirectly.\n\nHer drug use is actually zero in the past four years, so that's a positive. But her emotional state says she feels down most of the time and nothing cheers her up. That could lead to self-harm attempts if she's feeling overwhelmed or hopeless.\n\nShe had foster care at an early age with a household size of five. Growing up in such a large family might have caused some stress, but it also taught her responsibility and other skills that might be beneficial. However, the fact that she considers God as not affecting her life could indicate a lack of spiritual support or guidance which sometimes correlates with higher recidivism.\n\nHer belief in God might influence her behavior; if she feels disconnected from a higher power, she might turn to other outlets like drugs, alcohol, or other risky behaviors. But since she's not using drugs right now and is feeling down, that's confusing. Maybe she's considering self-harm because of the lack of support.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior arrest without conviction, low education, living alone, emotional issues, foster care experience\u2014these factors are pushing towards a higher risk. The low drug use but high emotional distress might mitigate some, but the overall context points to moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction may indicate underlying issues that could reoccur if not addressed effectively.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lack of a diploma or GED might limit opportunities and contribute to risky behavior patterns.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangement\", \"high\", \"Living alone can isolate an individual, potentially leading to substance abuse or emotional distress which may correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down most of the time without support could lead to self-harm attempts, indicating moderate risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Foster Care Experience\", \"high\", \"Early foster care in a large household might have contributed to emotional instability or lack of positive life skills, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests effective intervention and lower immediate risk, but it's crucial to monitor for potential misuse triggers.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
