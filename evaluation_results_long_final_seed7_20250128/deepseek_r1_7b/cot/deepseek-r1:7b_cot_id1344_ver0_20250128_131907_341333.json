    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for an 18-year-old female. I need to consider each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Young adults often have fewer recidivist tendencies because they're still developing skills and life experiences. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nHer Hispanic identity doesn't directly impact risk unless there are systemic issues, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, it might be more about personal factors than her heritage. Still, I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe has two arrests but no convictions. Being arrested is a warning sign, but without a conviction, the risk isn't as high because she's not legally barred from reoffending.\n\nShe's 5'0\" and 120 lbs. Weight doesn't typically predict recidivism unless related to substance use or health issues, which aren't indicated here.\n\nNot married and living with others adds some stability. Living in a household of four suggests she has support, which usually reduces risk factors.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign as education can lead to better job opportunities and reduced criminal tendencies.\n\nThree jobs in a year might indicate inconsistency or maybe she's working part-time, but without more info, I'll assume it's not directly related to recidivism.\n\nNo drug use for four years is excellent. Drug abuse is a major driver of recidivism.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month; mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior if untreated, so this is low risk.\n\nConsidering her household size at a young age might indicate she's been supported well, reducing future risk factors.\n\nHer belief in God suggests strong moral values but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are underlying issues not mentioned here.\n\nPutting it all together: no prior convictions, stable living situation, good education and employment history, no drug use, positive mental health. These factors lean towards low risk. The prediction would be \"NO\" for rearrest within three years, high confidence because of the favorable circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 18, which typically indicates a young individual with fewer life experiences and lower recidivist tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"She has two arrests but no convictions, so the risk associated with prior legal issues is mitigated.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being Hispanic does not directly correlate with higher recidivism unless systemic factors are considered, which are not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"Her height (5'0\") and weight (120 lbs) do not typically predict recidivism unless related to health issues, which are not mentioned.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not married but living with others adds some instability, potentially indicating past challenges that could affect future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"She is enrolled in school and has held three jobs during the year; employment history alone does not strongly predict recidivism but can be positive if stable.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use for four years, which reduces risk factors related to substance abuse that often contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Has not felt depressed over the past month; untreated mental health issues are a known risk factor but without such indicators, it is low risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of four at a young age, which may indicate prior support and stability that could reduce future risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believes in God, which can contribute to moral values but does not directly correlate with recidivism without other negative factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
