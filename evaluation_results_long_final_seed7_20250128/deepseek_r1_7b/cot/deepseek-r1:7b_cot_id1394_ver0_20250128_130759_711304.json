    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old Black male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has one arrest but no conviction. That might be a low to medium risk because not being convicted could mean he didn't face severe consequences, maybe it was minor or he got off easily.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they're just physical attributes without any info on health or behavior related to drug use.\n\nHe's living alone, which is a medium risk. Living at home can sometimes lead to dependency issues, but since he's an adult, maybe it's less of a direct indicator.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college \u2013 that might be low risk. Education usually correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism, so being educated could reduce his chances.\n\nHe's worked three jobs during the year. Working multiple jobs is usually positive as it shows responsibility and support for himself, which would lower the risk of recidivism.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but specifically felt low in the past month. That's a medium risk. While drug use can be problematic, if he's currently managing it, maybe that's a mitigating factor compared to someone who's heavily dependent or hasn't sought help.\n\nYoung age and living with his mother at home when young could indicate family influences. Sometimes, growing up in a certain environment might have issues, but without more info on family dynamics, I can only assume it's medium risk.\n\nHis belief in God is positive; spirituality often correlates with better mental health, which would be good for recidivism rates.\n\nPutting all these together: low risk from education and job stability, medium from arrest, living alone, and drug use. The belief in God adds a positive influence.\n\nSo overall prediction: Low to no high risk. Maybe 80% confidence because most factors are mitigating except the arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"His one arrest but no conviction may indicate low risk as it suggests he did not face severe consequences for his actions.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"He is currently living alone, which could be a mitigating factor but doesn't directly correlate with high recidivism risk without further context on dependency issues or living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"He has used drugs in the past four years and felt low during the last month.
