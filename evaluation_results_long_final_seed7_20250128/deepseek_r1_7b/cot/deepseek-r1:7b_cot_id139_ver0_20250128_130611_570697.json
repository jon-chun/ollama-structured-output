    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query from someone who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided specific details about a 20-year-old female and asked for an analysis of her risk factors over three years leading to rearrest recidivism. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst off, she's Black, which is interesting because I know there are systemic issues in the justice system that might affect her outcomes compared to others. She has one arrest but no conviction, so maybe she's still navigating the system without a full sentence. Her height and weight don't seem directly relevant here; it's more about her personal circumstances.\n\nShe lives alone and isn't married, which could mean less support network and potentially higher isolation risk. High school diploma suggests some education but no college, so maybe limited job opportunities or skills that aren't in demand. She's worked two jobs during the year, which is positive as employment can reduce recidivism, especially if it's stable.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana over four years might indicate ongoing substance abuse issues, which can affect mental health and self-control. Her recent feelings of low mood for a month could be linked to depression or anxiety, both tied to higher recidivism rates. \n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area suggests she's been part of a family system that might have different dynamics compared to other environments. Her spirituality believing in God could offer some coping mechanisms and positive influences.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: one arrest, no conviction; living alone (medium risk); drug use (medium), mood issues (low but still relevant); limited education (low); part-time work (positive). I need to weigh each factor's impact on rearrest. \n\nArrest without conviction might have some weight because it could indicate potential for reoffending if not addressed. Her living situation and mood are significant factors that could predict higher risk. Employment, despite being part-time, is a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting this all together, I think she has a low to medium risk of rearrest. But given her living alone and recent drug use with mood issues, it's probably on the lower end. So maybe a low confidence prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Education\", \"low\", \"The individual is 20 years old with a high school diploma, which may limit her employment opportunities and educational resources that could reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases the risk of isolation and potential substance abuse issues, which are known predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"While she has a history of drug use (marijuana), recent feelings of low mood may indicate a temporary lapse in substance use rather than a long-term dependency, which could be addressed with appropriate support services.\"),\n    (\"Mood and Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Feeling down for a significant portion of the month could be a sign of underlying mental health issues, which are often linked to higher recidivism rates if not managed effectively.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"She has held two jobs during the year, which is a positive factor as employment can reduce recidivism risk by providing financial stability and reducing substance abuse-related stress.\"), \n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of three may indicate a stable family environment that could positively influence her mental health and decision-making abilities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
