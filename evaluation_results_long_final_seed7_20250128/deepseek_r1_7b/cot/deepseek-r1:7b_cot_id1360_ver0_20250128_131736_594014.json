    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of this 22-year-old Black female with a rearrest recidivism prediction. Let me break down her factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she has two arrests but no convictions. That might not be too bad on its own since convictions are more impactful. But her drug use in the past four years (marijuana) is concerning. Drug use can often lead to more issues or substance abuse problems later on, which could increase her risk of reoffending.\n\nShe's living alone without a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This indicates she might not have the resources or support system needed for success. Plus, not having any job experience during the year is a red flag\u2014lack of income can lead to unstable situations where she might turn to criminal activities again.\n\nHer early life was tough with living with her biological mother at age 2 in a household of two. That's a strong indicator of potential future issues like dependency or family dysfunction, which are risk factors for recidivism.\n\nShe mentions considering God's role in her life, which is positive and suggests she might stay involved in her spiritual life\u2014something that can contribute positively but isn't directly a risk factor unless it's inconsistent with other behaviors.\n\nPutting all this together: two minor arrests, drug use, lack of education and job experience, and a tough early life. These factors are significant and point towards a higher risk. So I'm leaning towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Two previous arrests but no convictions\", \"medium\", \"Having past criminal history, even without conviction, can indicate possible re-offending tendencies and should be considered in the risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to substance abuse problems, mental health issues, or increased impulsivity, all of which may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone without education or employment\", \"high\", \"Lack of educational attainment and job experience can impair personal stability and opportunities for positive development, increasing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Young age (22) with a history of living with biological mother in a household of two at a young age\", \"high\", \"Early family environment issues are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential emotional or developmental challenges that may persist into adulthood and contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Consideration of God's role in personal life (positive)\", \"low\", \"Positive spiritual involvement can be seen as a protective factor, offsetting some of the high-risk factors mentioned above.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
