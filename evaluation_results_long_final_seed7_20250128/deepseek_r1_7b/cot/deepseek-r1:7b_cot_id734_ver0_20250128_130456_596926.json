    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with four arrests and two convictions. That seems pretty significant. Recidivism is often linked to prior offenses, so that's definitely high risk.\n\nHis age being 21 isn't super old, but it's also not too young. Young adults might be more volatile, but I don't know if his age alone makes him high risk without other factors.\n\nHe's White, which historically has had some disparities in the criminal justice system. But without specific data linking race to recidivism in this case, I can't say for sure. Maybe it's not as impactful here.\n\nStanding at 5'10\" and weighing 215 lbs \u2013 that makes him quite heavy. Being overweight can lead to health issues which might contribute to substance abuse or stressors affecting his behavior.\n\nHe's living alone with no married partner, so he doesn't have a support network. Lack of support can mean he's more isolated and might not seek help when needed, increasing the risk.\n\nNo job during the year is concerning. Joblessness can lead to financial instability and lack of purpose, both of which are known contributors to recidivism. Plus, without income, he might turn to other substances or negative activities as a coping mechanism.\n\nDrug use history \u2013 he used marijuana in the past four years and felt low in the past month. Substance abuse can impair judgment, lead to risky behaviors, and has direct health impacts. It's also a known factor in recidivism.\n\nHe had a big household when young, size six. That could indicate family dysfunction or a lot of stress from living with many people. Family dynamics can influence behavior throughout life, so that might be another red flag.\n\nHis belief that God doesn't affect his personal life suggests he may have a lack of spiritual support or guidance. Without this kind of support, he might not find the same level of guidance and help in navigating any challenges.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, living alone with no support, substance use issues, family history, and age factors into a high risk assessment. The prior convictions are a strong indicator because they directly relate to past behavior that could predict future actions.\n\nSo, I think this person has a high relative weight for each factor, leading me to predict a YES for rearrest within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Individual has four prior arrests and two convictions, indicating significant criminal history which is strongly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Age and Cohort\", \"low\", \"At 21 years old, the individual may still be in a phase of life that can be influenced by personal choices without established support network or past stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no married partner suggests limited social support which can increase stress and isolation leading to potential substance abuse issues and lack of access to resources for help.\"),\n    (\"Joblessness\", \"high\", \"No job during the year may contribute to financial instability and purposelessness, both known contributors to recidivism as they reduce motivation and access to alternative activities which can aid in positive change or deterrence.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Heavy use of marijuana in past four years with recent feelings of low mood suggests substance abuse issues which impair judgment increase risk of negative behaviors and have direct health impacts that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Dynamics\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of six at a young age could indicate family dysfunction or stressors that influence behavior later in life, potentially affecting decision-making and self-control mechanisms.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief that God has no effect on personal life may suggest lack of spiritual guidance which can be a source of support for navigating life challenges and making positive choices which could mitigate recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",
