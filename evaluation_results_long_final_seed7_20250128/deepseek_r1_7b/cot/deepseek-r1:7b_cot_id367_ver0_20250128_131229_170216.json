    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine the risk of a potential recidivism for an 18-year-old female based on her background. She has four prior arrests and convictions, which is a significant red flag. Her age being high school senior status might mean she's more focused on education now.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which can contribute to isolation but maybe also provides some stability if she's managing her situation well. Being in school should help with job retention as she pursues higher education.\n\nHowever, her past drug use, particularly marijuana, is concerning. Drug abuse often correlates with unstable behavior or increased risk of other criminal activities. Also, her recent feelings of low mood might indicate underlying mental health issues that could affect her ability to function responsibly.\n\nHer early life living with her biological mother in a household of four in an urban area suggests she might have experienced some trauma or neglect, which can impact her coping mechanisms and decision-making later on. Her lack of belief in God could relate to her personal struggles but may not directly correlate with criminal behavior unless it leads to further mental health issues.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the prior convictions alone would make me lean towards high risk. The other factors like drug use and possible mood issues also support a high-risk assessment. I think predicting a YES for rearrest within three years is reasonable with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as past behavior patterns may indicate impulsivity or disregard for legal consequences.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 18 years old, she is nearing high school senior status and is likely focused on education rather than criminal activity, reducing the immediate risk despite her prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (particularly marijuana) in the past four years may indicate potential for continued substance abuse, which can contribute to risky behavior or strained relationships, increasing the likelihood of future involvement in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"mood issues\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for an extended period could signal underlying mental health issues that may affect decision-making and responsibility, further contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family History\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of four in an urban area, along with lack of belief in God, suggests possible exposure to trauma or neglect, which can impact her ability to function responsibly and make sound decisions that avoid criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 162 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
