    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a risk weight to each of the provided factors for this individual and then predict their rearrest recidivism over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: He's 21. Younger individuals might be less established, but since he has four prior arrests and convictions, that's more concerning. So high risk because of the criminal history despite his age.\n\nRace: He identifies as White. Generally, racial factors can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, so medium risk. But it's not the most significant factor here.\n\nNumber of prior arrests and convictions: Four times and four convictions. That's a strong indicator of past behavior leading to trouble, definitely high risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'8\" and between 175-199 lbs. While height can be a risk factor in certain contexts like domestic violence, there's no info here about that. Weight is more about overall health; again, not directly tied without additional data, so maybe medium or low.\n\nLiving alone: Yes, currently living alone. Living situation can affect support systems and stress levels. Without support, he might face higher stress which could lead to substance use issues. So perhaps medium risk here.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor; lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates. High risk because of this.\n\nJob status: Haven't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substances, unemployment benefits, etc., which are known predictors of recidivism. High risk for this reason.\n\nDrug use history: Used marijuana in the past four years and felt down often recently. Drug use is a significant indicator; regular substance use can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behaviors, leading to more crimes or reoffending. High risk here.\n\nYouth environment: At a young age lived with biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. Being raised in such an environment might contribute to higher risk due to exposure to negative influences or lack of stability. Medium to high; maybe medium as it's at a young age but not certain about the impact without more context.\n\nReligion: Believes God has no role in his personal life. This could affect self-esteem and cope with stress, potentially leading to substance abuse issues which are linked to recidivism. Medium risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: High prior convictions, no education, unemployment, living alone, drug use, and a young, unstable family background. All these factors point towards high risk of rearrest. The probability is quite high, maybe around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully evaluating each factor related to the individual's history, current circumstances, and potential influences on recidivism, it appears that his likelihood of reoffending within three years is significantly high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Young individuals may be less established in life, increasing their risk despite having a prior criminal record.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Racial factors can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues, though not the most significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests and convictions indicate a history of problematic behavior leading to trouble.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No specific information on health impacts from height/weight unless related to domestic violence or substance use, which isn't provided here.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase stress levels, potentially affecting mental health and substance use, both linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not enrolled in college correlates with higher recidivism rates due to dependency on substances and lack of support.\"),\n    (\"Job Status\", \"high\", \"Not holding a job can lead to dependency on substances, unemployment benefits, etc., all known predictors of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Regular marijuana use and recent feelings of low mood suggest substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Youth Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of three in an urban area may contribute to exposure to negative influences but doesn't directly indicate high risk without more context.\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"medium\", \"Belief that God has no role could affect coping mechanisms and stress, potentially linked to substance abuse issues which are risk factors for recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
