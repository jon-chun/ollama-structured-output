    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 20-year-old Black male for rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has an arrest history of eight times with four convictions. That seems significant because a high number of past offenses can indicate a tendency to reoffend. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe is tall at 7 feet 8 inches and weighs 160 lbs. That makes him look imposing, but I don't think physical characteristics directly contribute to criminal recidivism unless there are specific issues like substance abuse or domestic violence, which aren't mentioned here. So maybe medium impact because he might be in a high-risk environment, but not directly related.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse and no children, so that's probably low risk regarding family dynamics since he doesn't have support structure, but the other factors might outweigh this.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Educational barriers can sometimes be a red flag because they might indicate past difficulties which could lead to substance abuse or other issues contributing to recidivism. So medium risk here.\n\nHe's employed two jobs in the past year, which is positive as job stability often leads to better opportunities and less time in prison. That would lower his risk factor.\n\nHis drug use: he used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't recently. However, he feels down for the last month, which might be a sign of underlying mental health issues or stressors that could lead to substance abuse relapse. This is medium risk because while he doesn't use now, the mood state suggests potential triggers.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area when young. That's a high-risk factor for child welfare because living in such a large family might have led to neglect or abuse issues. This could be linked to behavioral problems later on, increasing recidivism chances significantly.\n\nLastly, he believes in God and thinks it affects his personal life. While this isn't directly tied to criminal behavior, religious factors can sometimes influence substance use or stress responses, which are risk factors. So medium to high depending on how it correlates with other behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the prior convictions (high), living situation (high), possible mental health issues (medium), and lack of education (medium) point towards a high risk overall. The job stability is positive but outweighed by other negative factors.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis, here's the structured response:\n\n**Risk Factors:**\n1. **High Risk:** Past Arrests (8 times with 4 convictions)\n2. **High Risk:** Living Situation in a Household of 6\n3. **Medium Risk:** Job Stability (two jobs but positive)\n4. **Medium Risk:** Drug Use and Mood State\n\n**Prediction:** YES (High confidence)\n\nThe individual has significant past criminal history, living in an environment that may correlate with neglect, and potential underlying mental health issues indicated by his mood state. These factors collectively point towards a high risk of rearrest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrests\", \"high\", \"High risk due to eight prior arrests with four convictions indicating past criminal behavior and possible tendencies to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of six may correlate with neglect or abuse, increasing behavioral risks.\"),\n    (\"job_stability\", \"medium\", \"Employed two jobs showing some positive stability but not sufficient to outweigh other risk factors.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_mood_state\", \"medium\", \"Drug use history and current mood state suggest potential triggers for relapse despite no recent drug use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
