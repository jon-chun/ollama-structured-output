Her age might be a factor since younger individuals sometimes have different patterns, but she hasn't had much time to rebuild her life after arrest.\n\nShe lives alone, which could mean she doesn't have support from family or friends who might help her stay on track. Being in the workforce part-time without a high school diploma is another point\u2014maybe she's struggling with job skills or motivation. Using drugs, especially recently, can affect her mental state and ability to function responsibly.\n\nHer past household size was four when she was young; maybe that contributed to some instability or lack of supervision. Her religious beliefs might make her more prone to making poor decisions driven by anger or hopelessness rather than seeking a higher purpose.\n\nPutting it all together, several risk factors are present: prior arrest, low education, substance use, living alone, and personal history which adds to her unstable circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"She has one previous conviction, indicating a history of criminal behavior that could predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living in isolation may increase stress and substance use, potentially leading to increased risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, with recent heavy use, can impair judgment and self-control, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED may indicate limited opportunities for positive role models or educational support, contributing to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Young Age and Household Size at 18\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of four at a young age might not directly correlate with higher risk unless it indicates ongoing instability.

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 138 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
