    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a relative weight to each risk factor for this 19-year-old male to predict his rearrest recidivism over the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. I think that's important because being arrested is an indicator of potential issues, but since it's not a conviction yet, maybe it's low risk? Or perhaps it could still be medium if he's showing signs of trouble.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 160 lbs. Weight alone doesn't seem like a big issue here unless there are health complications, which aren't mentioned. So probably low risk related to his physical stats.\n\nNot married and living alone might suggest some instability, but without more info on whether he has support systems or issues, maybe it's medium because living alone can sometimes be a red flag for other problems.\n\nHe's in school now, so he's actively seeking education. That's usually good for recidivism because it shows commitment to positive change. So probably low risk here.\n\nHe held one job during the year, which is better than not working at all. Stable employment often leads to lower recidivism rates, so another low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and only feeling down recently. That's a good sign; substance abuse can be a major contributor to recidivism, but since he hasn't used drugs, that's a positive. Maybe medium because recent feelings of low mood might not necessarily indicate substance issues yet.\n\nAt a young age, lived in a household of five. A larger family could imply more support or maybe more challenges at home, which could be medium risk if it's causing problems. But again, without knowing specifics, I'll go with medium.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. That's more about personal belief and could influence motivation towards positive behavior. Maybe low risk because it suggests he's seeking a higher purpose, which is generally associated with lower recidivism.\n\nNow, compiling all these factors, most of them seem to point toward low risk except maybe the household size if there were issues within that family. But since we don't have info on that, I'll lean towards low overall risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrests\", \"low\", \"Being arrested twice but not convicted indicates potential issues without a conviction, which could be low risk depending on other factors.\"),\n    (\"physical_Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not inherently suggest high risk without health complications, which are not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate instability but may also offer some independence unless there are underlying issues.\"),\n    (\" employment_status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school shows active pursuit of education, a positive indicator for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Held one job during the year, which is better than not working and generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"No drug use in the past four years but recent feelings of low mood could indicate potential substance issues or stress without explicit evidence.\"),\n    (\"family_size\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of five, which may imply support but also possible challenges that are not detailed here.\"),\n    (\"religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God associated with seeking higher purpose and positive motivation, generally linked to lower recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
