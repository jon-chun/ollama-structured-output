    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he has two arrests but no convictions. Since it's not a full conviction, the risk is lower than someone with a felony record. So maybe low here.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism risk, so probably medium or low.\n\nHe\u2019s living alone, which can be a protective factor because isolation might lead to seeking help rather than engaging in criminal activities. So maybe low.\n\nNo prior marriage means he's not in a stable relationship that could influence his behavior towards substance use. So another low factor.\n\nHaving a GED and not in college might suggest some educational drive, but it could also indicate someone who is motivated to change. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe only held one job recently, which doesn't necessarily correlate with high risk if he's been stable at work. But maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use can sometimes be linked to more casual drug use and less severe substance issues compared to say, alcohol oropiods. So perhaps low risk from that perspective.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate he's mentally stable enough to not engage in harmful behaviors. That would lean towards low risk.\n\nYoung age at first arrest is a bit concerning because younger individuals sometimes have different motivations and could be more susceptible to substance abuse. This factor might increase his risk slightly, so perhaps medium.\n\nLiving with five people from a young age suggests he's been in environments where he might have learned bad habits or had exposure to criminal influences. That could be a medium-high risk factor as it might indicate lack of supervision or family support which isn't encouraging positive behavior.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life is a significant factor. If someone feels disconnected from a higher power, they might turn to other forms of spirituality or none at all, but this can also be a protective factor because it might reduce the likelihood of seeking help for substance abuse or criminal behavior. Alternatively, if he's using religion as a coping mechanism, maybe that affects his risk differently. But given his statement, I think this leans towards lower risk.\n\nPutting all these together: two low factors (arrests, living with five), one medium (drug use), and several low ones. The only medium factor is drug use. However, considering he's 18, still early in life, and maybe more susceptible to certain influences. So the overall prediction might be medium risk.\n\nBut wait, the young age at first arrest and living with five could tip it slightly higher. Maybe his risk factors are medium because of some protective aspects but also some moderate tendencies due to young age and family background.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Two previous arrests without conviction\", \"low\", \"His two prior arrests, though not leading to convictions, suggest he may have experienced minor setbacks rather than severe criminal behavior.
