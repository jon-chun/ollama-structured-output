    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a primary factor in recidivism risk assessment, but it might influence other factors like social support or community trust. Since there's no info on that, maybe it doesn't add much here.\n\nHe has two arrests but not convictions. Without a conviction, the impact might be lower than someone with a full sentence. But two arrests could still indicate prior behavior issues.\n\nHis height is 5'11\" and he weighs 140 lbs. Weight isn't directly predictive of recidivism, so probably low weight here.\n\nHe's never married and currently not living alone. Living arrangement can affect support systems. If he's not with family or friends who might help him, that could be a medium risk factor because isolation is sometimes linked to higher reoffending rates.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a big factor. Not having a degree and not pursuing further education can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again, so this would probably be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs might indicate some stability, but if he's frequently employed or if his employment is inconsistent, it could vary. However, holding four jobs seems positive for job security and economic stability, which usually reduces recidivism.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use can impede reintegration into society and has direct links to criminal behavior, so this would be a low risk factor.\n\nHe felt down during the past month without any Cheerful moments. Emotional issues are often connected to substance abuse or other antisocial behaviors, which could increase risk. So medium here because feeling down might not always directly correlate with criminal behavior but can be a warning sign.\n\nLiving at a young age with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. This is a concerning factor. Young age, living with multiple family members, especially in a rural setting where resources and support may be limited, could increase stress and negative life events that contribute to recidivism. High risk here.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal issues. Lack of strong spiritual or moral support can lead to poor decision-making and increased risk of reoffending. So medium because while it's not a direct cause, it's an indicator of possible underlying issues affecting behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: The factors include two arrests (medium), living in a big family with a rural background (high), no education (high), and emotional issues (medium). The positive points are job history (high) but nullified by the other high factors. Without convictions, maybe lower weight on that. Considering everything, I'd lean towards medium risk because of the significant negative factors like family living situation, lack of education, and possible emotional distress.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Two arrests without convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has two arrests, which may indicate prior behavior issues but no conviction, so it's moderate.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Living with a large family in a rural area\", \"high\", \"Living in a big household in a rural setting can increase stress and lack of support, significantly contributing to risk.\",\n     \"high\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong indicator of potential for reoffending due to limited opportunities and skills.\",\n     \"high\"),\n    (\"Emotional distress without positive feelings\", \"medium\", \"Felt down during the past month, which could impact decision-making but doesn't always directly correlate with criminal behavior.\",\n     \"medium\"),\n    (\"Job history of four positions\", \"high\", \"Held four jobs; while this might indicate stability, it's somewhat mitigated by other high factors like family living situation and education.\",\n     \"high\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
