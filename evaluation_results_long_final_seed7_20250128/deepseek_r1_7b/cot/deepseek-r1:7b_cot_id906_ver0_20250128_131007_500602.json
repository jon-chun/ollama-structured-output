    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of one arrest and one conviction. That might be a medium risk because prior convictions can increase the chance of reoffending, but being only one isn't too bad yet.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 165 lbs. Weight is often a factor in recidivism, but since he has a GED and isn't in college, maybe his lower education could correlate with more stable employment or better living conditions, which might actually reduce risk. But weight alone doesn't determine much without knowing if it's an issue like being overweight.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Maybe living arrangements can affect stress levels and support systems, but since he doesn't feel depressed in the past month, that factor isn't strong here.\n\nHaving a GED and not in college could indicate some level of education that might help him find better opportunities, which would lower recidivism risk. But it's also possible that lack of higher education contributes to his current situation.\n\nHe held 3 jobs during the year. More stable employment usually reduces recidivism because having a job can provide financial stability and reduce stress from unemployment or poverty.\n\nNo drug use in past four years is positive\u2014it suggests he's been clean, which might correlate with better mental health and lower risk of substance abuse-related crimes.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month shows that he's maintaining his mental well-being, which is a good sign for recidivism.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in a household of three. This could mean exposure to family dynamics or potential neglect issues, but since he doesn't feel depressed and has no current issues, maybe this factor isn't as negative now.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: one prior conviction (medium), stable employment (low), positive drug use (high), no depression (high), and living with parents (low). The overall risk would be influenced by the lower end of medium because his prior conviction is a moderate risk, but other positive factors like employment and lack of substance abuse might balance it out.\n\nSo, considering all that, I'd lean towards low relative risk for rearrest recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior conviction which increases the risk slightly but is mitigated by other positive factors like employment and drug use.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"low\", \"Three jobs held during the year indicate stable financial standing, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"No drugs used in past four years suggests a clean lifestyle, which is protective against substance abuse-related crimes.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"No recent depression indicates good mental health, further reducing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of three may not be a significant risk factor currently given positive indicators like employment and mental health.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
