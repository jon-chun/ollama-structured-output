    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to assess this risk. So, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested once but not convicted. He's of average height and weight, living alone without a high school diploma. He's jobless for a year, uses drugs, feels sad often, had a troubled early life with four siblings, and doesn't believe in God.\n\nFirst, the age is 21, which might be considered low risk since it's early adulthood, but he has criminal history despite not being convicted yet. The lack of education could impact his employability and ability to reintegrate into society, so maybe that's a medium factor.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone, which might mean he's less likely to get support from family or friends in the future, affecting his chances of getting help or staying sober. Using drugs past four years is significant; drug use can affect employment, relationships, and overall stability, so that's definitely high risk.\n\nHis early life with four siblings in a big household could have led to neglect or abuse, which often correlates with higher recidivism rates. Believing in God might reduce his ability to seek religious support for recovery, adding another medium factor.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014criminal history, lack of education, living alone, drug use, and troubled early life\u2014the risk seems pretty high. I would lean towards a high relative weight because each factor contributes significantly to the likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Criminal History (No Conviction)\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one arrest but no conviction, which could impact their ability to reintegrate into society and may suggest potential for continued behavior issues.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (No HS Diploma or GED)\", \"low\", \"Lack of education may limit opportunities for better job prospects and support systems, potentially increasing risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (Alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support and increase feelings of isolation, which may influence substance use and other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Past Four Years)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse history is a strong indicator of potential for continued drug use and associated risks, significantly increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Troubled Early Life (Four Siblings in Household)\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing neglect or abuse during early life can contribute to behavioral issues and substance use, moderately increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God (No Relationship)\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief may reduce reliance on support systems related to spiritual guidance for recovery, but this factor alone does not significantly increase risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
