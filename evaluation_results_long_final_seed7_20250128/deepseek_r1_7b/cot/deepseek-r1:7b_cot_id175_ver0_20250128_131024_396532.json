    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 20-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let's break down her profile step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a history of 10 arrests and 5 convictions. That's a significant criminal record, which is definitely high risk because more past crimes typically mean higher chances of reoffending.\n\nShe's married living with her spouse, which usually indicates she's stable. So that might be a medium factor in terms of stability and lower risk compared to someone who's homeless or single.\n\nHer education level is concerning\u2014she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education plays a role in reducing recidivism because having some skills can help her find better opportunities, so this could be a medium factor pushing towards higher risk.\n\nShe's only held one job during the year. Unemployment for that long might indicate she's struggling to get stable employment, which is another medium-high risk factor since joblessness often correlates with other issues leading to re-arrest.\n\nDrug use history is present\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Additionally, she admits feeling down recently, which could be a sign of mental health issues. Drug use can increase impulsive behavior, which is high risk for recidivism.\n\nFrom a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and social stressors, so that's another high factor contributing to potential instability or exposure to negative influences.\n\nShe believes God has no role in her life. This lack of religious support might lead to a lack of spiritual guidance and could affect her decision-making and relationships, which is medium-high risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014high criminal history, unemployment, drug use, living situation, and personal beliefs\u2014it seems like she's at high risk for rearrest. The confidence score should reflect the strength of these contributing elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"She has a significant criminal record with 10 arrests and multiple convictions, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"unstable living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with her spouse suggests stability, but it's not enough to negate the risk associated with her past criminal history and current personal issues.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Her lack of education may limit her opportunities for better employment or support, increasing her risk of re-arrest.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year could indicate financial instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse has been linked to increased impulsivity and higher rates of criminal behavior, making her a high risk factor for rearrest.\"),\n    (\"recent mental health issues\", \"medium-high\", \"Feeling down for extended periods could signal underlying mental health issues that may contribute to risky behaviors or substance use.\"),\n    (\"household environment\", \"high\", \"Living in an urban area with potential exposure to crime and social stressors can increase instability and risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"lack of religious support\", \"medium-high\", \"Her belief system might influence her decision-making and relationships, potentially contributing to risky behaviors or substance use issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
