    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's Black. I remember that being Black can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates in some areas, probably due to systemic issues or past police practices. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested three times but not convicted. Unofficial convictions can still matter because it shows prior involvement and possible instability. That's also high risk.\n\nHis height is 6'6\" and he weighs 195 lbs, which seems like an above-average size for someone his age. Maybe that doesn't directly affect his risk unless there are issues related to weight, but I don't have info on that yet.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can impact relationships which might influence support and stability, so maybe a medium factor here.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive sign as education often leads to better job prospects and lower recidivism. So maybe this lowers the risk, but it depends on other factors.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. One job isn't terrible, but if he was laid off or not stable, that could be concerning. Maybe medium here because job stability matters.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to behavioral issues and substance abuse problems which might increase risk, especially since he's young. So perhaps a high factor due to potential drug-related issues even though he hasn't felt depressed lately.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother at a young age (like 12?) in a household of seven in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and stress from living in crowded, maybe neglectful environments. This could be high risk due to exposure to adversities.\n\nConsidering he believes in God, which is a strong moral compass, this might contribute positively by providing guidance and reducing some negative influences. So that's probably a medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Black background (high), prior arrests (high), drug use (high), living situation (medium), one job (medium), and living with many family members in urban area (high). The positives like education are there but outweighed by the high factors. \n\nI think overall, his risk is moderately high because of the multiple contributing factors, especially from his background and past experiences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Black Background\", \"high\", \"Having a Black background may correlate with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues or past police practices affecting him positively or negatively.\"),\n    (\"Three Unofficial Arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests without convictions can indicate prior involvement and potential instability, which are concerning factors for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Above-Average Weight\", \"medium\", \"While height doesn't directly affect risk unless there's associated weight issues not mentioned here.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living situation alone may influence social support but isn't a direct indicator of high risk without additional context about living conditions or family support\"),\n    (\"One Job During the Year\", \"medium\", \"Employment is generally positive, but holding only one job might indicate possible instability depending on recent changes or financial dependency issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, can lead to behavioral issues and substance abuse which may increase recidivism risk despite not feeling depressed recently.\"),\n    (\"Urban Area Living in a Household of Seven at a Young Age\", \"high\", \"Exposure to urban environments with high crime rates and neglect can significantly impact an individual's mental health and future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Strong religious beliefs may offer guidance but don't inherently reduce risk unless there are specific supportive influences not mentioned here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
