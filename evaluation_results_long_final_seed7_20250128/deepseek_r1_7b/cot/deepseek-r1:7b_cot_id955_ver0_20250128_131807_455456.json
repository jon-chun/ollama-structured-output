    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 20-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. From what I know, there's some evidence suggesting that being White might be associated with slightly lower recidivism rates compared to other ethnic groups, but it's not the most significant factor on its own.\n\nHe has one arrest without a conviction. That's just one point against him, so maybe low weight here.\n\nHis height and weight are 4'11\" and between 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics alone have a big impact unless there's something about his behavior tied to that, which isn't the case here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living arrangements can affect stability, but since he's not married, maybe it's less of an issue.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED. Education is a strong predictor of recidivism; having no diploma probably adds to his risk.\n\nHe's worked three jobs in the past year. Having some work experience might indicate better economic stability and support for reintegration, so maybe that lowers the risk a bit, but it also shows he's been employed enough times.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years. That's a negative factor because substance abuse can lead to other problems affecting his ability to reintegrate society.\n\nHis recent mood state is really bad; he feels down most of the time and nothing cheers him up. This could indicate depression or low self-esteem, which are significant risk factors for recidivism as they might affect his motivation and willingness to change.\n\nEarly life living with five family members in a rural area. That's a tough spot because growing up in a challenging environment can lead to substance abuse, lack of support, etc., all contributing to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God personally. This could mean he has a different outlook on life, which might affect his motivation and support system. However, this alone may not be as significant unless it leads to other negative behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: The drug use (high), lack of education (high), recent bad mood (high) are strong indicators. The rest don't add enough positive factors. So, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have lower recidivism rates compared to other ethnic groups but this factor alone is not a significant contributor to risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"One arrest without a conviction, which is a minor infraction and does not necessarily indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be a source of stress and instability, contributing moderately to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED significantly impacts an individual's ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Three jobs in the past year indicates some financial stability but does not directly correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly marijuana use, is a strong indicator of potential behavioral issues and increased risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Mood State\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of depression or low self-esteem can affect an individual's motivation to reintegrate into society successfully.\"),\n    (\"Early Life Environment\", \"high\", \"Living with five family members in a rural area for a young age may have contributed to negative behaviors such as drug use and low self-esteem.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Non-religious beliefs do not inherently contribute to increased recidivism risk unless they lead to other negative behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
