    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this guy. Let's break down his background step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old White male with one arrest but no conviction. That seems like a minor offense, maybe just a traffic ticket or something. So, maybe low risk there.\n\nHis height and weight don't really tell me much about his risk factors. It's more about other characteristics.\n\nHe's living alone without any relationships, so no support network to help him get back on track. That might be a red flag because having family or friends can provide guidance and reduce recidivism.\n\nNo job experience is another point against him. Without income, it's harder to maintain sobriety or financial stability, which could contribute to relapse.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't recently. He admitted feeling down most of the time. I wonder if that emotional state might affect his ability to make good decisions again.\n\nGrowing up in a household of five with both biological parents suggests he was part of a larger family, which can sometimes lead to more stress or less individualized attention. Plus, his religious beliefs might influence his behavior; maybe he's introspective and could be more prone to bad decisions if not guided by faith.\n\nPutting it all together: one minor arrest, no job, living alone, emotional issues, and a past home environment. These factors seem to point towards a higher risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22-year-old male is relatively young, which might indicate lower recidivism risk compared to older individuals who may face more life challenges.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest but no conviction could be a minor offense, suggesting possible low risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"housing_stability\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is a factor that might increase risk as it removes the stabilizing influence of a support network.\"),\n    (\"joblessness\", \"high\", \"No job experience during the year could indicate financial instability and reduced ability to maintain sobriety or lifestyle goals.\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years, but no recent use, might suggest potential abstinence, reducing risk of drug-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down most months could indicate underlying issues that may contribute to impulsive or risky decisions.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of five with biological parents could imply stressors and potential behavioral influences from an older household that might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Considering God has influence on personal decisions could suggest potential for internal guidance, but may also contribute to emotional issues affecting decision-making.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 220 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
