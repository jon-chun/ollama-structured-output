    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I remember that race can influence recidivism rates, but it's more about systemic factors and less about an individual. So maybe his being White isn't a strong risk factor here.\n\nHe has one arrest without a conviction. That's not a huge deal yet, but it shows some past involvement with the system. Maybe low to medium risk because just one minor offense might not have significant consequences if he's remorseful or gets good support.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here. I think body weight usually doesn't predict recidivism unless there's something about his lifestyle or habits, but those aren't listed.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Unstable living situations are known risk factors for recidivism because they increase the chances of issues like drug abuse or lack of supervision. So maybe medium to high risk here.\n\nHigh school diploma and college enrollment. Education is usually protective against recidivism, so this shouldn't be a strong risk factor. It might even lower his chance of reoffending.\n\nHe's employed two jobs in the past year. Employment can help with financial stability and reduce the temptation to engage in criminal activities, so low risk here.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a clear red flag for future substance abuse, which is a major factor in recidivism. So this should be high risk because drug use can lead to more criminal behavior or increases the chance of relapsing into it.\n\nHe feels no depression recently. Lack of mental health issues might mean he's in better mental condition, so lower risk there. But that also depends on how he got through without depression.\n\nLiving with non-biological parents in a household of three in an urban area at a young age\u2014this sounds like a stressful environment which could contribute to behavioral issues or higher risk-taking. So medium to high risk here because early life experiences can influence future behavior and support systems.\n\nBelieving in God affects his personal beliefs but not directly linked to recidivism unless it relates to his support system, which isn't mentioned. So maybe low impact.\n\nPutting all these together: His drug use is a big concern (high), living with non-biological parents might be a moderate issue (medium). The rest don't seem as significant. So the overall risk factors would lean towards medium but with some high points that could push it to high, making me more confident in predicting a higher chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"His single arrest does not yet indicate a significant criminal history that has led to serious consequences.
