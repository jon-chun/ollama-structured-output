    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: he's been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a significant red flag because prior convictions are strongly predictive of recidivism. So that would be high risk.\n\nNext, his demographics: being Black can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates in some studies, but it might also depend on systemic issues. However, without specific data linking him to such factors, I'll consider it medium since it's a known factor but not certain here.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'8\" and 161 lbs. These aren't red flags themselves unless they're leading to health issues or substance use problems, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's living alone with no job history. Living alone is associated with higher recidivism because of the risk of isolation and lack of support. No job means he might not have stable income, increasing dependency on assistance systems like the criminal justice system, which can lead to more substance abuse or other issues. So this factor contributes to high risk.\n\nHe's never married and doesn't feel depressed recently. Not being depressed could be a positive sign, but since he's single, it's possible he might be seeking help without getting married. However, not feeling depressed isn't a strong indicator on its own; maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is less harmful than other drugs, frequent substance use can lead to more criminal behavior or other complications like debt issues. So this adds to high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might be a positive sign of mental health, but combined with other factors, it's not enough on its own.\n\nChildhood home: He lived with his biological mother in a household of six when young. A large family can sometimes correlate with more supervision or stress, but it could also indicate potential instability if the parents weren't supportive. Since he considers God to be involved in his life, maybe there's some support, but the size is still a point.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior criminal history (high), height/weight (medium), living alone (high), drug use (high). Demographics and recent mental health don't add as much. So overall, he's at high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Demographics (Black)\", \"medium\", \"While being Black is associated with higher recidivism rates, there is no specific data provided to confirm this for this individual.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone places an individual at increased risk of isolation and dependency on the criminal justice system which can lead to more substance abuse or other issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years may contribute to higher rates of substance abuse, which is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Recent (No Depression)\", \"low\", \"Failure to report depression over the past month does not necessarily indicate low risk but combined with other factors such as drug use and living situation, it contributes moderately.\"),\n    (\"Childhood Home Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of six at a young age may have had varying effects on mental health and support, though the individual considers God to be involved which could provide some protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
