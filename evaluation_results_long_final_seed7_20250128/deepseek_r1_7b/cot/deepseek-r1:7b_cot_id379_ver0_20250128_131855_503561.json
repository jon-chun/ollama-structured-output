    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old male rearrest based on his background. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction. That seems significant because past convictions are usually strong indicators of future behavior. So that's high risk right there.\n\nHis race is White, but I don't think that directly affects the recidivism rate unless there's some systemic bias, which might not be applicable here since he's young.\n\nHe's 5'6\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Weight isn't a direct factor in risk assessment, so maybe this is just background info without much impact.\n\nLiving alone can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates because of isolation, but I'm not sure how strong that link is. Maybe medium risk from that perspective.\n\nNever married and living alone: Similar to the above. The social support aspect might be lower since he's alone, which could increase risk. So maybe medium here too.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college: Education level can influence job opportunities and financial stability. Without a higher education, he might have fewer resources to avoid criminal behavior. That would point towards high risk.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment history is important because having stable jobs can lead to better life choices. One job isn't great, so that's medium risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential for further substance misuse, which could affect his ability to reintegrate into society and commit crimes. High risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month: Lack of mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher self-control or lower risk factors, but if he's never been diagnosed with depression, maybe that's a mitigating factor. But since it's recent, perhaps medium.\n\nChildhood living conditions were in a household of six at a young age in a rural area. That was quite challenging for him as a child. It could indicate poor living conditions or neglect, which might affect his behavior and decision-making later on. High risk from this factor.\n\nBelieves in God: This is more of a personal belief, so it's probably less relevant to risk assessment unless there are cultural factors at play, but I don't think that's considered here.\n\nPutting all these together, each factor contributes differently. The conviction stands out as high risk. Employment and living situation contribute medium. Drug use and past living conditions also add to the high risk. Education level is another point towards high risk because having less education can limit opportunities for positive change. So when considering all of them, it seems like he's in a higher risk category.\n\nI think with these factors, especially the previous arrest, lack of job, and drug use, his 3-year rearrest recidivism prediction would lean towards high risk.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor:\n\n- **Conviction**: High risk (High)\n- **Employment**: Medium risk (Medium)\n- **Drug Use**: High risk (High)\n- **Living Situation**: Medium risk (Medium)\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall prediction for 3-year rearrest recidivism is high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Conviction\", \"high\", \"His one prior arrest and conviction significantly increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year may limit opportunities for positive change and contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years can indicate potential substance misuse, which may affect his ability to avoid criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with limited support may increase social isolation, potentially leading to higher recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
