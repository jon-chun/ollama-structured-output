    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young. Young adults often have lower recidivism rates because they're still developing, but there's also a risk as they transition into adulthood. His race is White, which in some contexts might correlate with lower recidivism, but it's not the only factor.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and one conviction. A single offense can increase future risk, especially if it was for a serious crime or left a criminal record that could impede his opportunities later. But since he's never married and living alone, maybe he's in a stable environment now.\n\nHis education level: no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is often linked to lower recidivism because it can provide skills and opportunities. However, if he didn't complete high school for disciplinary reasons, that might indicate other issues.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having some work experience is generally positive as it shows responsibility and ability to support himself. But since he's never married, maybe he relies on others for support.\n\nNo recent drug use in the past four years, which is a good sign. Drug abuse is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates because of the long-term consequences like addiction and family dysfunction.\n\nHe felt down recently but nothing could cheer him up. This might indicate low self-esteem or lack of support systems. It's concerning as it can lead to poor decision-making or increased risk-taking behavior.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area suggests he was raised by his birth parents, which is positive for family stability. However, urban environments can have higher stress levels and socioeconomic factors that might affect him negatively later on.\n\nConsidering his young age, he's likely still developing. His focus on God as a factor in his personal events shows a strong moral compass, which could be beneficial but also indicates possible isolation if there are other issues.\n\nPutting it all together: education and employment history seem positive, but prior arrest, lack of support systems due to living alone, urban environment, and negative emotional state might increase the risk. The presence of a criminal record suggests he might revert or face similar situations again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction, which can indicate past behavior that may influence future actions.
