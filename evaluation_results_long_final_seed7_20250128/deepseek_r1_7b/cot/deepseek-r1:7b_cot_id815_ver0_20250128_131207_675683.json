    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 21-year-old female. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger adults might have more time to develop skills or make different choices, but they're also still impressionable and may be more prone to substance abuse which can increase recidivism.\n\nShe's White. I don't think race is a significant factor in recidivism risk assessment models anymore due to advancements in diversity and inclusion, but it might still have some residual impact if the dataset isn't fully representative.\n\nHer previous offense: She has one arrest and one conviction. A single offense increases the risk compared to someone with no prior convictions, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHeight is 5'5\" and weight between 150-174 lbs. That's within a healthy range, so no indication of substance abuse here since she admitted to marijuana use in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Her recent behavior doesn't show signs of mental health issues which could be linked to substance use.\n\nShe's living alone with no children and has never been married. Living arrangements can affect support systems; being an only child might have different implications, but since she's 21, it's probably more about independence than family dynamics.\n\nHigh school diploma not enrolled in college shows some education, which is generally protective against recidivism. Education tends to correlate with lower recidivism rates as it offers opportunities and better job prospects.\n\nShe has held three jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs can provide financial stability, reduce dependency on drugs for survival, and improve self-sufficiency, so this might be a mitigating factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana specifically) is concerning because substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates. It's a medium risk factor here since she hasn't felt depressed recently, but the history could still predict future substance use which may lead to further issues.\n\nHer past living situation with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area suggests she might have experienced family stress or neglect at some point. This could contribute to behavioral issues and is another medium risk factor.\n\nHer spiritual belief that God plays a role in her life adds a positive influence, potentially reducing recidivism risk compared to someone without such support.\n\nPutting it all together: She has one prior offense (medium), no significant family issues but past living with her mother (medium), no married status affecting her (low), education protecting her (low), job history mitigating (low), drug use in past four years (medium), and spiritual support (low). \n\nConsidering all factors, the overall risk is low. However, the presence of a prior offense and some social factors like living alone might temper it to medium confidence.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully evaluating each factor related to the individual's recidivism risk, here is the analysis:\n\n- **Risk Factor: Prior Arrest/Conviction**  \n  Medium - The individual has one prior arrest and conviction, which increases her risk slightly.\n\n- **Living Situation**  \n  Low - Living alone with no children or spouse reduces potential family support that could influence behavior.\n\n- **Drug Use History**  \n  Medium - Past use of marijuana is concerning but recent lack of depression may mitigate this factor.\n\n- **Education Level**  \n  Low - High school diploma without college enrollment is generally protective, reducing risk.\n\n- **Employment History**  \n  Low - Three job holds provide stability and reduce dependency on substance abuse for survival.\n\n- **Family History**  \n  Medium - Past living with a biological mother in a rural household may indicate potential family stressors.\n\n- **Spiritual Belief**  \n  Low - Positive influence from spirituality reduces recidivism risk, indicating lower likelihood of relapse.\n\nOverall, the risk is categorized as **Medium**, reflecting a moderate chance of rearrest based on the evaluated factors. The confidence level for this prediction is set at **65%** due to the balance of mitigating and enhancing factors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest/Conviction\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction which increases her risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no children or spouse reduces potential family support that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana is concerning but recent lack of depression may mitigate this factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment is generally protective, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Three job holds provide stability and reduce dependency on substance abuse for survival.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Past living with a biological mother in a rural household may indicate potential family stressors.\"),\n    (\"Spiritual Belief\", \"low\", \"Positive influence from spirituality reduces recidivism risk, indicating lower likelihood of relapse.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
