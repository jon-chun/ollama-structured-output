    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of a 21-year-old male with various factors contributing to his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history but it's not a conviction\u2014just an arrest. That might be a red flag because even though it's not a conviction, it could indicate some underlying issues that led to the arrest. So I'm thinking medium risk here.\n\nHe's over 250 lbs and 6 feet 5 inches tall. That makes him morbidly obese, which is a serious health issue. Being overweight can lead to health problems like diabetes or heart disease, which can increase his risk of other crimes or even death. So that should be high risk.\n\nHe's single and living alone. Living alone increases the chances of substance abuse because he might not have support around him to help with things like marijuana use. Also, living alone makes it harder for someone to intervene if issues arise, so that's another medium factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Without further education, he might lack opportunities and could be more susceptible to engaging in risky behaviors or drugs. That seems medium risk as well.\n\nHe's worked two jobs in the past year. Having some work experience is positive because it can provide stability and reduce the incentive to engage in illegal activities. So that lowers the risk a bit\u2014maybe low.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially substance abuse, is a big red flag for recidivism. It can lead to impulsive behaviors or getting involved in illegal activities again. High risk here.\n\nHe was raised in a household of seven at a young age in an urban area by both biological parents. That's a concerning factor because living in such a large household with multiple siblings might have led to neglect, abuse, or other family issues that could contribute to his criminal behavior. High risk due to the environment and family dynamics.\n\nHe believes in God but doesn't feel depressed recently. While his religious belief is positive, it doesn't directly relate to substance use or criminal behavior. So maybe no direct impact here\u2014low risk.\n\nPutting this all together: Medium, high, medium, low, high, low, high. Most of these factors point towards a higher risk. The high weight and family environment are significant contributors. The two jobs might help mitigate some risk, but the other factors like past drug use and lack of education weigh heavily. Therefore, I'd predict a high risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_arrest\", \"medium\", \"An arrest, even without a conviction, can indicate underlying issues that may lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"obesity\", \"high\", \"Morbid obesity is a serious health issue that can increase the risk of other crimes and health complications.\"),\n    (\"single_and_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases the likelihood of substance abuse and lack of support, contributing to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Attending high school but not college may limit opportunities and reduce stability, potentially leading to further involvement in risky activities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having two jobs can provide stability and reduce the incentive for illegal activities, mitigating recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_four_years\", \"high\", \"Drug use history, especially marijuana, is a significant predictor of future substance abuse and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"high\", \"Living in a large household with multiple siblings in an urban area may have contributed to neglect or family dysfunction, increasing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
