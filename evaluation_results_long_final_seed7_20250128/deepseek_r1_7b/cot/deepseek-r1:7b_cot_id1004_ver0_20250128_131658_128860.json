    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for an 18-year-old female. I need to go through each factor one by one and assign a weight based on their impact on recidivism.\n\nFirst off, her age is 18, which might be a positive sign because she's still developing. But considering she has some past drug use, that could be a negative. She's not convicted yet but has an arrest; however, since it's not a conviction, maybe the risk isn't as high there.\n\nShe's White, and while race can influence recidivism rates, without more specific data on her community or prior incidents, I'll default to neutral here. Her height and weight are standard, so no issues there.\n\n living alone might be a red flag because of potential isolation leading to substance use. She's in school, which is good; education often correlates with lower recidivism. Unemployment could be a risk factor since job instability can lead to stress or substance abuse.\n\nShe's never been married and currently single, which seems stable. Drug use history over four years shows some relapse but not a clean record. Her feelings of low mood might contribute to drug use; maybe she's struggling with mental health issues that could affect her choices.\n\nLiving with both parents in a household of four in an urban area might mean she's surrounded by support, which is positive. However, since it was a young age, she might have experienced abuse or neglect, which isn't directly mentioned here but could be inferred and is risky.\n\nHer belief in God suggests she has some level of moral guidance, which can reduce substance use risk compared to those without such beliefs.\n\nConsidering all these factors, her drug use history, living situation, mood swings, and past family environment are the main concerns. I'll weigh these as medium because while there's a risk, other positive factors like education and stable living might mitigate it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age of 18 may suggest she is still developing, but her drug use history could impact her risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and felt down recently, which indicates potential substance abuse issues that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase isolation risks but also offers some independence which could be protective depending on other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"She is currently enrolled in school, which is a positive sign as education can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mood Swings and Feelings of Downness\", \"medium\", \"Her recent feelings of low mood may indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to substance use or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Family History (Household Size)\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in a household of four suggests she has some support, which can be protective but does not directly correlate with recidivism without evidence of abuse or neglect.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 126 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 2 jobs during the year.
