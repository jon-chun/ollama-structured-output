    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there's some systemic bias, but since it's not specified, I'll consider it neutral or maybe low impact.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. That could be a red flag because even if the charge wasn't resolved, it still shows he has criminal history. Maybe medium risk?\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism unless there's some underlying health issue, which isn't indicated here. So probably low impact.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, but not a major factor on its own. Maybe low.\n\nHigh school diploma and in college could mean better educational opportunities or less involvement in the criminal system. That might be a mitigating factor\u2014maybe medium risk reduction.\n\nHe held 3 jobs during the year. Job stability is generally positive for reducing recidivism, so probably not a high risk factor but maybe medium if there were job instability issues.\n\nDrug use from the past four years (marijuana). drug use can have both negative and positive effects on employment or relationships, but since he's not currently using, it might be low. However, prior use could indicate potential relapse\u2014maybe medium.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's a good sign as mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism if untreated, so maybe mitigating\u2014low to medium.\n\nYoung age and living with both parents at a household of six in an urban area. Urban environments might have different dynamics but not necessarily higher risk unless there were family dysfunction or exposure to negative influences. Urban settings could mean better opportunities but also potential stressors. The fact that he considers God involved might indicate some stability, so maybe low impact.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, I think the overall risk is medium because of the arrest and drug use history, which are significant, but other mitigating factors like education and living situation balance it out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Not a direct factor unless systemic bias is involved, which isn't specified here.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"One non-convicted arrest could indicate potential for re-offending despite no prior conviction.\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly relevant to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone doesn't inherently increase risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment might indicate better opportunities but could also suggest less involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Three jobs during the year suggests stability, which is generally positive for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past four years of marijuana use could indicate potential relapse or increased risk despite current non-use.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month might suggest better mental health and lower risk factors related to mental illness.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in a household of six suggests a stable environment, mitigating potential high-risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
