    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Young adults are generally less likely to reoffend compared to older individuals, but still, there's a chance they might relapse into criminal activity if circumstances change.\n\nHe identifies as White. Racial factors can play a role in recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased judiciary practices. However, without specific data on his community or any prior racial discrimination incidents, it's hard to assign a high weight here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Re-arrest is more likely with a criminal history; each previous offense increases the chances of engaging in criminal activities again.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 160 lbs. While physical characteristics can influence self-image and stress, this isn't directly tied to recidivism unless there's a history of substance abuse related to weight or health issues, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't inherently increase risk, but it might limit support networks which could aid in re-arrest prevention efforts.\n\nHigh school diploma with no college enrollment suggests he has the educational background to find stable employment and avoid criminal activities. However, sometimes individuals with a GED may struggle with job placement or substance use issues.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Job instability can lead to financial stress, which might be linked to substance abuse or other risky behaviors contributing to recidivism.\n\nUsing drugs in the past four years is a significant risk factor. Drug use disrupts daily life, reduces self-control, and can lead to criminal behavior if it interferes with job, family, or financial stability.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, but past depressions could be linked to substance abuse issues, which he has a history of.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with both parents in a household of three in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment might have influenced his behavior and decision-making processes without necessarily being directly related to criminal activity.\n\nConsidering that he believes God is involved in his life, this could indicate a strong moral compass or belief system that might deter him from engaging in criminal activities. However, personal beliefs don't always correlate with criminal behavior; some may use religion as an excuse for bad actions.\n\nPutting it all together: He has multiple risk factors like prior convictions, drug use, and living alone. While his age is on the younger side, he does have a history of substance abuse which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending. The lack of a strong support network might not fully mitigate this risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of criminal behavior with two prior arrests and one conviction, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse in the past four years is a significant risk factor as it disrupts daily life and can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may limit support networks that could aid in preventing re-arrest, though this alone does not guarantee recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma with no college enrollment suggests he has the education to find stable employment, which could aid in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year may provide some stability, though job instability can contribute to stress and risky behaviors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
