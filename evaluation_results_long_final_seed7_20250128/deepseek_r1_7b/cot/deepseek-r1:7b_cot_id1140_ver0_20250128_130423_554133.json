    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this risk assessment for an 18-year-old Hispanic male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested three times but not convicted. That's a red flag because even though it's non-convicted, it shows inconsistent behavior and possible attempt to hide behind criminal charges. So that might be high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here. Maybe they're just part of the profile.\n\nHe's living alone, which is fine on its own, but I'm not sure how that affects risk. Maybe if he's unstable socially, but since he's in school, perhaps it's okay.\n\nNot being married doesn't directly relate to recidivism, so maybe low risk here.\n\nEnrolled in school: Education can help reduce recidivism because it provides a structured environment and can lead to better job prospects later. So that might be medium risk.\n\nNo job history is good because lack of employment can reduce the motivation to commit new crimes. Medium again.\n\nNot using drugs for four years, which is positive as substance use often correlates with higher crime rates. But since he's not convicted yet, maybe it's low but not super high.\n\nHe felt down recently and couldn't find cheer. That could indicate some mental health issues or low self-esteem, which are risk factors. So medium here.\n\nLiving in a household of seven at a young age with both parents: That must have been stressful. High risk because it can lead to emotional neglect, dependency, etc., increasing the chance of criminal behavior later on.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, so he might not have the same support system as others who rely on religion for guidance. High risk here too.\n\nPutting this all together, most factors point towards high risk except maybe education and substance use. But since he's got three prior arrests without convictions, it's more than just a red flag\u2014it shows inconsistency. The living situation with seven family members is really concerning and could lead to dependency issues or neglect, which are strong indicators.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the overall risk of rearrest in three years is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without Conviction\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested multiple times but not convicted suggests inconsistent behavior and possible attempt to evade legal consequences, indicating a higher likelihood of future involvement in the criminal system.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase risk unless combined with other factors like unemployment or lack of support networks.
