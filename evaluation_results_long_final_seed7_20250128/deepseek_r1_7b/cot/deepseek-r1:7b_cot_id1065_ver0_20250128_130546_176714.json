    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 20-year-old female who's potentially at risk of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has two arrests but no convictions. That might mean her criminal history isn't too bad, but since it's two minor offenses, maybe the weight here is low because the number is small and they're not severe.\n\nShe's 5'1\" and weighs 130 lbs. Weight doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there are other factors like substance abuse or health issues, which aren't mentioned here. So probably a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone isn't great, but again, it depends on her support system. Since she's single and hasn't married, maybe there's less social backing, so perhaps that adds some medium weight.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college\u2014many people with this background end up in similar situations, so this might be a low risk factor since she has the education to make better choices.\n\nNo job during the year. Joblessness can lead to higher recidivism because it might take time to find stable employment or access services. That's probably medium weight because it's significant but not the most critical factor on its own.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator of substance abuse problems, which can contribute to legal issues and instability. This should be high risk since substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month. Lack of emotional support or mental health issues can affect her ability to reintegrate successfully after any potential incarceration. However, she considers God as part of her faith, which might provide some support, so maybe this is medium weight because she's aware of her mental health but hasn't mentioned it as a problem.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with her biological mother. A larger family can sometimes mean less parental attention or different living conditions that might impact her behavior. This could be low to medium risk depending on the dynamics, but since she's an adult now, maybe there's some residual impact\u2014so perhaps medium weight because it's not directly related to recidivism unless there were issues.\n\nHer religious beliefs are present, which can offer support and structure. This is positive and might reduce risk factors, so low weight here.\n\nPutting all these together: two minor arrests (low), living alone (medium), high school diploma (low), no job (medium), recent drug use (high), lack of depression (medium), family background (medium). The highest risk factor is the recent drug use. \n\nThe prediction would be that she has a higher chance of rearrest, so I'd lean towards \"YES\" with medium to high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of minor arrests\", \"low\", \"Her two minor arrests indicate a clean criminal history, which is generally positive for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase isolation and stress, potentially increasing risk factors despite no immediate issues.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment suggests she has the capacity to make better life choices.\"),\n    (\"Job status\", \"medium\", \"Not working during the year could lead to financial instability or difficulty finding support services.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of cocaine use is a significant indicator of ongoing substance abuse, which correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"medium\", \"Lack of recent depression might suggest she's mentally stable, but her religious beliefs provide some structure and support.\"),\n    (\"Family background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of four doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless there were underlying issues.\"\n)\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
