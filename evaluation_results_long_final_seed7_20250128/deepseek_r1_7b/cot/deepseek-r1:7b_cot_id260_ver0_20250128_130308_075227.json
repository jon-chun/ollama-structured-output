    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has one arrest but no conviction. That might be a low to medium risk because not being convicted could mean less immediate supervision or harsher penalties. But since it's only one arrest, maybe the risk isn't too high yet.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they're just physical attributes without any indication of health issues or behavior tied to them.\n\nHe's living alone with no children in a household of three in an urban area. Living with his mother when young could provide stability, so maybe low risk. But since he's now living alone, that might indicate some change in circumstances or potential stressors.\n\nNot being married and living alone again\u2014maybe indicates a lack of support network, which could be a medium risk factor because losing a parent at a young age might have emotional impacts affecting his behavior.\n\nHe has one job during the year. One job isn't bad; it shows he's employed, but maybe not enough to consistently help with managing any issues he's facing.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, and recently felt really down for an extended period. This could be a significant risk factor because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior or self-harm. The recent feelings of depression might indicate an underlying mental health issue that could lead to more risky behavior.\n\nReligious involvement\u2014he believes God plays a role in his life. That can sometimes be protective, but if he's feeling down, maybe it's due to external pressures rather than personal issues.\n\nNow, putting it all together: The arrest is low risk because no conviction and one offense. Not married living alone might be medium or low depending on circumstances. Drug use with recent feelings of depression points towards higher risk factors like substance abuse leading to more impulsive behavior. The religious belief could mitigate some but not eliminate the risk.\n\nSo, overall, considering all these factors, his risk is probably medium. But since he's young and has a potential support network (mother), maybe leaning towards low? However, recent mental health issues due to drug use might tip it up.\n</think>\n\nAfter carefully evaluating each factor related to the individual's background and circumstances, here's the structured analysis:\n\n- **Arrest History**: Low risk. The presence of one arrest without a conviction suggests limited immediate supervision or harsher penalties, indicating lower recidivism risk compared to those with convictions.\n\n- **Lifestyle Factors**: Medium risk. Living alone after living with his biological mother might indicate changes in support networks, which could influence behavior but doesn't inherently suggest high risk.\n\n- **Mental Health and Substance Use**: High risk. The recent feelings of depression and substance abuse (marijuana use) are significant concerning mental health and impulsive behaviors that often precede criminal activity.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the overall risk assessment leans towards a medium level due to the combination of living circumstances and recent behavioral indicators pointing toward increased recidivism probability.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"The individual has one arrest without a conviction, which suggests limited immediate supervision or harsher penalties.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after living with his biological mother might indicate changes in support networks, influencing behavior but not necessarily high risk on its own.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health and Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of depression and substance abuse (marijuana use) are significant concerning mental health and impulsive behaviors that often precede criminal activity.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
