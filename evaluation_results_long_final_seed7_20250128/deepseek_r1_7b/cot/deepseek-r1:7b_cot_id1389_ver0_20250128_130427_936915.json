    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old Hispanic male. He's been arrested seven times and convicted, which is a strong indicator of past criminal behavior. His lack of education\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014and not attending college could mean he doesn't have the necessary skills for stable employment, which might contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe lives alone, so maybe he doesn't have support from family or friends who could help him get back on track. Not using drugs in the past four years is positive, but his recent lack of depression over a month isn't clear\u2014could be temporary stress or other factors.\n\nHis background living with his biological mother in a household of four might indicate family issues that could affect his current stability. His religious beliefs are mentioned, which could offer support and motivation towards positive behavior.\n\nPutting all these together, the high number of prior convictions is probably the biggest risk factor here. Education level, living alone, and not using drugs are also contributing but maybe to a medium degree. The family history might somewhat reduce the risk, but his lack of education and unstable living situation could increase it. So overall, I'd lean towards high risk with some mitigating factors reducing it to medium.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of various risk factors, the individual's likelihood of rearrest is considered to be medium.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 7 prior convictions, indicating significant criminal behavior and potential for continued misconduct.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may impede employment opportunities and contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Not being enrolled in college and holding only one job suggests limited opportunities for growth and stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use in the past four years indicates a possible reduction in substance abuse which could influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living alone with a household size of 4 may suggest some level of independence, though family dynamics can still impact behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month but living in a potentially stressful environment might affect mental health indirectly.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Considering God has something to do with personal life could provide support and motivation towards positive behavior, reducing risk.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
