Her education level might help her now but could indicate she's had opportunities to change.\n\nShe lives alone, which can be isolating and might contribute to substance use. Using drugs in the past four years adds to her history of substance abuse, which is concerning. Her low job stability suggests she might not have strong support or resources.\n\nThe factors point towards a higher risk of relapse and future involvement. So, considering all these points, I lean towards high risk with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convictions\", \"high\", \"Having been convicted twice is a significant factor as prior convictions increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior or reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drugs use\", \"medium\", \"Using drugs in the past four years could indicate a potential relapse, which would increase the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"low job stability\", \"high\", \"Holding only 5 jobs over the year suggests inconsistent income and support system, potentially leading to increased substance use or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"past household size\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of size 3 at a young age may have had a positive influence but could also indicate limited family support which might contribute to current behavior patterns.\"),\n    (\"religion belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God does not directly correlate with recidivism risk, and the lack of mention here suggests it is not a significant factor in this context.\"),\n    (\"age at first offense\", \"low\", \"Being 22 years old indicates she is still relatively young, which might suggest fewer life experiences that could contribute to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"substance use history\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years may indicate a potential for continued or increased substance use, which can be linked to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
