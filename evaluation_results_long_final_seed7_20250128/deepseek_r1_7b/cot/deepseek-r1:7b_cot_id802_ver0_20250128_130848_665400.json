    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I've got a query here where the user is asking me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They want me to assign a relative weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014to each of several risk factors provided by a 19-year-old male. Then, based on these factors, predict his rearrest recidivism over three years and provide confidence levels.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the information given about this individual. Let's list out the key points:\n\n- Age: 19, male, White.\n- Arrests: 1 time, not convicted.\n- Demographics: 5'8\", 155 lbs, living alone, never married.\n- Education: High school diploma, not in college.\n- Employment: Worked 2 jobs in the past year.\n- Drug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years; felt down recently.\n- Family history: lived with both parents at age of 7 in a household of five in an urban area.\n- Beliefs: doesn't believe in God.\n\nNow, I need to consider each of these factors in the context of recidivism risk. Recidivism risk assessment typically looks at factors like prior criminal history, demographics, substance use, employment status, family background, etc.\n\nStarting with age\u201419 is still quite young, but since he's not convicted yet, maybe a low impact? But his recent drug use could be significant.\n\nRace as White might have some considerations, but without specific data on how that affects him compared to others, it might be medium. However, without explicit info, I'm cautious here.\n\nArrests: Only one, not a conviction\u2014maybe low weight since one offense isn't severe yet.\n\nHeight and weight: Doesn't seem directly related unless in a high-risk job, but no info given, so probably low.\n\nLiving alone: Living situation can affect mental health or substance use, which could be medium. But no direct link here without more context.\n\nMarital status: Never married\u2014maybe some factors, but again, no info on how it affects his behavior directly.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college: Education level is often linked to lower recidivism because of higher chances for further education, so maybe low.\n\nEmployment: Worked two jobs. Employment generally reduces recidivism risk because having a stable job can provide motivation and reduce time spent on streets or criminal activities\u2014so medium impact but positive.\n\nDrug use: Past four years with marijuana and cocaine\u2014substance abuse is a strong indicator of higher risk. The recent feeling of low mood might be tied to drug use, which could worsen mental health issues leading to more crime\u2014high weight here.\n\nFamily history: Lived with both parents at age 7 in a large household\u2014could indicate a more chaotic environment or lack of supervision, which is often a risk factor for recidivism. Also, living alone later might increase the risk as an indicator of family dysfunction\u2014so medium to high.\n\nBeliefs not tied to personal outcomes\u2014doesn't seem directly related but could affect motivation; however, without info on mental health issues, maybe low weight.\n\nNow, putting it all together: The most significant factors are drug use and family background. Drug use seems like a top risk factor here because recent use can be an indicator of ongoing substance abuse which is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates. Family background could also contribute due to potential lack of supervision or support systems.\n\nConsidering all this, the prediction would lean towards high risk but not certain. With high confidence\u2014maybe around 80% as there are clear indicators that point towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which may indicate a lower probability of severe recidivism compared to older individuals.
