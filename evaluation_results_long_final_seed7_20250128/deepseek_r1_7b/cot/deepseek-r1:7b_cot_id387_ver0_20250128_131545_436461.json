    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to rearrest within three years. Let's break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male with five prior arrests and convictions. That seems like a lot of negative history. Each arrest increases his chances of getting into trouble again, so that's definitely high risk.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches and he weighs 165 lbs. I don't know if that matters here since it's just describing him, but maybe weight could be relevant for something else like substance use? He has no high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That's a big red flag because education is often linked to lower recidivism rates when he's out of school.\n\nHe worked two jobs last year. Having some income can help with stability, but two jobs might not be enough for someone his age without support. Maybe that's medium risk?\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other substances. But even occasional drug use can affect his judgment and behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with people might provide support, but if he's still experiencing instability, that could be a risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of four in a rural area. That might have contributed to some stress or family issues without enough supervision. Plus, his lack of belief in God could lead him down certain paths, which is another high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: His criminal history (five arrests) alone should make the prediction high. His education and job situation don't seem to help much. The drug use might add a bit more risk but not as significant as the arrest count. His living environment could be contributing factors.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has multiple high-risk factors, including a significant criminal history, lack of education, unstable living situation, and potential substance use issues. These factors collectively contribute to a high likelihood of rearrest.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested five times and convicted, which significantly increases the risk of reoffending within three years.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which can lead to instability and higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years; while this might contribute to risk, it is less significant than other factors like prior arrests and education level.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Not living alone and never being married could lead to instability, which may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior or seeking retribution.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
