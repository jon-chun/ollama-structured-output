    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old male. He's White, hasn't been married, living alone, has a high school diploma but isn't in college. He's worked five jobs in a year, which is a lot of experience. His drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine from the past four years, and he's been feeling really down lately.\n\nHe was arrested once and convicted, which immediately raises some red flags because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher recidivism rates. His age being 19 also might be a factor; sometimes younger individuals can have different motivations or circumstances that could affect their behavior.\n\nHis living situation alone at such a young age is concerning. Maybe he's dealing with stress without support, which could lead to more impulsive decisions. His recent drug use, especially in the past month when he felt really down, might indicate substance abuse issues, which are known predictors of recidivism.\n\nConsidering his family background\u2014living with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014he might have experiences that contribute to his behavior. He believes in God, so perhaps he's dealing with personal or relational issues but doesn't necessarily translate directly into criminal tendencies.\n\nHis educational level and job experience could indicate responsibility, which is usually a lower risk factor. However, the drug use and emotional state are more concerning. Combining all these factors, I think his risk is on the higher side because of prior arrest, substance abuse, and recent negative emotions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"Prior conviction history increases recidivism risk as individuals with a past are more likely to engage in similar behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana and cocaine, is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates due to potential impulsive behaviors and legal consequences.\"),\n    (\"recent emotional state\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying issues that may contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors but don't directly translate to criminal liability.\"),\n    (\"age and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Youth without support can present challenges, though the age being 19 is not necessarily a direct indicator.Living alone might exacerbate stress but doesn't always correlate with higher recidivism unless combined with other factors.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban area with family does not inherently suggest risk unless it's associated with higher stress or neglect, which isn't indicated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
