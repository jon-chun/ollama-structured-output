Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested twice and convicted. That's a clear sign of past criminal behavior, which is high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here; they probably aren't factors in recidivism.\n\nHe's never married and living with someone else\u2014maybe living situation could matter, but since he has no history of family issues, it might not add much. I'll rate this as low.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he didn't finish education, which is a risk factor because less education can lead to more substance abuse and criminal behavior. That's medium.\n\nHe held two jobs last year\u2014some stability but maybe not enough support system, so maybe medium impact.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana only) might indicate potential for substance abuse issues. That could be high risk.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his mother and family size of five suggests growing up in a challenging environment. That's definitely high risk.\n\nConsidering God as something that affects him\u2014religion can sometimes predict behavior, so maybe medium to low depending on how it influences. I'll go with medium.\n\nPutting all together: two prior convictions (high), education (medium), job history (medium), substance use (high), family background (high). The factors point towards high risk overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of two prior arrests and convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED may contribute to substance abuse issues and reduced life skills, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year may indicate some level of stability but could also suggest insufficient support network contributing to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years could signal potential substance abuse issues, which are often linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area at a young age suggests exposure to a potentially high-risk environment that may influence criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Considering God as something that affects personal decisions could indicate internalized religion, which while not directly tied to crime, might be a mitigating factor depending on the individual's interpretation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
