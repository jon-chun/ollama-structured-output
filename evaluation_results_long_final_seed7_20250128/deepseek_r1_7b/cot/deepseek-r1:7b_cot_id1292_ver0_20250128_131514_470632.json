    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old Black male rearresting within three years. He has a couple of past convictions, which is already a red flag because prior criminal history increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe's currently not living alone and is divorced, but I don't know how stable that environment is. Maybe he's facing some personal challenges there, but it's hard to say without more info.\n\nHis lack of education\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014and not attending college might mean he has limited opportunities, making him more prone to engaging in risky behaviors again.\n\nHe only held one job last year; that doesn't sound stable. Unemployment can lead people into other criminal activities as a means of survival or escape from difficult situations.\n\nNot using drugs for four years is positive, but sometimes substance abuse isn't always reported honestly, so I'm cautious there.\n\nHe's not depressed in the past month, which might be because he's been through something else. However, if his depression was long-term before, it could have contributed to his current issues.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with his biological mother in an urban area\u2014maybe he's been exposed to some stressors or family dynamics that might affect him now.\n\nBelieving in God might help with moral decisions, but sometimes religion can also lead to problematic beliefs if they influence his risk-taking behavior.\n\nPutting all this together, the prior convictions are a strong indicator. The lack of education and employment stability also add to the risk. His living situation and family background could be contributing factors. While he's clean now, external stressors from his past might push him towards criminal activity again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the risk of reoffending as recidivism is common among those with criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college can limit opportunities, potentially increasing risky behavior and reoffending rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"low\", \"Only held one job last year which may indicate unstable financial situation leading to substance abuse or other risky behaviors as a coping mechanism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years but could be a false negative if previous drug use was not reported accurately\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"medium\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month, but prior issues might still influence behavior indirectly through stress or family dynamics.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Currently not living alone and divorced with a household size of 4 could indicate unstable living conditions potentially linked to higher risk behaviors or substance abuse as coping mechanisms in an urban environment\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in a household of four, which might have contributed to past stressors that could now influence criminal behavior through decision-making processes or access to resources for reoffending\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes in God but this alone does not directly correlate with higher risk unless it influences risky decision-making which is not evident here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
