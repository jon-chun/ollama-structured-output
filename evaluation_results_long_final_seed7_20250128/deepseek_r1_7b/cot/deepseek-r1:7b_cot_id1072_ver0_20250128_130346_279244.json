    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out the risk assessment for this 20-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest but no conviction. That might not be too bad yet, but it's something to consider. Next, his race is Black, which historically has had some disparities in the criminal justice system, so that could play a role.\n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches, but I don't think height is a significant factor here. His marital status is living alone with no children, which might mean he doesn't have the same level of support or supervision as someone who's married.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED could limit his opportunities and increase substance use, especially since he's been using cocaine in the past four years. That seems like a red flag for relapse.\n\nHe held only one job during the year, which might indicate he's underemployed or struggling to find stable employment, making him more susceptible to other pressures leading to recidivism.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month is interesting. Maybe he's in denial about his situation or actively seeking help. That could be a positive sign.\n\nHis early life involved living with his biological mother in a household of eight in an urban area. That environment might have had its own issues, possibly leading to family dysfunction or exposure to negative influences.\n\nConsidering that he believes in God, which he sees as influencing his personal decisions, this might indicate a sense of moral guidance or at least some level of internal support system.\n\nNow, putting it all together: one arrest, no high school diploma, living alone, substance use (cocaine), and past family environment. These factors seem to increase the risk of recidivism over three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest history\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one prior arrest but has not been convicted, which may indicate a lack of significant criminal history but could still be a contributing factor if re-arrested in the future.\"),\n    (\"Race (Black)\", \"medium\", \"Criminal justice disparities based on race may influence his risk perception and treatment effectiveness compared to non-Basic demographic factors individuals.\"),\n    (\"Marital status (living alone with no children)\", \"low\", \"Living independently may offer some level of self-reliance, but isolation can sometimes lead to increased vulnerability to stressors or triggers.\"),\n    (\"Education level (no high school diploma/GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to limited opportunities for reintegration into society and potential substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Employment status (one job in the past year)\", \"medium\", \"Having one job may suggest some level of employability, but reliance on a single source can make him more vulnerable to loss of income or job instability which could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (cocaine use in past four years)\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly cocaine, is strongly associated with higher rates of relapse and recidivism.
