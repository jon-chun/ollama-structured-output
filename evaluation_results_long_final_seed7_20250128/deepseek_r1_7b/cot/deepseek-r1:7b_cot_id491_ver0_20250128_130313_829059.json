    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 20-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White, but race doesn't usually predict criminal behavior directly. So maybe no impact here.\n\nHe has one arrest but not a conviction. That\u2019s a minor offense, so probably low to medium risk because it's just an arrest.\n\nAge is 20, which is young and often associated with lower recidivism since he's still developing.\n\nHeight is 5'9\", weight 145 lbs; no indication of physical issues or past behavior related to weight.\n\nUnmarried and living alone might mean less support system, but if he's stable otherwise, maybe medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014significantly negative. Low chance of re-entering education, increasing risk.\n\nOnly held one job recently, which is okay; some stability but not strong enough to lower risk much.\n\nDrug use: Never used in past four years \u2013 good sign, so low risk related to substance abuse.\n\nNo recent depression symptoms over the past month\u2014good mental health, so that's a positive.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in a household of 4 in a rural area since youth. That might suggest family support or perhaps less exposure to stressors, which could be protective but maybe some social factors in a rural setting could have issues.\n\nBelieves in God affecting personal decisions\u2014positives like strong moral guidance can lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The education and employment history are major red flags for low probability of reoffending. However, other factors like living situation might slightly mitigate if they're stable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest Record\", \"low\", \"This is a minor offense with no prior conviction.
