    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment for a 22-year-old female. I need to evaluate each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age: 22 is relatively young, which might mean she's still developing coping skills and less likely to have a strong foundation against recidivism. So that's low risk.\n\nShe identifies as White, but I'm not sure how that affects recidivism rates beyond racial statistics, which can vary widely. Not enough info here, so medium.\n\nOne arrest without conviction: An arrest doesn't lead to a conviction, so she hasn't shown criminal tendencies yet. That's a low factor.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'3\" and 260 lbs. These aren't directly linked to recidivism, but maybe could indicate other issues if they're problematic, but no info here, so medium.\n\nNot married and living alone: Living arrangements don't directly correlate with recidivism unless there's domestic abuse or neglect, which isn't mentioned. So medium risk.\n\nGED without college enrollment: Having a GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, reducing recidivism. But not enrolled now could mean she might seek higher education, which is positive. Medium.\n\nOne job in the past year: Employment stability generally reduces recidivism since having income support can help maintain sobriety or financial stability. So low risk.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to cocaine use in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use can be a strong predictor of future substance abuse, which increases recidivism risk. High factor.\n\nMood swings leading to nothing: She feels down often but doesn't do anything about it. This could indicate poor coping mechanisms or low self-esteem, both linked to higher recidivism. High.\n\nYouth living with her mom in a household of three: A small family can provide support, so maybe lower risk compared to larger households. Medium.\n\nBelief in God affecting personal issues: While spirituality can help, it's not directly tied to recidivism unless there are underlying personal issues not mentioned here. So medium.\n\nPutting it all together: The high factors are drug use and mood swings. Other factors like age, living situation, and GED point towards low risk but aren't enough to offset the high ones. So overall, she's at a higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals generally have fewer life experiences that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race can influence outcomes, this information is limited and may not directly correlate with recidivism without additional context.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"One non-convicted arrest suggests no prior criminal behavior but does not predict future recidivism directly.\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"medium\", \"Height and weight are not directly linked to recidivism risk without additional context about potential issues.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not married living alone does not inherently indicate a high risk of recidivism but could be a contributing factor in other areas if neglected.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED can sometimes correlate with better job opportunities, reducing recidivism risk, but not being enrolled might suggest lower support mechanisms.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"One job in the past year suggests some level of stability which is generally protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use and current mood swings indicate potential substance abuse issues, a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Youth Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of three suggests some level of support but does not directly correlate with high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God can be protective if it leads to positive coping mechanisms, but this information alone does not strongly indicate high risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 260 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year.
