    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two convictions. That's a red flag because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's definitely high.\n\nHis age is 22, which might mean he's still developing his skills, but since he has two convictions, I think it leans towards high risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, so that's another medium to high factor because isolation might lead him to turn to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he probably has limited opportunities, which could put him at higher risk of engaging in negative activities. That's definitely a high factor.\n\nHe's worked five jobs in a year. That seems like a good sign because job stability can help with financial stability and reducing stress. But I'm not sure how relevant that is to recidivism; maybe it doesn't directly contribute much, so perhaps medium.\n\nDrug use history: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and sometimes recently. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential for future substance use, which can lead to further crimes or other issues. That's definitely high.\n\nHe felt down often over the past month. Emotional distress might make him more susceptible to substance abuse or making poor decisions. Also, it could affect his relationships and living situation. High risk here too.\n\nFrom a young age, he lived with both parents in a big household of six in an urban area. That's probably a tough environment, maybe leading to instability or neglect, which can contribute to criminal behavior. High factor.\n\nHe believes in God but thinks it affects his personal life. While religious beliefs don't directly cause crime, they might influence his behavior if he turns to religion for guidance when things go wrong, potentially leading to more delinquent acts. Maybe medium here because it's a bit indirect.\n\nPutting this all together: two prior convictions (high), living alone and no support system (medium high), limited education (high), recent drug use (high), emotional distress (high), early family issues (high), and some religious belief (medium). The factors with the highest influence are the prior convictions, drug use, and family environment. \n\nConsidering all these, his risk of rearrest is quite high. I would predict a \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has two previous convictions which significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without support can lead to increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED reduces opportunities and may contribute to substance abuse or other negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine, especially within the past month, increases the risk of further substance abuse or criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Frequent feelings of sadness that can lead to substance use or poor decision-making, potentially contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Early exposure to a large household in an urban area may have caused instability leading to potential criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
