    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 19-year-old male. He's been arrested four times with convictions, which is a significant factor. His age being young might make him more prone to substance abuse issues, which he has experienced both in the past four years and recently.\n\nHe lives alone without a high school diploma or GED, so his educational background could contribute to unstable situations. Employing only four jobs in a year isn't great either; joblessness often correlates with higher recidivism rates. \n\nHis drug use history is concerning\u2014he's used marijuana and cocaine both recreationally and more recently. Substance abuse can really impact someone's ability to function and maintain stable relationships or employment, which could lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nHe was raised in a household of four with his biological dad in an urban area at a young age. That might have influenced his family dynamics or social environment, possibly contributing to his current issues. His belief in God might provide some moral support but doesn't necessarily mitigate negative behaviors related to substance abuse and unstable circumstances.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014multiple arrests, low education, joblessness, drug use, and family background\u2014it's clear he has several risk indicators pointing towards higher recidivism. My analysis leads me to predict a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested four times with prior convictions, indicating a history of criminal behavior which is a significant predictor of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Youth Age and Substance Abuse\", \"high\", \"At the age of 19, he may experience higher levels of substance abuse, which can contribute to further criminal behavior and increased risk of reoffending within three years.\"),\n    (\"Educational and Employment Challenges\", \"medium\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED and has not enrolled in college, potentially leading to economic instability and limited opportunities that might influence his ability to avoid recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Lack of Stable Relationships and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a stable family support system could increase stress and substance abuse issues, both of which are risk factors for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine, along with recent drug use, suggests ongoing or relapsing substance abuse, which is a known factor associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Family History in an Urban Area\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of four in an urban area may have provided him with social and family dynamics that could contribute to his current behavioral challenges, though the urban setting itself doesn't directly indicate increased risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
