    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this 22-year-old male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his past convictions: he has been convicted four times. That\u2019s a significant number; more than most people in the general population. Higher number of previous convictions generally indicate higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 190 lbs. These are average stats for someone his age, so maybe no direct impact on recidivism unless there's something about his weight that contributes to substance use or other issues.\n\nNever married and currently not living alone. While living arrangements can sometimes correlate with support systems, in this case, since he's an adult and seems to be managing, perhaps it doesn't add much risk here.\n\nHigh school diploma but enrolled in a 2-year college. Some educational attainment is good for reducing recidivism, so the fact that he's still studying might lower his risk compared to someone with fewer options.\n\nHe held only one job during the year. Job stability can be linked to reduced recidivism; having some employment suggests he has alternative opportunities if he gets in trouble again.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years, and recently felt down for several days without cheers. Drug use is a strong indicator of substance abuse issues, which are known risk factors for reoffending. Also, recent feelings of low mood could suggest underlying mental health issues that might escalate if not addressed.\n\nYoung age at which he lived with his biological mother in a household of four: Starting at a young age can sometimes be linked to family dysfunction or neglect, which might have long-term effects on behavior and stability.\n\nBelief that God has nothing to do with his personal life: This could indicate existential despair, which is associated with higher recidivism rates as it might lead to decreased motivation for positive actions.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors point towards a high risk of rearrest. Multiple past convictions, drug use, and family background contribute significantly. The educational status doesn't offset these risks enough.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Previous Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of multiple arrests (4) which is associated with higher recidivism risk due to lack of motivation or support to reintegrate into society effectively.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly marijuana, indicates potential substance abuse issues and emotional distress, both strong indicators of increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of 4 from a young age suggests possible family dysfunction or neglect, which can contribute to behavioral issues and higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Concerns\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for several days without cheerful distractions may indicate underlying mental health issues that could exacerbate substance abuse and other behavioral problems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
