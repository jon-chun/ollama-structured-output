Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has one arrest but no conviction. That's not a lot of history, so maybe low weight? But considering it's a misdemeanor, perhaps medium?\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 199 lbs\u2014though his size might be relevant if it affects his ability to commit serious crimes or job performance.\n\nLiving alone could mean less stability, but since he's never married, maybe that's not directly related. Still, living alone can contribute to isolation, so medium weight?\n\nNo high school diploma and no GED: educational barriers often correlate with higher recidivism, especially for non-criminal outcomes. High weight here.\n\nHe's worked three jobs in a year\u2014some work experience is positive, but inconsistent or temporary might not be as strong an indicator. Medium.\n\nDrug use past four years (marijuana only): drug use can lead to substance abuse issues which may affect job performance or relationships. Medium weight.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently: Could indicate good mental health if he's actively working on it. Maybe low weight since no sign of serious mental issues.\n\nYoung age and living with biological mother in a household of five: Early-life factors, like family environment, can influence behavior. High weight because family dynamics are often linked to recidivism risk.\n\nBelieves in God: Religious beliefs might not directly impact criminal behavior but could relate to personal stability. Low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factor is probably the household of five and no education. The low factors are age, lack of religion, and recent depression signs. The medium factors include past arrest, drug use, and job history.\n\nFor prediction: Considering he has a significant risk factor (household size) and moderate others, it's likely to have a high chance of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"past_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one past misdemeanor arrest but no prior conviction.
