    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism risk for this 18-year-old female. She's got a few factors that might influence her chances of being rearrested in the next three years.\n\nFirst off, she has four prior convictions. That seems like a big red flag because more past crimes can mean higher chances of getting into trouble again. I think that factor would be high risk.\n\nShe's 6 feet tall and weighs 220 lbs. Hmm, while her weight is above average for her height, it doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless maybe she's struggling with substance use. But since we don't know if she's currently using drugs, this might not add much. Maybe medium risk because body type alone isn't a strong indicator.\n\nShe's living alone and isn't married. Being in a domestic relationship can sometimes reduce stress and provide support, but since she's single, maybe that's less of a mitigating factor. Still, it's something to note; perhaps low or medium risk here.\n\nHer job situation: she has one job now after holding two jobs previously. Having stable employment might help with financial stability and reducing substance use, so that could be a lower risk factor.\n\nShe used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator of possible substance abuse issues, which can lead to more criminal behavior or other problems. That's definitely high risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, but she has drug use history. Maybe she's struggling with mental health issues related to her addiction, which could affect her ability to reintegrate successfully. So that might also be a medium factor contributing to higher risk.\n\nShe was raised in a household of seven with her biological mother in an urban area. That's quite a large family living together. While having multiple siblings can provide support and stability, it's possible she experienced a lot of neglect or abuse growing up, which could increase recidivism risk. So that would be high.\n\nHer religious belief that God is involved in her life might offer some support, but it depends on how active she is in her faith and whether that influences her behavior. Since she identifies as White, maybe cultural factors play a role, but without more info, I'll consider this low to medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: four convictions (high), living alone (low-medium), no marriage (low-medium), job situation (low), drug use (high), and family background (high). The drug use seems the most significant factor. Considering she's 18, maybe not as far along in her life yet, but having a history of substance abuse can be really dangerous.\n\nSo overall, with four high factors and two medium ones, I'd lean towards a high risk prediction because of the drug use and prior convictions. Her age might mitigate some, but other factors are too strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of four prior convictions which significantly increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and potential stress, which may indirectly contribute to higher risk but is mitigated by current employment and no marriage.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse history, particularly marijuana and cocaine, strongly indicates potential ongoing issues that could impact future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Growing up in a household of seven with biological mother in an urban area may suggest exposure to neglect or abuse, which can be a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Job Situation\", \"low\", \"Having one current job after past employment suggests some level of financial stability and potential for better outcomes compared to those without stable employment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
