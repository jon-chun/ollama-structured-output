    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, she's got a history of seven arrests and four convictions. That's a lot of past involvement with the system. More than ten convictions would typically indicate higher risk, so that's definitely high.\n\nShe's only 19 but has been in trouble multiple times. It shows she might still be developing coping mechanisms or maybe struggling with personal issues that haven't been resolved yet.\n\nHer age is on the younger side, which usually means less life experience and more potential for relapse. Younger people often have different motivations and might not grasp the consequences of their actions as fully.\n\nShe's White, but I don't think race is a significant factor here unless there's some systemic bias, which isn't indicated. So maybe this doesn't affect her risk much.\n\nHeight and weight are given, but those usually aren't factors in risk assessment without medical context or health issues. She weighs 115 lbs at 5'4\", which is average for her age. Not sure how that affects risk here.\n\n living with someone alone\u2014she's never been married and is living alone. Living arrangement can affect support systems, but since she's an only child (since she was raised by her mother in a household of four as a young person), maybe less support now. But being alone doesn't necessarily mean she'll have the same level of support later.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't college-bound. Some people find that not pursuing higher education might correlate with substance use or other risky behaviors, but it's not a direct indicator without more info on her current activities.\n\nShe held four jobs in the past year. Job experience can sometimes indicate responsibility or life skills, but if she has substance abuse issues, having multiple jobs might be temporary and not sustainable long-term.\n\nDrug use history\u2014marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. That's concerning because drug use is linked to impulsive behavior, lack of responsibility, and higher likelihood of criminal activity like theft or violence.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in a month. While depression can sometimes lead to substance abuse, not feeling it now doesn't necessarily mean she won't develop it later. Plus, without more info on her mental health history, this factor is neutral.\n\nHer young age at first arrest suggests she may have been influenced by family dynamics or external factors early on, which could indicate a need for intervention but might also show potential for change if addressed properly.\n\nConsidering God's influence on her life\u2014religion can provide moral guidance and support, so that's probably protective rather than risk-enhancing.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, drug use, living alone at a young age. These factors point towards high risk of rearrest because of past behavior patterns, lack of stable environment, and substance issues which can lead to more impulsive or criminal decisions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Multiple Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Her seven arrests and four convictions indicate a history of involvement in the judicial system, which can predict future behavior patterns leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living alone from a young age might affect her social support network, potentially influencing future decisions and behaviors that could lead to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse history, particularly marijuana and cocaine, is strongly linked to impulsive behavior and increased risk of engaging in criminal activities which can result in rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Young Age at Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Arresting at a relatively young age (19) may suggest underlying issues such as impulsivity or family dynamics that could contribute to future criminal behavior if not addressed adequately.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
