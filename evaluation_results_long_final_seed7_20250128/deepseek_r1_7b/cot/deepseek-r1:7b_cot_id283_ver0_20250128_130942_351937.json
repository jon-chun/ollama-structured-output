    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this risk assessment for an 18-year-old Black male. He has a history of two arrests and a conviction, which is a significant factor in recidivism. His weight and height don't typically play into recidivism unless there's an issue with health, but here it seems more about behavior.\n\nHe's living alone without a family structure, which can contribute to higher risk because he might not have support during tough times. He has a high school diploma and is in college, which usually indicates some level of stability or motivation, but his recent drug use could be a red flag.\n\nUsing drugs both in the past four years and especially in the last month seems concerning. That recent heavy use can really impact someone's mental health and decision-making abilities, increasing the chance he might engage in criminal behavior again.\n\nHis past living situation, especially foster or adoption, along with his current beliefs in God, suggests a possible higher risk due to emotional instability or lack of support system. This could affect his ability to stay on track after release.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, each contributes moderately towards the risk of rearrest. Combining them gives a moderate relative weight for the overall prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of two arrests and a conviction, which indicates prior involvement in the criminal system and may suggest higher likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, particularly in the past four years and especially in the last month, can impair judgment and mental stability, increasing the risk of recidivism.

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 270 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
