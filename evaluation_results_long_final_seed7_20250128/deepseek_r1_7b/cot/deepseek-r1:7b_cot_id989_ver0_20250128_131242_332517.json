    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query where someone wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 19-year-old male, and they want me to assign relative weights to each risk factor before predicting his rearrest recidivism over three years.\n\nFirst, let's break down the factors given:\n\n- Age: 19, White.\n- Arrests: one time, not convicted.\n- Height/Weight: 6'3\" and 223 lbs. Not sure if this is a risk factor, but maybe obesity could be, but no info here.\n- Marital status: Never married, living alone.\n- Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n- Employment: No jobs held in the past year.\n- Drug use: No drugs in past four years.\n- Depression: Not felt over past month.\n\nUpbringing: lived with both parents at a young age in an urban area. Believes God has something to do with his life.\n\nNow, thinking about risk factors for recidivism:\n\n1. **Age**: 19 might be too early, but sometimes younger individuals can have higher recidivism rates due to impulsive decisions.\n2. **Previous Arrests**: One non-convicted arrest could indicate potential trouble, but since it's not a conviction, maybe lower risk here.\n3. **Marital Status/Living Alone**: Unstable living situation might lead to more issues, possibly increasing risk.\n4. **Employment**: No job in past year is concerning; unemployment can lead to further involvement in the criminal system.\n5. **Drug Use**: No recent use is positive but not a strong factor unless there's substance abuse history.\n6. **Depression**: Not experiencing it now, so perhaps lower risk, but sometimes stress from prior issues might relate to depression.\n\nUpbringing: Living with both parents and urban area might have different influences. Urban environments can be more conducive to criminal activities or stressors, while being raised by both parents might indicate a stable environment, but the individual's current situation (living alone) could offset that.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- **Low**: Age 19 is low risk in general; no drug use or depression are positive. Previous non-convicted arrest is also low.\n- **Medium**: Unstable living situation (living alone after being with parents), lack of employment, and possibly some stressors from the past but not directly linked to recidivism.\n- **High**: No factors here that would push towards high risk.\n\nSo in terms of weight:\n\n- Low: Age 19, no drug use, no depression, non-convicted arrest, living alone? Wait, no, living alone is medium. Maybe the high risk isn't present here at all. So maybe only one low and others are medium or none?\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The person has factors that are medium (upbringing, employment) but not high. So overall prediction would lean towards low to medium risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which may be considered early in life for recidivism, though younger individuals can sometimes exhibit higher recidivism rates due to impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrests\", \"low\", \"One non-convicted arrest does not necessarily indicate a high risk of reoffending, as it is not a conviction and could be a minor infraction.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after being with parents at a young age can potentially increase instability and stress, which may contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Not working during the past year could indicate potential issues with income maintenance or access to resources that might facilitate further criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator of substance abuse prevention and may correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests current mental well-being, which can be indicative of lower stress levels that might influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing and Family Environment\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban area with both biological parents present could provide a stable environment, though the individual is currently living alone, which may offset this benefit.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
