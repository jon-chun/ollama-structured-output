    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the rearrest recidivism prediction for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested three times but not convicted. That might indicate some past behavior issues, but since it's non-conviction, maybe it doesn't show as much risk yet. So medium risk because it's a warning sign but not confirmed with convictions.\n\nShe weighs 140 lbs and is 5'2\". Weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism studies, but she's of average or below average weight for her height. Maybe no significant impact here\u2014probably low risk.\n\nLiving alone suggests she might have some stability, but it could also mean less support network. But since she's an adult and seems responsible otherwise, maybe medium risk from that perspective.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which usually indicates higher education leading to better job prospects. That would lower her risk because education typically correlates with lower recidivism rates\u2014so low.\n\nHeld six jobs in a year\u2014that's quite a lot of work experience. More stable and possibly more responsible behavior can reduce recidivism. So low risk from this factor.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use alone doesn't always lead to recidivism if there are positive factors, but it's still concerning. Maybe medium risk here because of the substance use without recent issues.\n\nYoung age at which she lived with her biological mother in a small rural household for much of her life. Being raised in a rural area might have different social influences. If she's now living alone and is an adult, perhaps less risk from that\u2014but I'm not sure if that's high or low. Maybe medium because it could affect behavior but isn't directly linked to recidivism without more info.\n\nBelieves in God\u2014religion can influence behavior, but unless there's evidence of problematic behavior, maybe no direct impact on recidivism\u2014it could be low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium overall. The non-convictions and past drug use are concerns, but her education, stable living situation, job experience, and positive religious belief balance it out.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Non-Conviction Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Three non-conviction arrests may indicate underlying behavioral issues that could escalate if not addressed.
