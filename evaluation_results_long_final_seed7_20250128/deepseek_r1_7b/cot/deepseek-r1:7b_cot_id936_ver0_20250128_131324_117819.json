    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I know that race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic issues like disparities in the criminal justice system and access to resources, but at 21 years old, maybe these factors aren't as significant yet. So perhaps this isn't a high risk factor.\n\nHe has one arrest and hasn't been convicted. That's just a misdemeanor, I think. If it were a felony, that might be more concerning, but since he's not convicted for his arrest, maybe the impact is lower.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant here. It\u2019s unlikely that being 5'8\" or weighing 170 lbs affects recidivism rates directly unless there's something about his body type influencing substance use, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nHe\u2019s living alone, not married, and never been in a committed relationship. Maybe he has fewer social networks to turn to if he starts using drugs again, so this could slightly lower the risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn\u2019t in college. Not having a higher education might mean less stable job opportunities or fewer resources that could help him avoid substance abuse.\n\nHe\u2019s used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That's interesting because drug use can lead to various mental health issues, but if he's not feeling depressed now, maybe his motivation is waning or he's managing it differently. Not sure how this affects recidivism though.\n\nAt a young age, he lived in a household of two. Maybe less supervision could contribute to higher risk factors like drug use or other risky behavior early on.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. That\u2019s a strong moral support system which might help him stay on track and not engage in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: His past convictions are low, he's young, so maybe the factors pointing towards high risk like drug use aren't enough yet. He also has some positive traits like living alone and having a GED. So I'm leaning towards lower risk but not zero.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor:\n\n- **Race (White)**: Low influence as it's at an early age, so likely not a high risk factor.\n- **Arrest/Misdemeanor**: One arrest, not convicted; low risk contribution.\n- **Social Status (Living Alone)**: Potential support from living alone could reduce risk slightly.\n- **Education Level (GED)**: Lower education might correlate with higher recidivism but in this case, he's avoiding substances recently.\n- **Drug Use**: Past use but no current severe mental health issues; might not be a high risk.\n- **Family Environment**: Small household size contributing to potential isolation or increased risky behavior.\n- **Moral Support (Belief in God)**: Strong support likely mitigates risk.\n\nConsidering these factors collectively, the overall risk is assessed as low. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"At 21 years old, race may not significantly influence recidivism rates yet due to systemic disparities not being fully present.), \n    (\"Arrest/Misdemeanor\", \"low\", \"One non-convicted arrest is a minor offense and does not strongly correlate with high recidivism risk at this stage of life.\"), \n    (\"Social Status (Living Alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may offer some protective factors but could also be isolating, potentially leading to increased risky behavior if stress arises.\"), \n    (\"Education Level (GED)\", \"low\", \"Having a GED can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to less access to resources or more substance use risks, but in this case, recent drug use is noted and no severe mental health issues are mentioned.), \n    (\"Drug Use Past Four Years\", \"medium\", \"Drug use history could increase risk of future substance abuse, which may contribute to recidivism.
