    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for a 21-year-old male who is trying to get a risk assessment. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. I remember that race can be a factor in recidivism studies because of potential systemic issues or socioeconomic disparities. But since he's White and there isn't specific information about any racial discrimination here, maybe this doesn't add much weight. So perhaps it's low risk.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction. Arrests without convictions might mean he hasn't faced the consequences yet, so maybe lower risk compared to someone with a conviction. Still, one arrest could be significant, but not sure how high the risk is here.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and 180 lbs. Weight isn't directly related unless there are issues like substance abuse or health problems. No mention of health issues, so this might be low to medium? Maybe low since no direct association given.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014age 21 is young, so he's probably in the early stages of life. Living independently at such a young age could indicate maturity, which might mean lower risk compared to someone who is dependent or has family issues. So perhaps low.\n\nHigh school diploma not enrolled in college. Education level can influence recidivism; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism because of better job opportunities and support systems. So this would be a protective factor\u2014low risk here.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs usually means more stable income, so this is a positive sign, indicating low risk.\n\nNo drug use in past four years. Drug abuse is a major predictor of recidivism; no use here is a strong indicator against reoffending\u2014so high protective factor, meaning low risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month. Emotional well-being affects mental health which can influence behavior. If he's not depressed, it suggests better mental health\u2014so another positive sign for low risk.\n\nAt a young age, lived with both parents in a household of four in an urban area. Being raised in a stable, supportive environment is usually protective against recidivism. Urban areas might have more resources and support systems, so this would be low risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events\u2014religion can influence life choices but doesn't directly predict recidivism unless there's evidence of sin or moral issues. Since it's stated he believes in God without specific issues, maybe medium risk? Or perhaps no direct impact, so could still be low.\n\nPutting all these together: one arrest (medium), living alone with no family support (low), high school diploma and job stability (high protective). So the overall risk is probably low. But since one arrest exists, I should consider that as a mitigating factor but not too significant in this case.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Racial Background\", \"low\", \"His race is White, which may be associated with systemic issues or socioeconomic disparities, but there's no specific information indicating any discrimination affecting his risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without a conviction could suggest potential for future involvement in the justice system, though it doesn't guarantee reoffending immediately.\"),\n    (\"Body Metrics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly linked to recidivism unless accompanied by health issues or substance abuse, which are not indicated here.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at a young age with no family support suggests independence and maturity, which are protective factors against reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment indicates potential for better job opportunities and support systems, reducing risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding 4 jobs during the year demonstrates stability and financial independence, further reducing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong indicator of sobriety and reduced likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests positive emotional health, which correlates with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living in a stable household of four within an urban area provides a supportive environment with access to resources, further reducing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Believing in God may influence life choices but without evidence of moral issues or sin, it doesn't significantly affect the risk assessment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
