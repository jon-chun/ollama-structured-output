    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk of a 22-year-old male rearrest within three years. Let me go through all the factors provided.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with five arrests and previous convictions. That's pretty significant; multiple prior convictions are usually strong indicators of higher recidivism risk.\n\nHe's White, but I don't think race is a factor here unless there's specific data suggesting otherwise, which isn't indicated here. So maybe no impact on the risk factors.\n\nAt 5'6\" and weighing between 150-174 lbs, his weight might be relevant if it's affecting his ability to get jobs or support, but without info on health issues, I can\u2019t say for sure.\n\nLiving alone is a factor; living with family can reduce stress and support. But he's an adult, so maybe not the biggest risk here.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Education is a big risk factor because without it, he might struggle to find better opportunities post-incarceration.\n\nHe hasn't held a job during the past year; unemployment can lead to dependency on substance abuse and other negative behaviors that increase recidivism.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates, especially if it's ongoing or recent.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area. That might suggest family stress or environment issues that could impact his behavior.\n\nReligious belief in God; some personal beliefs can influence behavior but not sure how directly related to recidivism here without more info.\n\nPutting this all together, multiple risk factors point towards high risk: prior convictions, lack of education, unemployment, drug use. So I'd predict a high chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with five arrests and previous convictions, which are strong indicators of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED combined with not being enrolled in college increases the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors post-release.\"), \n    (\"Unemployment\", \"medium\", \"Not holding a job during the past year may lead to dependency on substance abuse and other negative behaviors that can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years, along with feelings of low mood recently, suggests ongoing substance use which is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at an adult age may not be inherently risky but could be a contributing factor if it leads to isolation or lack of support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year.
