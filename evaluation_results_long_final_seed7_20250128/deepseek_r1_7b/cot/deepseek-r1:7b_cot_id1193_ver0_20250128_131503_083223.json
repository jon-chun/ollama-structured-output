    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk of a 20-year-old Black male with several factors contributing to potential rearrest. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a significant factor; prior convictions are strongly linked to recidivism. So that's high risk.\n\nHis height (5'7\") and weight (140 lbs) don't directly indicate risk but might relate to possible substance use or health issues, which could be relevant later. Probably low intrinsic risk from these factors alone.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can influence social support and stability, so maybe a medium effect on recidivism.\n\nEducation is another point\u2014no high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Educational barriers often lead to unstable situations, increasing risk here.\n\nEmployment history: he has held 3 jobs in the past year. Employed individuals are generally less likely to become involved with the criminal system, so this might lower his risk, perhaps medium.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently.Marijuana is not as harmful as other substances like cocaine or heroin, so maybe a low impact on recidivism here.\n\nHe was raised in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of four. Growing up in such a setting might have social and emotional challenges, which could increase risk, perhaps medium to high.\n\nHis belief in God suggests he's religious but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it affects his behavior, which isn't certain here\u2014maybe low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest is the biggest red flag (high), education issues (medium), living alone and not married (medium). Drug use (low), employment history (medium), family background (medium to high), and religion (low). The overall prediction leans towards high risk, so I'd predict YES with a confidence around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism as it demonstrates past involvement in the criminal system, which can lead to similar behavior again.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED combined with not being enrolled in college can indicate potential barriers to accessing opportunities and avoiding substance abuse or unstable environments.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a partner may reduce social support, which is often linked to higher recidivism rates due to isolation and lack of accountability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Having held 3 jobs in the past year suggests a stable income and reduced exposure to criminal influences compared to someone unemployed or underemployed in high-risk sectors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Using marijuana over the past four years, while not significantly harmful like harder drugs, may still indicate potential substance abuse issues that could lead to increased risk ifabuse escalates.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium-high\", \"Growing up in an urban household of four with limited family support can contribute to emotional and social challenges that may be precursors to criminal behavior or increased risk of relapse.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
