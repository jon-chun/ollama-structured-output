    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the recidivism risk for a 19-year-old male based on his background. Let's break down each factor.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one prior conviction. That's significant because recidivism is more likely in individuals with a past of criminal behavior. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHis age being 19 might indicate he's still developing socially and emotionally, which could make him more prone to relapse. But since it's his first offense, maybe the foundation is good. I'll consider this as medium or low depending on other factors.\n\nHe uses drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major indicator of recidivism because it can affect judgment, relationships, and job performance. This should definitely be a high factor.\n\nHis living situation: single, no kids, not married. Limited support network could increase his chances of failing to appear for court or getting involved in risky situations. Medium risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. This is positive because mental health issues might contribute to substance abuse but since he's not depressed now, maybe it slightly lowers risk, making this a low factor.\n\nBiological mother living with him at age 5 in an urban area suggests exposure to potential stressors like poverty or neglect early on. This can have long-term effects and increase risk\u2014so high.\n\nHe believes in God as something affecting his life. Religious beliefs can provide support but might also lead to risky decisions influenced by religion, so medium effect.\n\nPutting it all together: one prior conviction is a strong indicator of high risk. Substance abuse significantly increases the chance. Living alone with no support could moderate some factors but not enough to bring them down. The other factors don't outweigh these negatives. So overall, the prediction leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana/Cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Use of drugs in the past four years is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates and can impede an individual's ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a support network may increase risk of not appearing for court or engaging in risky behavior, but it does not appear to be as significant as other factors in this case.\"),\n    (\"No Depression in Past Month\", \"low\", \"The absence of depression in the past month may suggest better mental health and decreased likelihood of substance abuse triggers which could have contributed to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Early Exposure (Living with Biological Mother)\", \"high\", \"Exposure to a neglectful household at age 5 is strongly associated with increased risk of criminal behavior due to potential environmental stressors and lack of supervision.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"While religious beliefs may provide some personal support, they can also lead to risky decisions influenced by religion, which does not appear to be as significant as other factors in this case.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
