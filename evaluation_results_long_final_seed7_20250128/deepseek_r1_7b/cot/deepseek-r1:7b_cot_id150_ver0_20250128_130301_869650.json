His factors include past drug use (marijuana), living alone without a support network, and a young upbringing in an urban area.\n\nFirst, his high recidivism rate due to multiple arrests is a strong indicator for high risk. Drug use could also increase the likelihood of future offenses or relapses.\n\nLiving alone suggests he might not have a stable environment, which often correlates with higher risk behaviors. His past living situation as a young person in a household of three might leave him vulnerable to similar situations if he encounters difficulties again.\n\nHis lack of college enrollment and part-time job could mean limited opportunities for upward mobility, contributing to longer-term stability issues. His belief in God might offer some moral guidance but isn't a mitigating factor against recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors point strongly towards high risk. I'll predict he's likely to rearrest within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"multiple arrests history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant history of arrests (6 times) and convictions, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years could indicate potential substance abuse issues, which are often linked to criminal behavior and increased risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and may increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking help when needed, contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"young upbringing in a household of 3 in an urban area\", \"medium\", \"Experiencing living with his biological mother at a young age could suggest instability or potential issues that might contribute to risk behaviors over time.\"),\n    (\"limited educational background\", \"low\", \"Currently not enrolled in college despite having a high school diploma, which may indicate limited opportunities for positive development and stability.\"),\n    (\"single status\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a partner may not directly correlate with higher recidivism rates but could suggest a lack of social support network which might be a contributing factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
