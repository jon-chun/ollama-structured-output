    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the risk factors provided. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 19, which is quite young, but it might be a positive because younger individuals sometimes have more potential or less criminal history. But since her offense count isn't high (only one arrest), maybe that doesn't offset much.\n\nEthnicity: White. From the examples, White individuals had mixed outcomes depending on other factors. So I can\u2019t make a strong assumption here; it's better to note this as medium because sometimes race is associated with systemic issues but not always predictive without more data.\n\nRisk of reoffending: She was arrested once, so that\u2019s one conviction? Wait, no, she hasn't been convicted yet\u2014only arrested. So maybe lower risk there. But the fact that she's currently employed (holding 5 jobs) might indicate better stability than some cases I\u2019ve seen where people are unemployed and have higher recidivism.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college, which could mean she's committed to learning or changing her situation\u2014so maybe this is low risk compared to someone with no education.\n\nLiving situation: Living alone isn't necessarily bad; it might indicate independence. But being single without children (since household size is 3) might suggest she has support from family elsewhere. Maybe medium risk here because living arrangements can vary a lot based on other factors like family structure or location.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, but some of the time she felt down recently\u2014so maybe there's an underlying mental health issue contributing to her drug use. That could be a medium factor as drug use often correlates with other issues that might lead to more problems.\n\nMental health: Her mood swings or feeling down could indicate a mental health issue, which can contribute to substance abuse and other behaviors\u2014not sure if this is high but definitely contributes to risk factors.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: She lived with both parents in a household of 3. This might have provided stability initially, so maybe lower recidivism here\u2014so low or medium depending on the context.\n\nReligion: She believes God has something to do with her life, which is generally associated with positive outcomes and good behavior. So this could be a high factor because religious belief can promote ethical living.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nAge: 19 \u2013 Low risk due to potential for growth but limited history.\nEthnicity: White \u2013 Medium as not alone enough info without other factors.\nRisk of reoffending: No prior convictions, only an arrest \u2013 Low since no full conviction yet.\nEducation: High school diploma in college \u2013 Medium, but good stability.\nLiving situation: Alone with two parents \u2013 Medium, some support present.\nDrug use: Past four years and recent mood issues \u2013 Medium risk as substance abuse can escalate.\nMental health: Negative feelings \u2013 Medium contributing factor.\nHousehold size: Small at young age \u2013 Low or medium depending on context; maybe low if stable.\nReligion: Believes in God \u2013 High positive influence.\n\nGiven these factors, I think the overall risk is Medium. The presence of drug use and mood issues might lean it towards a higher risk, but her education and being with both parents could mitigate some factors. So my prediction would be YES for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"Medium\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which presents some potential despite limited criminal history.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"Medium\", \"White ethnicity can sometimes indicate systemic issues without additional context about family dynamics or socioeconomic status.\"),\n    (\"Risk of Reoffending\", \"Low\", \"Only one arrest and no prior convictions suggest a lower risk of reoffending compared to those with more severe offenses or multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"Medium\", \"High school diploma in college indicates some commitment to further education, which may correlate with lower recidivism risk compared to those without education or in correctional facilities.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone at 19 years old can sometimes suggest independence but may lack the support provided by living with parents, depending on family structure and location.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"Medium\", \"Past four years of drug use (marijuana and cocaine) along with recent mood issues underscores a potential for increased risk of substance abuse-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"Medium\", \"Recent feelings of downness or lack of cheerfulness could indicate underlying mental health issues that contribute to substance abuse and other behaviors, increasing the risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"Low\", \"Living with both parents in a household size of 3 initially provides some stability, which can be mitigating compared to larger households commonly associated with higher recidivism risks. \"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"High\", \"Belief in God is generally associated with positive outcomes and ethical living, reducing the risk of substance abuse and other negative behaviors that contribute to recidivism.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held 5 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
