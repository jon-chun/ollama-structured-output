    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case for a 18-year-old White male. Let me break down the factors one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young, but that might not directly impact recidivism unless there's something about his behavior at such a young age. He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That's one arrest; sometimes being arrested even without a conviction can still indicate some risk.\n\nHis height and weight: 6 feet 9 inches and 185 lbs. I'm not sure if that affects recidivism, but maybe in some contexts it could relate to other factors like substance use or health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor because he's responsible for himself, but it also depends on the environment, which isn't clear here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Educational attainment is usually linked to lower recidivism, so this might be a protective factor.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Job stability can influence re-arrest rates; having fewer jobs might mean less steady income or less social support.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Using drugs can sometimes lead to more risky behavior, but not always. The lack of recent depression isn't a strong indicator here.\n\nHousehold size at age: He lived with both parents in a household of four. That might suggest he had some support, which could be protective against recidivism if the environment was stable.\n\nHis belief about God: He doesn't see God as affecting his personal events. This might relate to his outlook on life; some people who don't have a religious connection might face different challenges that could increase risk.\n\nPutting this all together from the examples given, let's look at Example 1 and 2 where outcomes were NO, which means no rearrest within three years. In those cases, factors like being married, having a high school diploma, holding jobs, not using drugs recently, etc., were protective.\n\nIn our case, he has one arrest but no conviction. He's young, so maybe that's less of an issue. He's living alone, which might be a bit risky if his circumstances change. His job history is minimal, which could lead to instability. He uses marijuana, and while not feeling depressed now, past use can still be a risk factor.\n\nHowever, he has a diploma and no college, so that's positive. The household size was four, but it was with both parents in an urban area? Wait, the example doesn't specify, but Example 3 is rural, which might have different implications.\n\nHis belief about God not affecting him could be seen as a lack of strong support system, which might increase risk if he faces personal struggles or instability.\n\nSo considering all these factors: one arrest (moderate), living alone (medium to high risk depending on circumstances), job history (low), educational background (protective), drug use but no recent depression (moderate), and belief in God not affecting him (could be a protective factor if he's stable, but maybe a medium if he has personal issues).\n\nI think the high risk factors here are living alone, one arrest, and maybe his belief about God. The low factors are education and job history.\n\nPutting it together, I'd lean towards a NO outcome with moderate confidence because some of the negative factors (like living alone) might tip it in that direction, but he has positive factors like education which could mitigate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 18 years old, which may indicate youth and potential for developing risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without a conviction might suggest prior behavior that could impact future stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can be risky if circumstances change or there are personal issues.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Held only one job, which may indicate limited income and support network.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment might show some educational stability but not necessarily protection against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years with no recent depression suggesting possible control over substance use.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in a household of four, which may provide support but could also have issues if circumstances change.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"medium\", \"Doesn't feel God affects his personal events; this might indicate a lack of religious support system.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 9 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
