    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this case based on the examples provided. Let me start by reviewing each risk factor and assigning a weight\u2014low, medium, or high.\n\nFirst, the person is 19 years old, which might be a minor factor since he's still young. Next, being Hispanic isn't directly tied to recidivism in most studies unless there's specific data suggesting otherwise, so I'll consider it as low risk here.\n\nHe has one arrest but no conviction\u2014arrests can sometimes predict future behavior, but without a conviction, maybe the impact is lower compared to someone who's convicted. So medium.\n\nHis weight is 160 lbs; not sure how significant this is unless combined with other factors like past substance use or living conditions.\n\nHe\u2019s single and living alone\u2014single individuals might be at higher risk because they have fewer support systems. That could be a high-risk factor, maybe high.\n\nNo education level\u2014he didn\u2019t finish high school or get a GED, so that's another negative indicator for recidivism. High weight.\n\nHe held five jobs in the past year\u2014that\u2019s quite stable. Employment is usually linked to lower recidivism because it provides stability and financial independence. So low risk.\n\nDrug use: only marijuana in the past four years\u2014marijuana is sometimes associated with higher recidivism, but since he hasn\u2019t felt depressed recently, maybe this isn't as impactful. Medium.\n\nMood swings or feeling down a lot could indicate mental health issues, which can contribute to substance abuse and other offenses. Medium risk here.\n\nLiving in an urban area where he's with adults not related by blood\u2014household size 3\u2014could have different dynamics compared to rural areas. Maybe medium risk because urban environments might have different social factors.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014he's religious, which can sometimes be protective but also could indicate other issues if problematic. Medium.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest (medium), living alone (high), no education (high). The rest are either medium or low. So the high-risk factors might tip the prediction towards a YES.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 19 years old, which may be considered minor in terms of recidivism risk as they are still developing their life experiences and decision-making processes.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being Hispanic does not inherently predict higher recidivism; however, it's important to consider cultural factors if available data supports a connection.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having one arrest but no conviction may indicate potential past behavior that could influence future actions, though without a conviction, the impact is likely lower compared to someone who has been convicted.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"The person weighs 160 lbs; while weight can be an indicator in some contexts, it does not directly correlate with recidivism risk without additional context about health or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases the likelihood of isolation and potential mental health issues, which could contribute to substance abuse or other behavioral problems.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED significantly impacts recidivism risk as educational attainment is linked to better job opportunities and reduced criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"low\", \"Holding five jobs in the past year suggests stability and financial independence, which are typically associated with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years may be a minor issue if accompanied by no other substance use or related behavioral problems, but it can still be concerning for recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mood Swings\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down significantly during the past month could indicate underlying mental health issues that might influence behavior and substance use in the future.\"),\n    (\"Household Composition\", \"medium\", \"Living with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 3 suggests potential challenges or stressors, but urban living can also provide different dynamics that may not necessarily increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with one's life does not inherently predict higher recidivism risk; however, it could indicate other issues if problematic if additional factors are considered.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
