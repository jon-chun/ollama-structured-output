    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, the user provided three examples of risk factors and their outcomes regarding recidivism over three years. Now they've given a new case and asked for an analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to look at each risk factor in the new case and assign a low, medium, or high weight based on the examples. The person is 19-year-old female Hispanic, with 10 arrests and convictions, which seems severe compared to the examples. Her living situation is alone, which might be more concerning than others.\n\nShe has a GED but isn't in college, similar to Example #2. She's worked three jobs, less than Examples 1 and 3 who had four each. Drug use includes marijuana and cocaine, which could be significant. Her mental health issues are severe, as she's feeling down a lot.\n\nHer past living with her mother in an urban area might have different dynamics compared to the examples. She doesn't believe in God, which is interesting but maybe not directly relevant here.\n\nConsidering these factors, her high number of arrests and convictions should be weighted highly. Drug use and mental health issues also add to the risk. Her age (19) might be a minor factor since she's already been through many stops. Living alone doesn't directly align with any example but could indicate higher risk.\n\nPutting it all together, these factors suggest a high risk of recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 10 times and convicted, which is significantly more than the examples provided.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 171 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
