    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment case step by step. I'm going to analyze each factor given for the individual and then determine their relative weights based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, looking at Example #1: The person is a Black male with several risk factors like living in a large household, being Hispanic, etc., but he had a NO outcome. His high school diploma might have played a role since not completing could increase risk.\n\nIn Example #2: A Black 19-year-old with no prior convictions and living alone also resulted in NO, despite using marijuana. Not being married and living alone is noted as low risk.\n\nExample #3: A White male with multiple arrests, drug use, feeling down, and a small household had a YES outcome\u2014so higher risk factors led to recidivism.\n\nNow, the case we're evaluating:\n\n- Age 22, White male.\n- Arrested once, not convicted.\n- Physical stats: 5'7\", 145 lbs. Not relevant for risk assessment beyond general info.\n- Living alone with no spouse or children\u2014low stability, which is a known risk factor.\n- High school diploma; enrolled in college? No, so maybe slightly lower risk from education.\n- Held 1 job last year\u2014not much job instability but could be related to unemployment.\n- Drug use: None in past four years. Feelings of depression: most of the time he's down. This is a significant factor\u2014mild depression can affect motivation and decision-making, increasing recidivism chances.\n- Young age when lived with both parents, household size 3\u2014a stable environment initially but not sure how that affects now.\n\nComparing to examples:\n\nHis lack of prior conviction and being White might have lower risk than Hispanic or Black in Example #1. His living alone (low risk) vs. Example #2's single living situation\u2014similar? Not entirely sure.\n\nDrug use: No use here, so lower risk from substance abuse compared to Example #3 who used both marijuana and cocaine.\n\nDepression: He feels down a lot, which is a strong indicator of potential issues affecting his ability to reintegrate or commit crimes. This aligns with Example #3's feelings of depression leading to YES.\n\nHousehold size 3: Slightly better than Example #1's household size 7 but not as stable as being with both parents in Example #3.\n\nEducation: High school diploma\u2014similar to Example #2 who didn't have a diploma, so maybe slightly lower risk here.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nHigh risk factors would be living alone and feelings of depression. Since he has no drug use now, that's not an issue. His age might be more stable than the 19-year-olds in Examples 1 and 2 but less stable than being with both parents.\n\nThe lack of prior convictions is positive, but the other factors like depression weigh heavily. The household size isn't as strong a risk factor as living alone or feeling down.\n</think>\n\n{\"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"His arrest history indicates he has a single non-convicted offense, which may suggest limited prior criminal behavior compared to recidivistic examples in Examples 1 and 3 where multiple offenses were present.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally associated with lower risk as seen in Example 2, but the household size of 3 adds a slight nuance compared to larger households in Example 1.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"high\", \"He has reported feeling down most of the past month, which, similar to Example 3 where depression was noted, suggests potential behavioral issues that could influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment may be slightly below the more educated individuals in Examples 1 and 2 but still relevant as seen in Example 2's no recidivism despite not having a diploma.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Holding one job for a year is not typically a significant risk factor, especially if it shows stability.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
