    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case. Let me start by breaking down each risk factor and assigning a weight based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 22 years old. In Example #1, a 21-year-old with similar factors had an NO outcome. Being one year older might slightly increase the risk compared to someone who's younger. So I'm thinking maybe medium risk here.\n\nEthnicity: He identifies as White, which in Example #3 was associated with a YES outcome despite multiple arrests. However, being White isn't always a guarantee of lower recidivism. It might be a neutral factor overall, so perhaps low weight.\n\nNumber of prior arrests and convictions: He's been arrested 4 times but not convicted yet. Comparing to Examples #1 (1 arrest) with NO and Example #2 (1 arrest, no conviction) also NO, having more arrests without convictions could indicate higher risk. So high weight here.\n\nHeight and weight: He's 6 feet 4 inches, which is tall, and weighs 190 lbs. The examples don't have specific height or weight data, but being tall might not directly correlate with recidivism unless it affects employment or something else indirectly. Maybe low to medium risk.\n\nMarital status: Currently not living alone, which could mean a support network. In Example #2, someone living alone had an NO outcome, so this factor is positive. Medium weight.\n\nEducation level and college enrollment: He has a diploma and is in college. Education usually lowers recidivism, but being enrolled might indicate he's working on something. So maybe low risk here.\n\nNumber of jobs held: He's held only 1 job during the year. More stable employment reduces risk, so this could be medium or high depending on context.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and feels down sometimes. Drug use is a known risk factor, especially recent or frequent use. High weight here.\n\nReligion: He believes God has no role in his life, which can affect motivation towards positive change. Maybe slightly lower risk compared to others with strong religious involvement, but not sure yet.\n\nHousehold size at age of arrest: He lived with his biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area. Larger households often have more support and resources, which might reduce risk. So maybe low weight here.\n\nOverall social circumstances: Being in an urban area can mean more stressors or higher crime rates. Medium to high risk based on that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Prior arrests (high)\n- Drug use (high)\n- Relocation (medium)\n- Single living situation with support (medium positive)\n- Education and college (low to medium)\n- Job holding (moderate)\n\nSo the overall recidivism seems higher. Considering his past convictions, multiple arrests without convictions, drug use, and being in an urban area where he's not living alone but might have other social challenges.\n\nI think his risk is high for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of each factor:\n\n1. **Number of prior arrests and convictions**: High\n2. **Drug use (marijuana)**: High\n3. **Household size at age of arrest**: Medium\n4. **Age**: Medium\n5. **Education level**: Low to Medium\n6. **Marital status**: Medium\n7. **Religion**: Low\n8. **Social circumstances (urban area)**: Medium\n\nGiven the high weight on factors like prior arrests, drug use, and living in an urban environment without strong support, the prediction is:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"High risk due to multiple arrests without convictions which indicate potential for instability or lack of motivation to change\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially marijuana, often correlates with higher recidivism rates as it can impede personal responsibility and future opportunities\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Lived in a household of 4, which may offer support but urban environment could introduce additional stressors\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old, slightly older than the examples which had NO outcomes indicating potential for higher risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low_to_medium\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in college, education typically lowers recidivism but ongoing enrollment may not directly correlate with lower risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone, which could indicate a support network that might mitigate risk factors\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believes God has no role, which can be associated with less motivation towards positive change or seeking help\"),\n    (\"urban_area\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area which may present more stressors and higher crime rates contributing to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
