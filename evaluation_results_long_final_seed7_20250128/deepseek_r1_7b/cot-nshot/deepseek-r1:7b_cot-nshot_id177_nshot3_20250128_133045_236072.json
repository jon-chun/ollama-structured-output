    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given case based on the provided examples and assign weights to each risk factor. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list all the risk factors in the current case:\n\n- Age: 18 years old (not directly mentioned in previous examples as a significant factor)\n- Hispanic/Black identification: Black\n- Number of arrests: 1, not convicted\n- Height: 6 feet 0 inches\n- Marital status: Never married, currently living alone\n- Education level: Not enrolled in school now; previously no high school diploma or GED\n- Employment: Held no jobs during the year\n- Drug use: No drugs used in past four years\n- Depression: Felt down some of the time in the past month\n- Household size at a young age: 4 (lived with biological mother)\n- God's role: Believes God has something to do\n\nNow, comparing these factors with Example #1 and #2:\n\nExample #1: Black, 21, arrested once convicted. Other factors not as relevant for recidivism.\n\nExample #2: Black, 19, no prior conviction, other non-relevant factors. Outcome was NO.\n\nIn the current case, the person is Black (similar to examples), but unconvicted after arrest. He's 6'0\", which isn't in Example #3 as a factor, so maybe no impact. Never married, living alone: similar to Examples 1 and 2.\n\nHe has not held jobs; perhaps this indicates instability, but not directly tied to recidivism examples. Drug use negative for recid, but he hasn't used drugs recently.\n\nHe's had depression in the past month, which is a risk factor. Also, household size at age was 4 (rural? Urban?) \u2013 Example #3 mentions rural, but this one is urban.\n\nHis education level: no high school diploma and not enrolled now. Previous Examples showed higher education sometimes linked to lower recidivism, but here he's without it. God's role is present.\n\nPutting weights:\n\n- Age 18 vs previous examples with higher age \u2013 maybe low weight.\n- Black identity: medium (as in Examples)\n- Unconvicted after arrest: high risk for future offenses.\n- No job: medium\n- No drugs: low to no effect on recid.\n- Depression: high impact\n- Small household: maybe medium\n- God's role: medium\n\nCombining these, the factors point towards a higher risk. The person is Black and unconvicted after arrest, which are strong indicators of possible future offenses. Depression adds to that.\n\nSo prediction would lean towards YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which may indicate a period where risk behaviors might be more prevalent but not directly tied to recidivism as significantly compared to other factors like prior convictions or household size.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Being Black is associated with higher recidivism rates in previous examples and may contribute to increased risk factors for future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"One arrest, unconvicted, which suggests potential for reoffending based on past experiences and lack of prior legal outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Not employed during the year, indicating possible instability or reliance on other factors like family support which may influence risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drugs used in the past four years; substance abuse is a known risk factor but this individual has not been involved recently.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"high\", \"Felt down some of the time, which can significantly impact decision-making and risk-taking behaviors that may lead to criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 4; household dynamics can influence mental health and decision-making, though not directly tied to recidivism as much as other factors.\"),\n    (\"God's Role\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has something to do with his life, which may affect motivation but does not directly correlate with higher or lower recidivism rates in previous examples.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
