    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me start by going through each of his risk factors one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's 18 years old, which is a relatively low age, but since he's been arrested twice and convicted, that might be more concerning. The first example had someone with similar characteristics (19-year-old Black) who was not rearrested within three years despite being convicted once. But this person has two convictions at 18, so that could indicate higher risk.\n\nHis weight is 145 lbs, which isn't extremely high, but his height is 5'9\", which isn't particularly tall either. Doesn't seem directly relevant to recidivism based on the examples.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone, similar to Example #2 where someone also lived alone without a spouse. But in that example, the outcome was NO. So maybe living alone doesn't necessarily predict rearrest unless there are other factors involved.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college, which could indicate lower educational support system. Education is often linked with better job opportunities, which can reduce recidivism risk if someone has stable employment. But since he's not working either, that might be a negative factor.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year, so unemployment status isn't contributing positively to his situation. Unemployment can sometimes lead to more substance use and stress, which are factors in Example #2 where the person didn't feel depressed but still had no recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so that's a positive indicator of self-control compared to someone who has struggled with drug abuse. But he did feel very down during the month, which might indicate low mood or stress. In Example #2, feeling down didn't lead to a recidivism outcome.\n\nLiving at a young age in an urban area, specifically with his biological mother in a household of five. The third example had someone who lived with both parents and was White, but this person is Black, lived alone, and the household size was 5. Urban living can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or different social environments that might affect recidivism. However, the other examples didn't show a direct correlation based on urban vs rural settings.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life, which suggests he's in a supportive religious environment. In Example #3, someone who felt that God had nothing to do with him had a YES outcome, but this person feels supported by God. Supportive environments often aid in personal growth and stability, so that could be a mitigating factor.\n\nPutting it all together: He has two prior convictions at a young age, which is concerning. His living situation in an urban area might not directly correlate with higher rearrest rates based on the examples, but his low educational background adds to the risk. Not working or enrolled in school could limit opportunities for positive changes. Despite feeling very down, he hasn't used drugs recently, so that's a good sign.\n\nThe key factors here are the two prior convictions and his lack of education and employment. Those seem to have more significant impacts on recidivism than the other factors mentioned. So I would lean towards a high risk but not certain because some mitigating factors like lack of drug use might influence the outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"He is 18 years old, which is relatively low, but his two prior convictions at this age significantly increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Lacking a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college increases the likelihood of unstable environments affecting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Holding no jobs during the year may indicate a lack of support system, which can contribute to higher risk factors related to substance use and stress.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs for four years is a positive indicator, but feeling very down during the month might suggest underlying stress or low mood that could impact recidivism outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone in an urban area with his biological mother may have different social dynamics compared to other examples, which might slightly affect risk assessment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
