    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old Black male who has been arrested five times with a conviction. His weight is 185 lbs, standing at 6 feet 2 inches. He's not living alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, isn't in college, and only held one job last year. Drug use includes marijuana, and he felt really down recently. He lived with his biological mother in an urban area with five people in the household. He believes God is involved in his life.\n\nFirst, age: 22. Younger than most recidivists but still early adulthood. Maybe higher risk if behavior changes as he gets older.\n\nRace: Black, which sometimes correlates with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues like over-policing and biased sentencing.\n\nNumber of prior arrests and convictions: Five arrests, so a clear history of misconduct or criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of potential for more offenses.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'2\"/185 lbs. Not sure if this affects risk directly unless it's related to health issues causing substance use, but he does have a history.\n\nMarital status: Not married and not living alone\u2014maybe indicates instability or stressors that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED, which might mean limited opportunities and higher chances of engaging in risky behavior again.\n\nEmployment: Only held one job last year. Unemployment for a while could lead to dependency on illegal activities as a means of survival or support.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana use is legal but can have negative consequences. Relapsing into drug use is a risk factor for further issues, including health problems and more crimes.\n\nMood: Recently felt extremely down. Could indicate mental health issues that might affect judgment or willingness to engage in harmful behavior again.\n\nHousehold size and living situation: Lived with his mother in an urban area with five people. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates and social stressors, which could contribute to recidivism. Larger households can also mean more dependency on others for support, potentially leading to substance abuse issues or lack of motivation to change.\n\nReligious belief: Believes God is involved\u2014could be a protective factor if it leads to accountability and seeking help, but if he's struggling with mood swings and substance use, this might not mitigate risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors point towards a high risk. Prior arrests are a big red flag, along with drug use and living conditions that may contribute to instability or poor decision-making.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which places him in an age where he may still be making significant life choices that could impact his recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"His race (Black) is associated with systemic issues such as over-policing and biased sentencing, which can increase recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"He has a history of five arrests and one conviction, indicating past behavior that could lead to similar outcomes in the future.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not being married and not living alone may indicate potential stressors or instability that could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors again.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"He has held only one job during the past year, which may indicate limited income stability and potential dependency on alternative activities for support.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and experiencing low mood could contribute to substance abuse issues and increased risk of further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Living Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in an urban area with five people may expose him to social stressors or environments conducive to substance use and unstable living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"His belief in God could potentially provide a sense of accountability, but combined with other risk factors like drug use and instability, it does not fully mitigate recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
