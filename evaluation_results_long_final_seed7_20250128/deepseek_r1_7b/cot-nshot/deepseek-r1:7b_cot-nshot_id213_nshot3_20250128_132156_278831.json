    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case for a Black male who's 22 years old. He's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Let me go through each of his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals might have fewer recidivist tendencies because they're still developing their skills and life choices. So that's a low weight factor because it doesn't strongly predict recidivism.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. The number of prior arrests can indicate potential for future crimes, so this is a medium weight factor. Two arrests might show some risk compared to someone with more convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 188 lbs. This doesn't directly relate to recidivism unless there's an association with physical labor or other factors not mentioned here. So probably low weight.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living situation can affect support systems, which might influence his behavior. Single living situations sometimes have higher risk because of lack of oversight, so maybe medium weight.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Educational attainment is a significant factor in recidivism; without education, he might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors. That's a high weight factor.\n\nNot enrolled in college. Not being educated and actively engaged in higher education can increase the chances of engaging in risky activities. High weight here too.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment or lack of income maintenance can lead to higher recidivism rates as he might turn to illegal activities for survival. Another high weight factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug abuse is a strong indicator of potential substance-induced crimes, so that's a high weight factor.\n\nNo feelings of depression over the past month. While recent lack of depression might suggest some positivity, chronic issues could be a concern. But since he reported no recent depression, maybe this isn't as significant, but it's still somewhat relevant\u2014maybe medium weight.\n\nLiving with his biological father in a household of size 2. Small households can sometimes correlate with higher stability or lower risk if the family is supportive. However, living with one parent might mean less supervision compared to larger households like Example #1 where he lived with seven siblings. So this could be low weight because smaller households often offer more support.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal life. Religious involvement can have mixed effects; on one hand, it provides a sense of purpose, but on the other, it might influence behavior if it's used to justify negative actions. This is probably medium weight as it doesn't directly correlate with increased risk unless it's used for bad choices.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrests (medium), education (high negative), living alone (medium), unemployment (high negative), drug use (high positive), lack of recent depression (maybe neutral or low), household size (low to medium), and belief in God (medium). The combination leans towards high risk, especially with multiple high weight factors pointing toward recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has been arrested twice but not convicted.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 188 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 2. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
