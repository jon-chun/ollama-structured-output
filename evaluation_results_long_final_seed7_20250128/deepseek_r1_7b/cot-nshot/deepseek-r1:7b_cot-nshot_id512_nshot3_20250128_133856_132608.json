    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the given examples. Let me start by analyzing each risk factor in the provided case.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example #1. The person is a Black male with one prior arrest and conviction. He's 5'8\" and weighs 190 lbs. Married living with spouse, has a HS diploma but not college, held four jobs, used marijuana, lived with seven people as a child, feels no depression recently, God does something in his life.\n\nOutcome: NO rearrest.\n\nExample #2 is similar but the person isn't convicted and lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma. Outcome also NO.\n\nExample #3 is White, three prior arrests (not convicted), taller, more drug use, felt very down for a month with God not involved. Outcome YES.\n\nNow, the case I'm evaluating: 20-year-old Black male arrested once and convicted. 5'10\", 151 lbs. Living alone, HS diploma, held three jobs, no drug use, feels extremely depressed, lived in a household of adults other than biological parents (so maybe foster or adopted) in rural area, God has something to do.\n\nI need to assign weights to each risk factor. Let's go through them one by one.\n\n1. Age: 20 is relatively young but maybe not as much at this stage.\n2. Race: Black - higher risk based on examples (Example #3 had White and YES).\n3. Number of prior arrests and convictions: 1 arrest, 1 conviction. The example with similar factors had a NO outcome.\n4. Physical characteristics: Height and weight don't seem to be significant unless there's something about being at risk for abuse or neglect, but not here.\n5. Marital status: Living alone isn't great, maybe medium.\n6. Education level: HS diploma is average; some studies say it correlates with lower recidivism.\n7. Employment history: Held 3 jobs - positive sign.\n8. Drug use: No past four years and none currently - negative.\n9. Depression: Felt extremely down for a month - high risk factor, could be medium to high depending on impact.\n10. Household at young age: Previous examples had larger households (7 vs. current 3). Maybe lower risk here?\n11. God involvement: No recent connection, which might reduce risk.\n\nNow, considering the outcomes in examples:\n- Convictions are a key factor; having one and being convicted is similar to Example #2 but with more positives.\n- The person's depression could be pushing them towards higher risk despite other mitigating factors.\n\nPutting it all together, while he has some negative factors like prior arrest and living alone, his positive aspects (education, employment) might balance it out. The high-level depression adds risk though.\n\nI think the risk is medium to low because of the positives but with a moderate risk from the prior arrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"20 years old may indicate early onset, which could be a minor risk factor but not significant on its own.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Black individuals historically have higher rearrest rates compared to White or other groups as seen in Example #3 where White outcomes were mixed but Black had a NO outcome despite similar factors.\",\n     ),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"1 prior arrest and conviction moderate risk as seen in Examples #2 where similar factors resulted in a NO outcome, while higher numbers increased rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"Physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not indicate significant risk factors beyond potential abuse or neglect which are not present here.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is moderately concerning but not the most significant factor compared to prior convictions or education level.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"HS diploma with no college attendance is average, correlating with lower recidivism as seen in Example #2 where similar factors resulted in a NO outcome.\",\n     ),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Held 3 jobs during the year which can indicate stability and lower risk of reoffending compared to those with inconsistent work history.'),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drugs used recently, which is a positive factor as seen in Example #2 where similar factors resulted in a NO outcome.\",\n     ),\n    (\"Depression\", \"high\", \"Felt extremely down for a month, which significantly increases the risk of reoffending compared to those who do not experience such profound emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"Household at Young Age\", \"low\", \"Lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of size 3, which is less concerning than larger households as seen in Example #2 where higher household size did not significantly increase risk.\",\n     ),\n    (\"God Involved\", \"medium\", \"No recent connection to God, which may be positive but varies based on personal belief system and support network.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Currently employed full-time or part-time due to being in a job for 3 years without any mention of unemployment or underemployment.\"),\n    (\"Realtors' Input or Other Factors\", \"low\", \"No additional factors provided beyond the given risk assessment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 151 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
