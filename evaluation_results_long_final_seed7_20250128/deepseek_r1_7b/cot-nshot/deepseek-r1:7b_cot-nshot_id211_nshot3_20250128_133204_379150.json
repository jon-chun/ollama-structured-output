    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: She's 20 years old. Younger than Examples 1 and 2 who were both 19 or 21, but Example 3 was also 19. I'm not sure how age affects recidivism in this range, but generally, younger individuals might have a lower risk.\n\nEthnicity: She's Black, like Example 2. But Example 2 had no prior convictions and no drugs use. Here she has one arrest but not convicted. Maybe her race isn't the biggest factor here since she's young and without a conviction.\n\nNumber of arrests: She's been arrested once, same as Example 1, which didn't result in a conviction. So that might be low risk compared to someone with multiple arrests or prior convictions.\n\nDrug use: She hasn't used drugs for four years, unlike Examples 1 and 3 who used marijuana or both marijuana and cocaine. Her lack of drug use is a positive sign.\n\nMarital status: She's living with her biological mother alone. Example 2 was also single but had no prior convictions. Since she's never married and isn't living alone now, maybe that's not as much of a risk factor here.\n\nHighest education: She has a high school diploma, same as Examples 1 and 3. Education can correlate with lower recidivism, so this might be in her favor.\n\nNumber of jobs: She's held two jobs, whereas Example 2 had none. Having some employment history is generally better for avoiding recidivism.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month, unlike Examples 1 and 3 who did experience some low mood. Her mental stability could be beneficial.\n\nHousehold size at age of arrest: She was in a household with her biological mother when arrested. Example 2's household size was 5. Being raised in a stable environment might reduce risk factors.\n\nReligious belief: She believes God has something to do with her life, similar to Examples 1 and 3. Religious involvement can sometimes lead to better support systems or personal accountability, which might lower recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most of the factors here are favorable compared to previous cases. No prior convictions, low drug use, stable living situation, education, employment history, and positive mental health contribute to a lower risk. So I'd predict she has a lower chance of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"She is 20 years old, which is generally favorable for recidivism risk as younger individuals often have lower risk compared to older adults.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Being Black can be a factor in recidivism, but this case shows no prior convictions and positive factors that mitigate risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but not convicted, which is less than the examples provided and suggests potential low risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"She has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a strong indicator of lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother alone indicates stability compared to Examples 1 and 3 who were living with multiple family members but had no prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"Highest Education\", \"medium\", \"She has a high school diploma, which is consistent with previous examples but not as significant in reducing risk as higher education might be.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"high\", \"Holding two jobs indicates better employability and support system compared to Examples 1 (0) and 3 (4), which had fewer job experiences but no prior convictions for this case.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating good mental stability similar to previous examples who also reported positive mental health outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of Arrest\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household size 3 indicates a more stable environment compared to Example 2 (household size 5) which did not have prior convictions for this case.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Believing that God has something to do with her life, similar to previous examples but without specific instances of religious involvement leading to positive outcomes in the past.\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
