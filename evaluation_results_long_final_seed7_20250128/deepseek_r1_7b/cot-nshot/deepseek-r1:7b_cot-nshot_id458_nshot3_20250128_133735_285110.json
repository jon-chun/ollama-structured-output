    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female Hispanic. She's been arrested three times but not convicted. That seems like a high number of prior offenses, which usually increases the risk of recidivism.\n\nShe weighs 155 lbs and is 5'3\". Her weight isn't extreme, so maybe that factor doesn't play much role here.\n\nShe's divorced and living alone. Living situation can affect how stable she is, but since she's not in a relationship either, it might indicate some instability, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Completing high school or having some education is generally associated with lower recidivism, so maybe this is a low to medium factor.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment can help reduce recidivism, but holding only one job might mean she's underemployed or facing other challenges, which could be a medium risk.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a strong risk factor, so this would likely contribute to a high risk assessment.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area at age young, with five family members. Urban living can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or stressors, and a larger household might indicate more support but could also mean she's isolated from other family, which isn't clear here.\n\nHer belief that God has something to do with her personal events suggests she's religious, which is usually protective against recidivism, so this might be a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrests (high), living situation (living alone could be medium depending on support), education level (low risk but not the strongest indicator), job status (medium), drug use (high), and belief in God (low). So her overall risk seems to be leaning towards high, which would predict a YES outcome for recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested three times but not convicted, indicating a history of criminal behavior that can lead to recurrence.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"She is living alone after a divorce, which may indicate instability or lack of support which could influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a GED and is not enrolled in college, which generally correlates with lower recidivism risk as education can lead to better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"She held one job during the year; while this shows some stability, it may also indicate limited support or other challenges affecting her ability to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but has not felt depressed recently.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She is divorced and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
