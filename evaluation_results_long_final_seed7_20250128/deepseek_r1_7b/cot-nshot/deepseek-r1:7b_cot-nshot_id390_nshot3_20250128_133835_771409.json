    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case for a 22-year-old White male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he was arrested once and convicted. That's a clear recidivist history, which is high risk because prior convictions are strong indicators of future criminal behavior.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall weighing 160 lbs. While weight isn't directly a risk factor in recidivism, it's not particularly concerning here either.\n\n living alone: Being single can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to reduced supervision and support networks, so that might be medium or high depending on other factors.\n\nHigh school diploma but enrolled in college. Education typically is protective against rearrest, so this could lower the risk, maybe low impact.\n\nHeld 3 jobs during the year. Employment generally helps reduce recidivism because it provides stability and income, so this factor would have a mitigating effect, perhaps low to medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and had a bad mood recently. Drug abuse is a significant risk factor, especially if it's recent or severe, which makes this high risk.\n\nConsidering God has nothing to do with his life could imply a lack of religious support or spirituality, which some studies suggest might be associated with higher recidivism, so that's another medium-high factor.\n\nLived with both parents at age 7 in a household size of 4 in a rural area. Small households can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to less supervision and reliance on extended family, but it depends on other factors like support systems.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior conviction is high. Drug use and living situation are medium-high. Education and employment are protective. The lack of religious involvement could be medium. The small household size in a rural area might add another layer.\n\nSo the overall risk seems to lean towards high, but it's not entirely certain because education and stable employment play a role.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted once, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and increased likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Individual has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and reported feeling down recently, indicating potential substance abuse which can impair judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone is associated with higher risk of criminal behavior due to isolation and lack of supervision.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Individual has a high school diploma but is enrolled in college, which typically provides educational stability and opportunities that reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Individual held three jobs during the year, providing income stability and reducing dependence on substance abuse as a coping mechanism.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
