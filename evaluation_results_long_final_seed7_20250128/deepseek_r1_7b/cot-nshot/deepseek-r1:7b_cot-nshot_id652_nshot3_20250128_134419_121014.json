    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. First, let me list all the given factors for this person:\n\n- Age: 22-year-old male.\n- Hispanic identity.\n- Arrested once, not convicted.\n- Height: 6 feet 1 inch, weight between 150-174 lbs.\n- Never married, living alone.\n- High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n- Worked 2 jobs in the past year.\n- Drug use: marijuana in past four years, felt down recently.\n- Young household: lived with both parents in a household of size 5, urban area.\n- Believes God has no influence.\n\nNow, I'll compare this to the examples provided. \n\nIn Example 1 and 2, individuals who were not convicted had an outcome of NO. Here, our person was arrested once but not convicted, so it's similar. \n\nThe factors that increased recidivism in Examples where the outcome was YES included more prior convictions, living with parents (household size), drug use, and negative mood. \n\nLooking at this case:\n\n- No prior convictions: lower risk.\n- Lives alone: might indicate higher self-reliance, but living with parents could be a factor if it's a large household which sometimes is associated with instability.\n- Drug use: moderate risk.\n- Negative mood: significant risk.\n\nWeighting each factor:\n\n1. Age and education level (22, diploma): Low to medium. Being younger might mean less life experience, but a diploma can be stabilizing.\n2. Hispanic identity: Medium influence; race alone isn't the determining factor but could relate to systemic issues.\n3. Arrests: No conviction: Low risk as no prior offense.\n4. Weight and height: Within normal range, so low.\n5. Living situation: Alone is good, but living with parents in urban area might be a slight concern if household size affects stability (medium).\n6. Drug use: Medium to high. Previous Examples 3 had moderate drug use leading to YES.\n7. Mood: High risk as it's a significant factor seen in Example 3.\n8. Household background: Urban, but in Example 3, rural was protective; living with parents might be less so (medium).\n9. Belief in God: Low influence unless it affects other factors like stress.\n\nPutting this together, the higher risk factors are mood and drug use, which could push the prediction towards YES despite some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 22 years old, which may indicate lower life experience but could be stabilizing due to education and work history.\"),\n    (\"Hispanic Identity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic identity can be a factor in recidivism risk assessments but does not alone determine it.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"The individual has one arrest but no prior convictions, which may indicate less recidivistic tendencies.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"The person is 6 feet 1 inch tall and weighs between 150-174 lbs, which falls within a healthy range.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may provide some stability, but living with both parents in an urban area could introduce potential instability factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"The individual has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which provides some educational stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"The person has held two jobs in the past year, indicating some work experience that may contribute to financial stability.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium-high\", \"The individual has used marijuana in the past four years and felt down recently, which could be significant risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mood/Emotional State\", \"high\", \"The person experienced significant mood issues in the past month, which can exacerbate existing stressors and potential triggers for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Background/Living Conditions\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in an urban area could introduce social or environmental factors that may contribute to instability or stress but is not as directly protective as rural living conditions as seen in Example 3.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"The individual does not consider God to be involved in their personal events, which may reduce the perceived influence of systemic risk factors related to religion.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
