    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a Black male, 22 years old. He's been arrested once but not convicted. His weight is in the higher end of his range\u2014200-224 lbs, which might indicate he's at or near his healthy weight. He's living alone with his mother since he was young, so that's a family history of recidivism as seen in Examples 1 and 3.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Maybe not finishing school could contribute to future issues, though it's not the most significant factor here.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year, which is positive\u2014more stable income can reduce recidivism. However, he uses marijuana, which might affect his judgment or health.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, so that's a good sign. Not feeling down could mean better coping mechanisms.\n\nFamily background: Growing up in a household of five with his mom in an urban area (Example 2 had a similar setup). Urban environments can have higher crime rates and poorer conditions. The fact that he has both parents living at a young age might offer some protective factors, but it's not as strong as being in a larger family.\n\nHis belief in God is mentioned as something unrelated to his personal experiences\u2014similar to Example 2, where lack of spiritual connection was noted. That might suggest he doesn't get support from religion during tough times.\n\nPutting this together: The key risk factors here are the family history ( living with mother in a large household and rural setting?), but wait, no, it's urban area. His past drug use is a concern, though he hasn't been convicted yet. He has two jobs which is good. No recent depression, so that's positive.\n\nComparing to previous examples: Example 1 had similar factors except for race and living situation, outcome was NO. Example 2 had no prior convictions, living alone, but family size 5 in urban area\u2014outcome was also NO. Example 3 had more arrests without convictions, higher weight, lived alone with parents in rural area, used drugs and was depressed\u2014outcome YES.\n\nSo this case has fewer recidivism factors: no prior conviction, two jobs, no drug use (except marijuana), no recent depression, living with mother in urban area\u2014but being Black might increase risk. The family size is similar to Example 2 but in an urban setting, which could be worse than rural areas seen in Example 3.\n\nHis belief in God doesn't add much here since he's not experiencing issues related to it. So overall, the risk factors lean towards a NO outcome, with maybe some high factors like past family living conditions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"The individual has only been arrested once but hasn't been convicted, which is less than the recidivism rate seen in similar cases where multiple arrests occur without convictions.\"),\n    (\"Family History of Recidivism\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area presents some risk factors, though not as significant as larger family sizes or rural living conditions seen in previous examples like Example 3.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college may offer some protection compared to those without any education, but it's not a strong mitigating factor here.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding two jobs during the year reduces recidivism risk compared to those with no employment or fewer stable positions, as seen in Example 3 where individuals held no jobs had higher rearrest rates over three years.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"While he has used marijuana in the past four years, not using drugs for an extended period and being employed may indicate a lower risk of substance abuse issues contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently suggests better coping mechanisms and support systems compared to previous examples where depression was noted as a risk factor leading to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Considering that God has something to do with his personal experiences indicates a potential lack of spiritual or religious support during stressful times, which may not be a strong risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation and Family Size\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of size 5 is similar to Example 2 but slightly higher risk than rural living areas seen in previous examples like Example 3.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
