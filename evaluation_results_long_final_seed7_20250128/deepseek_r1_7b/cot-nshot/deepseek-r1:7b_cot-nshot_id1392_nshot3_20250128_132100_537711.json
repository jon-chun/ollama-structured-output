Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's definitely high risk because prior convictions are strong indicators of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and weighs 155 lbs. Weight isn't typically a big factor unless it's extreme, so that might be low.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014unemployment can lead to higher recidivism, but being single itself is neutral without other info.\n\nEnrolled in school: Education usually reduces risk, especially if he's attending, which would lower the chance of reoffending. So maybe medium.\n\n Held 3 jobs: Having a stable job history lowers risk because it shows he has skills and can support himself. That could be high or medium depending on the context. Since he's not in school anymore, maybe medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana but hasn't used others recently. Past drug use is low to moderate risk unless it's recent or severe. Here, it's just marijuana, so perhaps medium.\n\nMental health: He felt down for much of the month. High risk because mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior and relapse after release.\n\nHousehold size at 2 in a rural area\u2014small household might mean less supervision but could also indicate he's living independently. Not sure how much this affects risk, so maybe low.\n\nGod involvement: He believes God is involved, which is usually protective unless there's evidence of sin. So that would be low to neutral.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), unemployment (low), education (medium), job history (medium), drug use (medium), mental health (high), household size (low), and God involvement (low). The high factors are prior arrest, mental health issues, and maybe lack of supervision. The medium ones include education, job history, and drug use.\n\nSo the overall risk is probably medium to high because he has some high-risk factors that aren't canceled out by strong protective ones. Considering the prior conviction and mental health issues, I'd lean towards a YES for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted once, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and increased likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Currently enrolled in school suggests he may be motivated to avoid criminal activity through education and personal responsibility.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"medium\", \"He has felt down for much of the month, which can affect decision-making and impulse control, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"He has only used marijuana recently, indicating occasional use rather than frequent or severe substance abuse that could predict recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size\", \"low\", \"Living alone in a small household may imply less supervision but also independence, which can be associated with higher risk if unstable circumstances persist.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
