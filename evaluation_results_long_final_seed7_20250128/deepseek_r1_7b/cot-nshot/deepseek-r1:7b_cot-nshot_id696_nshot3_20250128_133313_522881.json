    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help this user by analyzing a risk assessment case based on the examples provided. Let's start by understanding what they're asking for.\n\nFirst, they've given three example cases with specific risk factors and outcomes over three years. Each factor is listed as a risk indicator, and the outcome is either YES or NO for recidivism. My task is to apply this analysis to a new case of an 18-year-old White female.\n\nI should break down each factor in the new case against the examples to assign weights\u2014low, medium, or high. The factors are: age, race, prior convictions, BMI, marital status, education level, job experience, drug use, household size and location, and religious beliefs.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n- In Example #1, being Hispanic with multiple prior arrests led to NO recidivism.\n- Example #2 for Black individuals without prior convictions also resulted in NO.\n- Example #3 had White with multiple arrests leading to YES.\n\nNow, analyzing the new case: She's 18, White, arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because Example 1 has similar age but with more factors leading to NO. Her BMI is low; Examples don't have this factor yet, so maybe it doesn't impact much here.\n\nShe's living alone, which in Example #2 was also the case (Black female), but she didn't recidivate. Marital status: never married\u2014similar to Example 2, no prior issues. Education-wise, she's at a 4-year college; previous examples don't have this, so maybe it's positive.\n\nShe held three jobs, which is better than not holding any in Examples 1 and 2 but similar to some factors there. Drug use: only marijuana in the past four years\u2014it\u2019s less severe than Examples where she used more drugs (Examples 3 had cocaine). Her emotional state during the past month is low\u2014similar to Example 2, which also had no depression.\n\nHousehold size was 4 at a rural area. In Example #1, household size was higher but led to NO. The religion factor: God has nothing to do with her\u2014it\u2019s neutral or perhaps protective if it's a significant factor elsewhere.\n\nPutting this together:\n- Prior conviction is high risk\u2014she has one.\n- Drug use is low but not severe.\n- Age and living situation are mixed, but her education level might mitigate risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, she seems at medium to low risk of recidivism. The prior conviction is a strong indicator for YES, but other mitigating factors like education and no major drug issues could lower it. Since the examples don't heavily penalize educational attainment or positive living situations, I'll lean towards NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted for a prior offense which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age is not typically considered a direct risk factor, but being 18 years old may indicate a shorter time in the workforce and potentially less established habits.\"),\n    (\"bmi\", \"low\", \"The individual's BMI is at the lower end, which may correlate with better physical health, though this is not directly related to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not necessarily indicate a higher risk of recidivism, as seen in similar cases where individuals lived alone and did not recidivate.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Enrolled in a 4-year college may provide some mitigating factors such as ongoing learning and potential career stability, but it is not directly linked to recidivism in these examples.\"),\n    (\"job_experience\", \"low\", \"Having held three jobs during the year indicates stable employment history, which is generally protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \" drug use in the past four years (marijuana) with no major substance abuse issues over the past month does not indicate a high risk of relapse or recidivism.\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"low\", \"Feeling down and without experiencing depression over the past month may reduce stress levels, which can positively impact behavior and likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4 at a rural area does not directly correlate with recidivism but may indicate a more stable environment compared to larger households as seen in Example #1.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Considering that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally is neutral, though religious factors are not always directly linked to recidivism in these examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 106 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
