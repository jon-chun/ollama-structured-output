    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the risk factors for this new case based on the examples provided. Let me start by reviewing each example carefully.\n\nIn Example #1, a 21-year-old Hispanic male with one prior arrest, not convicted, no drugs, living with spouse, high school diploma, four jobs, and a large household\u2014all these factors contributed to NO rearrest. The person was stable in his environment and had positive mental health.\n\nExample #2 is similar but for a Black male without a prior conviction, living alone, no education or jobs, also NO rearrest. Again, stability and lack of significant issues played a role.\n\nIn Example #3, factors like prior arrests (though not convicted), drug use, negative mood, and living with parents in a rural area led to YES rearrest. This suggests higher risk when there are more negatives like drug use or unstable family environments.\n\nNow looking at the case I need to evaluate: 22-year-old White male, 2 prior arrests and a conviction, height and weight, living alone, GED, three jobs, past drug use (marijuana and cocaine), positive mental health, lived with parents in urban area, no religious impact.\n\nFirst, prior convictions: high risk as they have a history. Next, negative factors like drug use\u2014high risk because even if not convicted, past use can affect recidivism. Positive factors include GED, job stability, good mental health, living alone which might indicate less support and higher risk despite that. The urban area could mean more stressors.\n\nConsidering the examples, prior convictions are a strong indicator of high risk. Drug use here is also present but without conviction\u2014so maybe lower than someone with prior convictions. However, it's still concerning.\n\nThe person lives alone, which in Example #2 was NO, but Example #3 had living with parents and that led to YES. So being alone might mitigate some factors but not all.\n\nGED could be a positive as education sometimes helps, but having three jobs is also positive compared to lower job stability.\n\nPositive mental health (no depression) is good but doesn't negate other negative risk factors like drug use or prior arrests.\n\nOverall, the person has some mitigating factors but also significant risk points. Prior convictions and drug use are strong indicators here. I'm leaning towards a high confidence of YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has two prior arrests and one conviction, indicating a history of criminal behavior which significantly increases the likelihood of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
