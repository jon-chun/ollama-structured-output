    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the risk factors provided. Let me start by breaking down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19 years old. Young adults are generally considered high-risk because they're still developing their skills and can make impulsive decisions. So that's a high risk.\n\nHe has been arrested 4 times but not convicted. Re-arrests without a conviction often mean he's trying to avoid legal trouble again, which could indicate he might be at higher risk of reoffending if he fails this time.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches and weight 145 lbs. Not sure how relevant that is, but maybe relates to substance use or physical health? Not a strong indicator though.\n\nMarital status: He's never been married and living alone. Living in a single household might mean he has fewer social support networks, which could increase risk of recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Education level can correlate with lower recidivism because people with higher education are more likely to get jobs and support themselves. So this is a medium-high risk factor.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs during the year. Having stable employment usually reduces the likelihood of becoming a risk. Four jobs might suggest some financial stability, but if he lost them due to arrest, maybe not as strong a positive. I'd say medium-low risk here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a major predictor of recidivism because it can lead to health issues, legal problems, and unstable living situations. That's definitely high risk.\n\nHe felt down for some time during the month, which might relate to substance abuse or mental health issues. That could be another medium-high risk factor as depression or anxiety often accompanies drug use.\n\nHousehold size at age: He lived with his biological dad in a household of 4. Smaller households can offer more support, but being part of a larger family might mean he's less involved in the family dynamics that could either protect or put him at risk. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nLocation is urban area, which doesn't directly affect risk factors but might influence access to resources or community support indirectly.\n\nBelief in God: He says God has something to do with his life. A strong moral support can be protective, so maybe lower risk. But that's a personal factor and could vary.\n\nPutting it all together: The person is 19, has multiple arrest convictions (not held), no diploma, uses drugs, feels down, lives alone in an urban area without much family support. These factors point towards high recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The person is 19 years old, which makes them a high-risk individual as they are still developing their skills and may make impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested 4 times but not convicted, indicating he may attempt to avoid legal trouble again, increasing his risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Situation\", \"medium-high\", \"Living alone and never being married can reduce social support networks, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He has no high school diploma or GED, which may correlate with lower chances of finding stable employment and support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium-low\", \"Held 4 jobs during the year; stable employment can reduce recidivism risk, but if lost due to arrest, may not be as strong a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a significant predictor of recidivism due to potential health issues and legal problems.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health/Feeling Down\", \"medium-high\", \"Felt down for some time during the month, potentially indicating underlying mental health issues that could contribute to risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Dynamics/Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Lived with his biological dad in a household of 4; while this may offer support, larger households can sometimes be less involved in family dynamics that might either protect or put him at risk.\"),\n    (\"Location\", \"low\", \"Resides in an urban area; urban environments can provide more resources and community support compared to rural areas but not directly affecting risk factors here.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God/Morality\", \"low\", \"Believes God has something to do with his life, which could be protective as strong moral support can offer protection from negative influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White.
