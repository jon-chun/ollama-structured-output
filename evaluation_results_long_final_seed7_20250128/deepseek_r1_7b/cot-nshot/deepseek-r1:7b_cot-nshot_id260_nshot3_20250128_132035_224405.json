    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Black male, not convicted yet but arrested once. That's one point to consider\u2014he has a prior arrest which might indicate past behavior issues.\n\nHe weighs 180 lbs and is 5'8\". Not sure how height affects risk here, maybe just noting he's fit or maybe not.\n\nLiving alone\u2014so no support system, could be a risk factor for substance abuse or other issues.\n\nEnrolled in school: Education is often a positive factor. Being in school might indicate better job opportunities and self-discipline.\n\nHe held one job during the year\u2014he has some work experience which is good, but maybe not enough to prevent rearrest if he's struggling.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana past four years, so he's using drugs, which can lead to problems like unemployment or being unable to find better jobs. Plus, he felt extremely down for most of the month, which might be related to drug use and could affect his ability to get back on track.\n\nAt a young age, lived with biological mother in a household of three in an urban area\u2014maybe living in a larger household can sometimes mean more stress or less supervision, but it's also urban, which might have better resources for help.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014so he's religious. Religious factors are usually protective because they often provide support and guidance.\n\nPutting this all together: He has some positive factors like being in school and having a job, but significant negatives like prior arrest, drug use, living alone, and current negative mood. The prior arrest is a red flag even if not convicted. Drug use can lead to more issues, especially with mental health affecting his ability to work or stay stable.\n\nHis being Black might be a factor depending on any racial disparities in the system, but I don't have specific data here so I'll treat it as neutral unless other factors suggest otherwise.\n\nThe job held during the year\u2014he only had one. If he's not making much money and struggling financially, that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nLiving alone can lead to isolation, which might exacerbate existing issues like drug use or lack of support.\n\nHis mood seems very low for a month\u2014this could be due to multiple factors but also could indicate he's dealing with substance abuse or other stressors. It\u2019s concerning because being in such a low mood can affect his ability to seek help or manage daily tasks, which might lead him back into trouble.\n\nConsidering all these points, the risk seems moderately high. He has some mitigating factors like education and being enrolled in school but also significant issues like prior arrest, drug use, living situation, and current emotional state. The combination of these makes me lean towards a YES outcome for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a prior arrest history which can be an indicator of past behavioral issues that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse, particularly marijuana use in the past four years, is a significant risk factor as it can lead to further instability and involvement in illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"single_resident\", \"medium\", \"Living alone increases the likelihood of isolation and potential issues such as drug use or lack of support, which could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"job held\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the year may indicate limited economic stability but does not directly correlate with a high risk of rearrest if other factors are controlled for.\"),\n    (\"negative_mood\", \"high\", \"Sustained negative mood over the past month is concerning and may indicate underlying issues such as substance abuse or mental health challenges that could impact reintegration efforts and future stability.\"),\n    (\"residential_stability\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a household of three in an urban area, while potentially providing some support, does not inherently guarantee residential stability but also doesn't contribute directly to high risk without additional factors like drug use or family dysfunction.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with one's life is generally protective as religious beliefs often provide guidance and support which can aid in reintegration efforts.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
