    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the examples provided. Let me start by going through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who's Black. She's been arrested once and convicted. That seems like a significant risk factor because having a prior conviction can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So, that's probably high risk.\n\nShe weighs 172 lbs at 5 feet 2 inches. Not sure if weight is a big factor here unless it's related to substance use, but she hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so maybe not much issue there.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Single individuals might have different support networks, which could either help or hurt. Since she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, that academic progress can be positive, reducing recidivism chances. But her job history shows she held 3 jobs during the year, which suggests she's been employed enough to support herself, so maybe not as big a risk.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed over the past month, so mental health isn't an issue here. Her household at a young age was size 3 in a rural area with her biological mother. Being raised in a stable environment is good for behavior and adjustment, but she's now 20, which gives her more life experience.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the prior arrest and conviction are strong indicators of high risk. The other factors seem to be positive, so I'm leaning towards a YES outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_convicted\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested once and has been convicted, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age_and_gender\", \"low\", \"She is 20 years old and female, which generally indicates a lower risk compared to younger males in similar situations.\"),\n    (\"weight_and_height\", \"low\", \"Her weight (172 lbs) and height (5ft2\") are within a healthy range and do not indicate substance use issues based on the provided data.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors, but she is not currently in a relationship or married.\"),\n    (\"education_and_college\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests good academic progress and support for her independence.\"),\n    (\"job_experience\", \"medium\", \"Holding 3 jobs during the year indicates some level of stability, but this also shows she has faced challenges to maintain employment over time.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating good mental health and a stable emotional state.\"),\n    (\"household_environment_youth\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of size 3 in a rural area suggests a stable early life experience, which can be beneficial for recidivism risk but does not fully indicate stability throughout her life.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 172 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
