    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down this case step by step. The person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male with several risk factors we need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, his criminal history: He has one arrest but no conviction, which might indicate he's not yet fully involved in the legal system. This could be low risk because lack of convictions can sometimes show maturity or potential for positive change.\n\nHis weight and height don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll consider them as low factors.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, which is typical and doesn't necessarily indicate high risk. No children in the household either, so that's another low factor.\n\nEducation-wise, he lacks a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Without formal education, maybe he has limited opportunities for positive involvement, making this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's employed three jobs during the year, which is good because consistent work can help with financial stability and reducing stress, so that might be low risk.\n\nDrug use: He uses marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. While drug use can be a red flag, especially if it leads to negative emotions, in this case, he's not experiencing depression, which might lower the risk slightly\u2014maybe medium.\n\nLiving with his biological mother alone at a young age could have some stressors, but since he's an adult now and living independently, that factor is probably low.\n\nHis belief in God influencing his personal matters is a positive sign, indicating he might seek support or maintain a structured life through spirituality. That's likely to be high risk because it can provide a sense of guidance and reduce negative behaviors.\n\nPutting all this together: The lack of education and drug use without depression are medium factors, but the belief in God as a strong influence is high. While not impossible, the positive factor leans towards lower recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"The person has one arrest but no conviction, which may indicate a potential for positive change and less involvement in the criminal system.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"He weighs 199 lbs at 5 feet 9 inches; however, weight itself does not directly correlate with recidivism unless associated with other factors like substance use or living conditions.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"He is currently living alone without a spouse, which is a common situation and may not necessarily indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"household size at young age\", \"low\", \"At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5; however, since he is an adult now and living independently, this factor may have less impact.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, which could limit opportunities for positive involvement and support.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"He has held 3 jobs during the year; employment can contribute to financial stability and reduce stress, indicating low risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana but has not felt depressed over the past month; drug use alone does not necessarily indicate high risk without additional negative behavioral signs like depression or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"family history at young age\", \"low\", \"At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a rural area; however, since he is an adult now and living independently, this factor may have less impact than it would for someone younger.\"),\n    (\"spiritual belief\", \"high\", \"He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally; this strong spiritual belief can provide guidance and reduce negative behaviors associated with religion denial or lack of faith in supportive systems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
