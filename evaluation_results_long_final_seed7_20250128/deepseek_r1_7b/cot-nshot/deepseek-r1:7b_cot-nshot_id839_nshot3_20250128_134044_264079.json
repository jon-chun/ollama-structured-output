    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 20-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a White male, which in some studies shows a slight underrepresentation in convictions compared to Black and Hispanic individuals with similar offenses. But since he was convicted once, it's a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe has one prior arrest and one conviction. Having a conviction definitely increases the chance of rearrest, so that's a high risk factor.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight between 150-174 lbs. Weight in this range might indicate some underweight issues or maybe he's muscular. Not sure if BMI plays a role here, but it's not an immediate red flag for recidivism.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone. Living with someone can provide emotional support and stability, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nHigh school diploma means he didn't complete college, which might affect his job prospects or ability to get support. But this alone doesn't directly correlate with rearrest rates as much as other factors like substance use.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to increased stress and substance abuse, so that's a medium risk factor contributing to potential issues.\n\nDrug use includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, along with feelings of depression. Substance abuse is strongly linked to recidivism because it can impede job prospects and increase criminal tendencies. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Living in a larger household might mean less supervision or more exposure to negative influences, so that's another high risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which can affect his motivation and decision-making regarding substance use and criminal behavior. This is a low risk factor because lack of religious support isn't necessarily correlated with higher recidivism rates unless it affects other aspects like self-control.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction (high), drug use (high), living situation (high). These factors are significantly increasing his risk, so I'd predict he has a high chance of rearrest. Therefore, the outcome is \"YES\".\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior conviction for a similar offense which can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior and re-arrest.\"),\n    (\"drugUse\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine) along with feelings of depression significantly contribute to increased risk of recidivism as these factors can lead to poor decision-making and impede job prospects which may lead to further involvement in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"familyEnvironment\", \"high\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of 4 in a rural area at a young age could indicate potential exposure to negative influences or unstable family dynamics, increasing the risk of engaging in risky behaviors and re-offending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
