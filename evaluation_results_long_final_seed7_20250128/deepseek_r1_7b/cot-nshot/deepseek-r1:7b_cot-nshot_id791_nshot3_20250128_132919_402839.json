    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the given examples. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me look at Example #3 since the outcome was YES there. The person had multiple factors contributing to a higher risk. Now, in the current case, here are the factors:\n\n1. Age: 21 years old, which is similar to Example #3 where the person was 19 but White. Younger individuals might have more impulsive behavior.\n   \n2. Hispanic vs. White: The example had a Hispanic male with high risk, while our case is White female. Generally, race can influence recidivism rates based on systemic issues and stereotypes.\n\n3. Number of arrests: She's been arrested twice and convicted, which is higher than the previous examples where she was only arrested once or not convicted. More arrests usually correlate with higher risk.\n\n4. Weight and height: 120 lbs at 5'2\". The examples had males who were either lighter (135 lbs) or heavier (190 lbs). Her size might affect her stability if it's a significant issue, but it's not directly tied to the examples.\n\n5. Marital status: She's married and living with her spouse. This is different from Example #2 where she was single and living alone. Living with family can provide support and reduce risk factors.\n\n6. Education level: No high school diploma or GED. Similar to previous cases, which had either no diploma or a diploma but not enrolled in college. This is a strong risk factor as per the examples.\n\n7. Employment history: She's held no jobs during the year. The previous cases all had job experience, so this is a significant red flag, indicating possible instability and higher likelihood of returning to criminal behavior.\n\n8. Drug use: She's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. This is concerning because continued substance use can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing recidivism chances.\n\n9. Past household size at young age: She lived with both parents in a household of 5 in a rural area. Larger households might provide more support but could also be isolating if family members aren't supportive. The rural setting adds another layer; rural areas often have higher crime rates and less resources for support, which can increase risk.\n\n10. Belief in God: She believes God has something to do with her life. This is interesting because religion can sometimes correlate with better outcomes due to community support or moral guidance, but it's not always the case. Her positive belief might offset some negative factors, but given her other high-risk traits, she might still be at risk.\n\nPutting this all together: She has multiple high-risk factors like prior convictions, lack of education, no job history, drug use, and living in a larger household in a rural area. These are similar to the risk factors in Example #3 which resulted in a YES outcome. Even though her age is 21 (a bit higher), her other factors weigh more heavily.\n\nI think her risk score would be high because she has several points that indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism within three years. The positive belief in God might not fully mitigate these risks, especially considering the other significant factors like drug use and past criminal history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may contribute to impulsive behavior commonly associated with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Being White does not inherently increase risk compared to other examples but could be influenced by systemic factors related to race and law enforcement\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and a conviction, indicating past criminal history which is typically associated with increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Weight/Height\", \"low\", \"She weighs 120 lbs at 5'2'', but height alone does not directly correlate with recidivism unless combined with other factors like substance use or instability\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living with a spouse provides support, which can reduce risk factors compared to living alone as in previous examples\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED, similar to previous cases where lack of education was a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year, contributing to instability often linked with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in past four years without recent feelings of depression; substance use can impair judgment and decision-making\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age\", \"high\", \"Lived with both parents in a household of 5, which may indicate less family support or living in a rural area where resources are limited and crime rates are higher\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Positive belief in God can sometimes offer moral support but does not fully offset other high-risk factors like substance use or criminal history\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
