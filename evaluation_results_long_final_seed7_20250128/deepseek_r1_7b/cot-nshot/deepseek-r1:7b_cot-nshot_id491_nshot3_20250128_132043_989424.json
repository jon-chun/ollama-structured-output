    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the given examples. Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the provided examples to understand how risk factors contribute to rearrest outcomes. There are three examples here:\n\nExample 1: A 21-year-old Hispanic male with no prior convictions, some drug use history, living with his spouse, and a high school diploma. His outcome was NO rearrest.\n\nExample 2: A 19-year-old Black male without a prior conviction, no jobs, no drug issues, living alone, and negative feelings about God. Also NO rearrest.\n\nExample 3: A 19-year-old White male with three arrests but not convicted, some drug use, negative mood, living with parents in rural area. Outcome was YES rearrest.\n\nNow, the case to predict is a 20-year-old White male arrested once without conviction. He's taller than average, living alone, no job, no drugs, and his early life was with his dad in a small rural household.\n\nI need to assign weights (low, medium, high) to each risk factor from Examples 1-3, then use them to predict the outcome.\n\nFirst, I'll list all relevant factors for this case:\n\n- Age: 20. In Example 1 and 2, similar ages but not directly compared here.\n- Hispanic vs White: The person is White in our case, while Example 3 was also White with three arrests leading to YES. So being White might be a low risk factor unless other factors change it.\n\nRisk Factors:\n\n1. Age at first arrest (20): In the examples, younger individuals sometimes had different outcomes. But since none of Examples 1-3 have this age, I'll consider it as no specific impact yet.\n\n2. Hispanic origin: White in our case\u2014might be low risk unless other factors negate it.\n\n3. Number of prior arrests: 1. Example 3 had three, leading to YES; but one arrest is lower, so perhaps medium or low.\n\n4. Drug use history: None in this case. Examples 1 and 2 have some drug issues, which might be mitigating here\u2014so low impact.\n\n5. Marital status: Living alone. Example 2 was living alone and had NO, while Example 3's outcome was YES despite not being married. So being single is a mixed factor but seems protective.\n\n6. Education level: No diploma/GED. In Example 1, he had one, which didn't lead to rearrest. Here, no education\u2014could be high risk if other factors don't balance it.\n\n7. Number of jobs: 1 job here vs. Example 3's 4 jobs, but our case is lower job stability, so maybe medium risk.\n\n8. Religiosity: No mention in the case; unlike Example 2 where he didn't believe in God and had NO. Here, no info on this factor\u2014probably neutral or low impact as it's not a given.\n\n9. household size at arrest: 4 in rural area. In Example 3, it was 3 in rural leading to YES. Our case is larger household but same rural setting\u2014maybe mitigating?\n\n10. Previous negative feelings about God: Not applicable here since no info on this factor for the current case.\n\nPutting weights:\n\n- Prior arrests (1): Medium risk because higher numbers in Example 3 led to YES, but one arrest might be lower.\n- Drug use: Low risk as none present\u2014mitigates rearrest.\n- Marital status (living alone): Medium; being single can reduce risk if other factors are stable.\n- Education level: High risk due to lack of education and no diploma in Example 1 didn't help, but here it's more about no help at all.\n- Number of jobs: Medium\u2014having some work might indicate stability, but only one job is lower than four in Example 3.\n\nCombining these, the high risk factors (education level) could dominate. So even with medium weights on some positive factors like living alone and no arrests, the lack of education might push the outcome towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having one prior arrest without a conviction can increase risk compared to higher numbers in similar examples but is mitigated by other factors like living situation and education level.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use history reduces risk compared to examples with similar issues.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone, while protective, might not be sufficient if other risk factors are present such as lack of education.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma/GED can significantly increase rearrest risk, especially when compared to examples with higher education and fewer issues.\"),\n    (\"number_of_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Having one job might indicate some stability but is less than the four in similar examples leading to higher rearrest rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
