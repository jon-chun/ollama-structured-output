    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this new case based on the provided examples. Let me start by listing all the risk factors given.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male of Black identification. He's been arrested once but not convicted. His weight is between 200 and 224 lbs, which might indicate he hasn't had much trouble with substance use yet. He's living alone now after never being married. He's enrolled in school, so maybe has educational goals. No job experience for the past year, possibly due to studies or unemployment. No drug use in the past four years and no depression symptoms over the last month\u2014this is a positive sign.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. That might suggest some family stability but could also imply potential issues if there were disciplinary actions from the court or elsewhere. His belief that God has nothing to do with his personal events shows he's more self-reliant, which is generally associated with lower recidivism risk.\n\nComparing this case to the examples: Example #1 had a Hispanic male who didn't reoffend (Outcome NO). Example #2 was Black, not convicted, and also didn't reoffend. Example #3 was White, had more prior arrests, used drugs, and had higher depression symptoms\u2014ended up with a YES.\n\nIn this new case, the person is younger than the previous examples but shares some factors like age, prior arrest (though not convictions), no drug use, no recent depression, living alone, enrolled in school. These are favorable signs, similar to Example #2 which also had NO outcome.\n\nHowever, being Black might place him at a slightly higher risk compared to White or Hispanic individuals based on recidivism statistics, but the other factors here could lower that risk enough to predict NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 18 years old, which is a favorable factor for reduced recidivism risk compared to older individuals who may face more life challenges and opportunities for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic origin might have some association with higher recidivism rates, but this case shows he has no prior convictions, which mitigates that risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"He was arrested once but not convicted, which is a positive indicator of potential willingness to change and comply with laws.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"medium\", \"His weight falls in the middle range, suggesting he hasn't faced significant issues with substance abuse that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"He is living alone after never being married, which indicates a stable environment where he can focus on positive life choices and responsibilities.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He is enrolled in school, indicating an active pursuit of personal development and possibly better job opportunities that could reduce reoffending risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"He has held no jobs during the past year, which might indicate lack of economic dependency or motivation for criminal behavior, but his education level may compensate for this factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"He has not used any drugs in the past four years, showing a clean slate and reduced risk factors associated with substance abuse that can lead to reoffending.\",\n     \"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, which is favorable as mental health issues are often precursors to criminal behavior and its recurrence.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"His early life was in a household of three with his biological mother in an urban setting.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
