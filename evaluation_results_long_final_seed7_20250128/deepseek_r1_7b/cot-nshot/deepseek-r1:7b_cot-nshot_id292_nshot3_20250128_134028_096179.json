    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this query where the user is asking for a risk assessment analysis. They provided three example cases with specific risk factors and their corresponding outcomes over three years. Now they're presenting a new case of a 21-year-old Black female and want me to assign weights to each factor.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze each factor from the examples. For instance, in Example #3, having been arrested multiple times without conviction was associated with a higher recidivism rate. Similarly, factors like living alone were protective in some cases but not always. The user wants this new case's outcome predicted based on weighted risk factors.\n\nI should consider each factor one by one:\n\n1. Age: She's 21, which is younger than the previous examples (19 and 19). Generally, younger individuals might have lower recidivism rates.\n   \n2. Hispanic vs. Other: Her identity is White, but in Example #3 it was White with a higher rate. This might be a protective factor since being White had a low outcome.\n\n3. Number of arrests: She has one arrest, same as Examples 1 and 2, which didn't lead to a conviction. That's neutral.\n\n4. Height and Weight: Within the normal range; no previous examples have extreme values here.\n\n5. Marital status: Living alone in all three cases except Example #3 where she was with parents but it had a high outcome. Living alone might be protective against recidivism, so this could be a low risk factor.\n\n6. Education level: High school diploma, same as the Black female in Example 2 who had no arrest and a low outcome.\n\n7. Employment history: She's held two jobs; higher than Examples 1 (4) but lower than Example 3 (4). More stable employment might reduce recidivism.\n\n8. Drug use: She used marijuana weekly, same as the Black male in Example 2 who had no arrest and a low outcome. However, being Black in an urban area might have different implications here due to systemic issues not mentioned yet.\n\n9. Emotional state: She feels very down every month; this is more severe than Examples where she felt depressed but not necessarily as much. This could be a high risk factor indicating significant mental distress, which can influence recidivism.\n\n10. Household size and living situation: Living with her mother in a household of five urban setting. In Example 2, Black female alone had no issues, but this case has similar factors except for the emotional state.\n\n11. Belief in God: She believes in God, which is protective against recidivism as per some examples where belief was present (Examples 1 and 3) and low outcome.\n\nNow, considering all these, I need to assign weights. Emotional state seems high because it's a significant factor influencing behavior. Drug use could be medium due to weekly use but not heavy. Living situation is neutral or low since she's alone in most cases except with parents. Age has no direct weight as per examples.\n\nPutting this together, the emotional distress and drug use might tip towards a higher risk of recidivism despite being Black and having a clean arrest record. So, I'll predict \"YES\" but be cautious due to some protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"She is 21 years old, which may correlate with lower recidivism risk compared to the older individuals in the examples.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity (White)\", \"medium\", \"Being White was associated with a low outcome in Example #3, but this case does not include prior convictions, which could influence the risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"neutral\", \"One arrest without a conviction is neutral compared to the previous examples where there were no arrests or one conviction.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"She is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs, which aligns with typical adult heights and weights and does not indicate any health risks that could lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status (Living Alone)\", \"neutral\", \"Living alone is neutral in terms of risk as it was also a factor in the previous examples where outcomes varied based on other factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (High School Diploma)\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma, which aligns with educational stability and lower recidivism risk compared to those without education or with more recent convictions.\"),\n    (\"Employment History (2 Jobs)\", \"neutral\", \"Holding 2 jobs is neutral as it was also the case in other examples where outcomes varied based on additional factors like drug use or emotional distress.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana weekly could be a moderate risk factor, but the frequency and context of use do not necessarily correlate with higher recidivism rates without prior convictions or more severe drug use patterns.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State (Feeling Down Daily)\", \"high\", \"Suffering from significant emotional distress on a daily basis is a high-risk factor that could influence future criminal behavior and recidivism outcomes, even if other factors are mitigating.\",\n    (\"Household Size and Living Situation (Living Alone in Urban Area with Biological Mother)\", \"neutral\", \"Living alone does not inherently correlate with higher or lower risk without additional factors like emotional distress or substance use.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
