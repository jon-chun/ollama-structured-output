I'm an experienced criminal justice expert with a solid understanding of recidivism factors.\n\nFirst, the individual is an 18-year-old White female. She has a significant arrest history\u20143 convictions\u2014and her weight is 220 lbs. That heavy body weight could be a red flag due to potential substance abuse or past trauma, especially given her drug use history.\n\nShe's never married and living alone, which might indicate instability. Her educational status is enrolled in school, which is positive as education can lead to better job opportunities reducing future criminal behavior. However, she held only 1 job during the year, which isn't bad but maybe not enough considering her past.\n\nHer drug use includes marijuana and cocaine, showing ongoing substance issues that could affect her stability and ability to function. Her lack of depression in the past month is a positive sign as chronic depression can be a risk factor for further issues.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of 7 in an urban area at age young. High household size often correlates with more stress, substance abuse, or neglect, which could contribute to her recidivism.\n\nConsidering God involvement\u2014she believes it's important\u2014but without evidence of spiritual intervention against criminal behavior, this might not directly impact her risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Heavy weight, multiple arrests, drug use, living alone, and a high household size. These factors lean towards a higher risk despite her education and being 18.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which may indicate she is still developing independence and could be more susceptible to recidivism if not supported properly.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested 3 times with a conviction history, indicating prior involvement in the criminal system which can predict future behavior.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight of 220 lbs is above average and could be an indicator of potential substance abuse issues, which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"She is living alone with no spouse or partner, which might suggest a lack of support system that could contribute to instability and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Currently enrolled in school but has not held any job during the year, indicating limited income potential and possible dependence on substance abuse for survival.\"),\n    (\"drugs\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor as drug use often correlates with criminal behavior and instability.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, which could indicate resilience but may also suggest that she is managing her substance abuse without severe mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"high\", \"She lived with her biological mother in a household of size 7, indicating potential stress from living conditions or neglect, both of which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"god_involved\", \"low\", \"She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally, but without evidence of spiritual intervention against criminal behavior, this may not directly impact her risk.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"She held only 1 job during the year, which might suggest limited income potential and possible dependence on substance abuse for survival, increasing her risk of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 220 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
