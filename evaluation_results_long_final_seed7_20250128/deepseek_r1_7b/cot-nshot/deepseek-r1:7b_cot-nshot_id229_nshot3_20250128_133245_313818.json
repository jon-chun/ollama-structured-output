    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the examples provided. Let me start by breaking down each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 18 years old. In the examples, the older the person, sometimes there's a lower chance of rearrest because they're more likely to still be in school or have had time to find job opportunities. Here, he hasn't been convicted yet but has two prior arrests. I think his age might slightly influence this, so maybe it's a medium factor.\n\nEthnicity: He identifies as White. In example #3, another White male with similar factors had a YES outcome. So being White here doesn't seem to be a strong risk factor in itself, maybe low or no impact on recidivism compared to others like Black or Hispanic.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He has twoConvictions? Wait, the description says he's been arrested two times but hasn't been convicted yet. Hmm, in example #1 and #2, those with one prior arrest (not convicted) had a NO outcome. So maybe having two prior arrests without convictions could be a medium factor.\n\nMarital status: He's never been married and is living alone. In the examples, being single didn't seem to correlate strongly with rearrest in some cases, but it might depend on other factors. Maybe this is low or no impact here.\n\nWeight and height: 6 feet 5 inches, 185 lbs. The examples vary a lot in size, so maybe body type isn't a big factor unless there's something specific about his weight concerning health issues, which the user didn't mention. So probably low influence.\n\nEducation level: He has no high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. In example #2, someone with similar education had a NO outcome, so this could be medium but negative because lack of education might increase risk if not related to other factors.\n\nJob experience: He's held no jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to more time in prison or substance abuse issues, which can increase recidivism. So this is probably high risk.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct indicator of rearrest unless it leads to other issues like family problems. In example #3, he used both marijuana and cocaine but still had a YES outcome. Here, only marijuana was mentioned, which might be a medium factor.\n\nReligious belief: He considers God has something to do with his personal life. This could reduce stress or provide motivation for change, so maybe low risk here.\n\nHousehold size at age of arrest: He lived in a household of 5 when arrested. In example #2, someone from a household of 5 also had a NO outcome, but in another case, larger households might not be as stable. Maybe this factor is medium or no impact.\n\n living situation now: He's living alone with his spouse (from another example). Wait, here he's living alone. In the examples, being married didn't seem to have an effect on recidivism when other factors were considered. So maybe this is low risk.\n\nConsidering all these, the job experience and prior arrests are strong indicators of higher risk. Education level might be a moderate factor, but since he's not working, that could push him towards more issues. Drug use adds another layer without significant effect if not recent or severe. Religiosity helps but isn't enough to offset other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors like no job and two prior arrests likely point towards a YES outcome with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The person is 18 years old, which may slightly influence recidivism as they are still in school or have had time to find job opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being White does not seem to be a strong risk factor compared to other factors like prior arrests and education level.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two prior arrests without convictions could increase the risk, but since he hasn't been convicted yet, it might have a moderate influence.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no spouse does not seem to correlate strongly with rearrest in this context.\"),\n    (\"Weight and Height\", \"low\", \"No significant impact as there's no mention of health issues related to his weight or height.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education combined with not being enrolled in college could moderately increase the risk.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"high\", \"Held no jobs during the year, which can lead to increased time in prison or substance abuse issues, significantly increasing the risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 185 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 5. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
