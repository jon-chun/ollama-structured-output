    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. Let me start by going through each of the provided examples first to understand how they determine recidivism outcomes.\n\nIn Example #1, a Hispanic male with several risk factors like being married, having a high school diploma, working 4 jobs, and living in a household of seven\u2014all these were not deemed significant enough to predict a YES outcome. His re-arrest was NO. \n\nLooking at Example #2, this Black male had fewer arrest convictions but other negative factors\u2014living alone, no education, no job history\u2014but again his recidivism was NO.\n\nExample #3 is more concerning because he has multiple prior arrests (3), which counts against him, and a significant drug use (marijuana and cocaine). His emotional state during the month was very bad. He also lived with both parents in a rural area, which might indicate higher risk due to family stability but ended up with a YES outcome.\n\nNow, moving on to the case I need to predict: A 19-year-old White female with several risk factors. She has been arrested 6 times and convicted\u2014this is a high number of prior convictions, which should definitely increase the risk of recidivism. Her weight is between 125-149 lbs; not sure how that relates yet.\n\nShe's never married but isn't living alone either\u2014that might be a middle ground in terms of living situation stability. No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college\u2014she has limited education, which can contribute to recidivism. She held 2 jobs during the year\u2014it\u2019s low compared to her prior convictions.\n\nHer drug use is none in the past four years, but she felt very down for part of the month. Emotionally, that's a negative factor as it can impact decision-making and self-control. Living with her biological dad in a household of six in a rural area\u2014size might indicate more family support or perhaps living conditions could be less stable than other examples.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with her life, which could relate to moral values but not directly a risk factor unless it's about control over her behavior.\n\nPutting this together: Prior convictions are high (6), education is low (no diploma), limited job history (2 jobs), emotional state is poor (felt very down), and living situation in a rural household of 6. The fact that she has no drug use but still has a high risk from prior convictions seems the most significant factor.\n\nI think each of these factors should be weighted as high because they are strong indicators of recidivism. Prior convictions, education level, job history, emotional state, and living situation all point towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested 6 times and convicted, indicating significant criminal history which is strongly associated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lacking a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college significantly impacts her ability to reintegrate into society without further issues.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"low\", \"Held only 2 jobs during the year, which may indicate limited opportunities for stability and self-sufficiency.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Felt very down during the month, which can affect decision-making and control over behavior, increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Lived with her biological father in a household of size 6 in a rural area, possibly indicating less family support or more challenging living conditions that could contribute to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 6, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
