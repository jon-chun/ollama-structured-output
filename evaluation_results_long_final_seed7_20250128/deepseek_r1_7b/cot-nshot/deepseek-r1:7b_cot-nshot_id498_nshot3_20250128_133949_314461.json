    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at Example #1. He's a Black male, but he's not convicted yet\u2014just arrested once. His living situation is with his spouse, which might indicate stability. No drug use here, and he feels okay emotionally. But the outcome was NO rearrest. However, since this isn't convicted, maybe that factor doesn't play as much of a role.\n\nThen there's Example #2, also Black male but not convicted. He's living alone with no prior stable relationships, which might increase risk. No drugs or depression issues here either, and the outcome was NO. So being in an urban area could have some influence, maybe providing better resources?\n\nNow looking at Example #3: White male, arrested three times without convictions. More job experience and drug use (marijuana and cocaine) plus emotional distress. The outcome was YES. So that explains why more factors pointing towards higher risk.\n\nFor the case in question, he's Black, 19 years old, not convicted with one arrest, living alone, has a diploma, two jobs, moderate drug use (marijuana), and no depression. His background is similar to Example #2 but without convictions or a history of multiple arrests.\n\nHis living situation could be contributing to low risk since he's alone, which might mean fewer stressors. But his age isn't provided here\u2014he was 19 in the examples, so maybe that's still relevant? Not sure how much older individuals contribute compared to younger ones.\n\nHe has no prior convictions but one arrest, so maybe that's a mitigating factor. His education level and job stability could contribute positively as well.\n\nDrug use is only marijuana this time, which might be less severe than in Example #3 where cocaine was also involved, but still indicates some substance abuse issues.\n\nEmotional state\u2014he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. So overall, the risk factors that point towards higher risk are limited here compared to Example #3.\n\nPutting it all together: no prior convictions, living alone (low risk), stable situation, good education, job experience, moderate drug use without recent depression. The only negative factor might be his age if past recidivism rates suggest higher risk in that demographic, but since he's 19 and the examples don't specify, I'll assume similar to others.\n\nSo, weighing each factor: no prior convictions (low), living alone (low), stable situation (low), education (high), job experience (high), moderate drug use (medium), emotional well-being (high). The only possible negative is age if it's a risk factor for 19-year-olds, but I'm not certain. Without that information, leaning towards low to medium risk.\n\nGiven all this, the prediction would lean towards NO rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (not convicted)\", \"low\", \"This person has only one arrest, indicating limited criminal history which typically lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is generally associated with lower risk compared to living with others or in multi-person households.\"),\n    (\"Employment status\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma and being employed full-time contributes to better job stability and economic independence, which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"medium\", \"Moderate drug use can indicate potential substance abuse issues that may contribute to increased risk but not as significantly as in cases with more severe or chronic use.\"),\n    (\"Emotional well-being\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family background (household size 3)\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in a household of size 3 is relatively stable and supportive compared to other factors that might indicate instability or higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious belief (God has something to do with his life)\", \"high\", \"This factor suggests a sense of stability and direction which can be protective against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
