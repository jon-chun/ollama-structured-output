    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a history of being arrested twice and convicted once. That seems significant because prior convictions are strong indicators of higher risk. From the examples given, someone with even one prior conviction had an 'NO' outcome, so this might lean towards that as well.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 225-249 lbs. I'm not sure how weight relates to recidivism, but maybe heavier individuals are less likely to get jobs or support? Or perhaps it doesn't directly impact much here since other factors like living situation matter more.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse, which is a stabilizing factor. In the examples, being married had a positive outcome, so this might reduce risk.\n\nHe has no high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior again, contributing to higher recidivism.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Having stable employment is usually good for reducing recidivism because it provides a sense of purpose and reduces dependency on crime as a means of survival or escape.\n\nHis drug use: he has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. I'm not sure if this indicates ongoing substance abuse issues, which could be problematic. Substance abuse can lead to other criminal behaviors, so even occasional use might increase risk.\n\nHe feels down sometimes and can't find cheer. This emotional instability might contribute to self-harm or other risky behaviors that could lead to arrest or reoffending.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. Living with multiple family members is less stable compared to smaller households, which might correlate with higher risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and says it has nothing to do with his personal events. This lack of religious support or belief might affect his motivation towards positive change or community involvement, increasing recidivism chances.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior convictions, living situation, education level, employment history are mixed but leaning towards lower risk. Drug use, emotional state, and family background point towards higher risk. The balance seems to lean towards high risk since multiple factors like prior convictions, drug use, and unstable family environment suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior conviction for a crime, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with his spouse provides stability and reduces the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can impact job opportunities and self-sufficiency, contributing to moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Holding three jobs during the year indicates stable employment and reduced dependency on criminal activities for survival.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years could indicate ongoing substance abuse, which may lead to reoffending behavior.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Frequent feelings of depression and lack of ability to find cheer suggest potential for risky behaviors that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of five in a rural area may indicate less stable living conditions, increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"high\", \"Not believing in God or seeing no connection between personal events and divine intervention could reduce motivation for positive change.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 225 and 249 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
