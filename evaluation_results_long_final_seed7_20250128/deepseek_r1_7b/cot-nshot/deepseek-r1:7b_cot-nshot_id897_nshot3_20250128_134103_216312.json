    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this new case based on the given examples. Let me start by analyzing each risk factor in detail.\n\nFirst, looking at Example #1: This person is a Hispanic male, 21 years old, with one prior arrest and conviction. His living situation is married with four jobs, no drug use, and past positive affect. The outcome was NO rearrest. \n\nExample #2: A Black male, 19, with no prior convictions but one arrest. He's living alone, has no education, and a negative living environment resulted in NO rearrest.\n\nExample #3: White male, 19, three arrests without convictions, living alone, drug use, negative affect, and rural living led to YES rearrest.\n\nNow, the case I need to analyze is a White male, 20, with one prior arrest and conviction. His physical stats are similar to Example #1 but slightly different in height and weight. He's living alone, has a GED, no job experience beyond two, uses marijuana, positive affect, lived with his mother in a household of four rural area, and believes God doesn't influence his life.\n\nComparing this case to the examples, I notice that Example #3 had similar factors but more drug use and negative affect. Since our current case has low to no drug use (only marijuana) and positive affect, it's lower risk than Example #3. Also, the number of prior arrests is one, which in Example #1 led to NO rearrest.\n\nHowever, being White, maybe there are differences in recidivism rates based on race, though examples show mixed outcomes so maybe not a strong factor here.\n\nThe living situation: living alone versus being married or never married. In Example #2, living alone without prior convictions but one arrest had NO rearrest. Here, he's living alone with two prior jobs and GED, which might indicate better support.\n\nEducation level is another point: having a GED could provide some stability, similar to not being enrolled in college as in Examples 1 and 2. More education often correlates with lower recidivism.\n\nDrug use is only marijuana here, so that's less of a risk factor compared to Example #3 where both marijuana and cocaine were used.\n\nPositive affect (past month) is present here, which might indicate better mental health support or less stressors in the environment, contributing to lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest/conviction count (1), living alone, GED, positive affect, no heavy drug use. These factors lean towards a NO rearrest outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_convict\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest and conviction which can indicate past behavior that may influence future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"single_parent_household\", \"low\", \"Living in a single-parent household, though not explicitly stated here, the case does mention living with biological mother in a household of size 4, which might suggest some level of support but not as high as being married or cohabiting.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, which may provide some educational stability compared to those without any formal education or ongoing educational pursuits.\"),\n    (\"job_experience\", \"low\", \"The individual has held 2 jobs during the year, indicating some level of employment experience but less than the 4 jobs in Example #1 who had NO rearrest outcome.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past4years\", \"low\", \"The individual has used marijuana in the past four years but no mention of cocaine or other substances as in Example #3, which might lower the risk compared to higher drug use.'),\n    (\"positive_affect_last_month\", \"high\", \"The individual has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating a positive mental state that may contribute to better decision-making and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Living in a household of size 4 with biological mother suggests moderate family support compared to Example #3's household size of 3 but higher than living alone without such family ties as in Examples #1 and #2 who had NO rearrest outcomes.\"),\n    (\"god_influence\", \"low\", \"The individual considers that God has nothing to do with their life, which may indicate a more independent outlook compared to Example #3's belief that God has no influence but still resulted in YES rearrest due to other factors like higher drug use and negative affect.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
