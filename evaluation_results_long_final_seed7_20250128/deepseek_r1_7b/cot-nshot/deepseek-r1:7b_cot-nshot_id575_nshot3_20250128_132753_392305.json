    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: 21 years old. From what I know, younger individuals might have a lower chance of rearrest because they're still developing and maybe haven't established long-term ties yet.\n\nNext, race is White. Generally, White individuals might have slightly lower recidivism rates than some other races, but it's not the only factor here.\n\nArrest history: He was arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can be a red flag, especially if there were any serious charges or if he has a criminal tendency that isn't fully realized yet.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 143 lbs. Not sure how this affects recidivism directly, but maybe relates to health issues which could influence other factors like job stability.\n\nMarital status: He's not living alone. Living with someone might provide support and stability, reducing the risk of recidivism.\n\nEducation level: High school diploma and enrolled in a 2-year college. Higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and financial stability, which can reduce recidivism chances.\n\nNumber of jobs held: 4 during the year. Having multiple stable jobs is usually positive for recidivism because it shows responsibility and economic independence.\n\nDrug use: No drugs in the past four years. Clean drug history is a strong indicator of lower future crime rates.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed over the past month. Stable mental health can prevent substance abuse or other negative behaviors that contribute to recidivism.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: Lived with his biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area. Large households might have different dynamics, but for a young person, it could mean less family support and more stressors which might increase risk slightly.\n\nGod's role: He believes God has something to do with his life. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, sometimes positively or negatively depending on the context.\n\nPutting it all together, I weigh each factor:\n\n- Age (21): Low impact.\n- Race (White): Medium? Maybe lower than some other races but not a major factor here.\n- Arrest history: Medium risk because one arrest without conviction might suggest a possible tendency.\n- Height/weight: No direct impact; maybe low.\n- Marital status: High support, so low risk.\n- Education: High stability, so low risk.\n- Jobs: High stability and job satisfaction, so low risk.\n- Drug use: Very low risk because clean.\n- Household size: Medium? Maybe slightly higher due to living with multiple people without family support.\n- God's role: Could be positive or negative; maybe medium.\n\nConsidering all these, the factors that lean towards higher risk are perhaps the arrest history and household size. But since he's not convicted yet, maybe the risk is lower than Example 2 but higher than some others. I'd guess a 40% confidence of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 21 years old, which may indicate they are still developing and less likely to have long-term ties that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being White generally has a lower recidivism rate compared to other racial groups but this factor alone does not significantly increase risk in this case.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"One non-convicted arrest may suggest a potential tendency, but without conviction, it might indicate a possible risk factor that could lead to future issues if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant impact on recidivism as height and weight do not directly correlate with criminal behavior or recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"high\", \"Living with someone provides stability, reducing the risk of recidivism by providing support and a sense of security.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college indicates responsible behavior and future opportunities that can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"high\", \"Holding four jobs during the year suggests stability, job satisfaction, and economic independence, all factors that lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs for over four years is a strong indicator of substance abuse prevention and reduced risk of related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month indicates stable mental health, which can prevent behaviors that contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of five with his biological mother may have influenced family dynamics and could potentially increase stressors but without specific evidence of family support, it might not be a significant risk factor here.\"),\n    (\"God's Role\", \"low\", \"Believing God has something to do with life can influence behavior positively or negatively depending on context; however, in this case, it may not significantly affect recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 143 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
