    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this task where I need to analyze a risk assessment case for recidivism over three years. The user provided some examples with certain factors leading to outcomes, and then they want me to assign weights to each factor in another case.\n\nFirst, let's break down the example cases to understand what factors contribute to NO or YES outcomes.\n\nIn Example #1: A 21-year-old Hispanic male with one prior arrest, convicted. He has a high school diploma, holds four jobs, no drug use in past four years except marijuana, and lived alone at age 7. His outcome was NO.\n\nExample #2: A 19-year-old Black male without a conviction but arrested once; he lives alone, doesn't have a diploma, no job, no drug use or depression. Outcome was NO.\n\nExample #3: A 19-year-old White male with three arrests (unconvicted), heavy drug use in past four years, some depression, living alone, small household, outcome YES.\n\nSo the key factors seem to be prior convictions, age, race, living situation, education level, job history, drug use, family background, and personal mood.\n\nNow looking at the case to predict:\n\n- 21-year-old Black male, 2 prior arrests (convicted), height/weight: 5'7\"/155 lbs. Not married, not living alone. High school diploma, no college. Held 1 job during the year. Drug use past four years: marijuana only; no depression in last month. Youngest age he lived with mother in a household of five; considers God has something to do.\n\nSo factors here:\n\n1. Prior Arrests (2): Medium risk because more than one prior arrest without a conviction can increase recidivism.\n2. Age (21): Maybe medium, as 21 is just entering adulthood but still relatively young.\n3. Race (Black): High risk historically; Black individuals have higher rearrest rates compared to White or Hispanic.\n4. Living Alone: Not living alone\u2014moderate factor? Not sure if living with family reduces risk, so maybe lower than others.\n5. Education Level (High school diploma): Medium because having a diploma is positive but not college which might be more protective.\n6. Job History: Held 1 job\u2014it's better than none, but only one job isn't much.\n7. Drug Use: Past four years: marijuana\u2014medium risk; current use can predict higher recidivism.\n8. Depression/Mood: No depression in last month\u2014low risk here because no recent mental health issues.\n9. Family Background: Age 21 lived with mother in a household of five, urban? Maybe medium risk depending on the area.\n\nNow assigning weights:\n\n- Prior Arrests (2): High\n- Age (21): Medium\n- Race (Black): High\n- Living Alone: Not living alone\u2014so lower than if he was. Maybe medium?\nWait, actually, in example 3, someone not living alone had a White person with high school diploma and no job but still outcome YES because of other factors like drugs and family size.\n\nIn our case, he is living with mother but not alone; that might reduce risk compared to being single or in larger household. So maybe medium.\n- Education: Medium\n- Job History: Medium (held 1 job)\n- Drug Use: Previous four years marijuana\u2014high risk if frequent drug use can lead to relapse.\nWait, he used marijuana past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Maybe medium because prior drug use is bad but current mood isn't great either.\n\nBut in our case, he didn't feel depressed last month, so maybe lower than high.\n\n- Depression: Low (no recent issues)\n- Family Background: Age 21, living with mother in a household of five\u2014medium risk. If it was urban and more crime, maybe higher, but not specified here.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nPrior Arrests: High\nRace: High\nDrug Use: Medium\nLiving Alone: Medium (since he is living with someone)\nOthers like education, job history are medium or low.\n\nSo overall, high risk because of prior arrests and race. Drug use adds to it, but since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe reduces some of that risk.\n\nPutting this together, I'd predict a YES outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"High\", \"The individual has been arrested twice without a conviction.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 155 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
