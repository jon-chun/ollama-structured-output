    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. Let's start by looking at the given examples to understand how the recidivism outcome is determined.\n\nIn Example #1, the person is a Hispanic male with one prior arrest, now convicted. He has a high school diploma and some living situation factors like being married. His drug use in the past four years was marijuana only, which might be low risk since he hasn't used other drugs. He lived in a large household at a young age, which could indicate more support but maybe also higher risk due to living with multiple people who could have influenced him.\n\nThe outcome is NO rearrest within three years. So the factors that contribute here are likely positive ones like education and marriage.\n\nExample #2: A Black male with one arrest, not convicted. He lives alone, has no job or high school diploma, didn't use drugs, and lived with his mother in a small urban household. His outcome is also NO. Here, being in an urban area might offer more resources, but living alone could be a negative factor.\n\nExample #3: A White male with three arrests, no convictions, has some drug use (marijuana and cocaine), lives alone, was in a small rural household at a young age, and his outcome is YES. The higher number of prior arrests without convictions and the drug use are more concerning factors here.\n\nNow, looking at the case to predict:\n\n- 20-year-old Black male with two prior arrests (convicted). He's taller and within a weight range that might be average for someone his age.\n- Living alone, no job or diploma. No drug use in past four years but has some mood issues.\n- Lived with biological dad in a household of four at a young age.\n\nFirst, the prior convictions: two arrests mean he's had more contact with the system, which could indicate more unstable living situations or higher stress. Living alone is a red flag; being an only child might be different, but living with one parent can sometimes offer stability.\n\nHis weight and height don't directly correlate to risk here unless they suggest something about his health, but no info on that.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma which should be positive, as education tends to reduce recidivism.\n\nNo drug use is good, but the mood issues could indicate underlying mental health problems. However, he's not using drugs now, so that's a mitigating factor.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in a household of four might suggest some level of family support, which can be positive, but if it's a strict environment or if there were disciplinary issues, that could still be negative.\n\nConsidering all these factors: two prior convictions (medium high), living alone (high), no job and diploma (low), mood issues (maybe medium low as they might indicate other issues but not directly linked to substance use), and family living situation (maybe medium).\n\nPutting it together: The two prior arrests are a significant factor, so that's a high weight. Living alone is definitely high risk because it could lead to isolation or lack of support. The mood issues might be low unless they're severe.\n\nSo the weighted factors would lean towards high for prior arrests and living alone. The other factors like education (low) and no drug use (low), but mood issues are medium low.\n\nThus, when considering all risk factors together, this person's likelihood of rearrest is higher. But I'm not sure how much it tilts one way or the other between high and maybe medium-high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has two prior arrests which indicates a history of unstable living situations and potential stress, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and lack of support, which are significant factors contributing to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"No Job or Diploma\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without any job experience shows some level of education but no active engagement in the workforce, which is slightly mitigating but not directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mood Issues\", \"medium_low\", \"The individual reports mood issues, which could indicate underlying health problems or personal stressors that might influence behavior but are not directly tied to substance use leading to rearrest.\"), \n    (\"Family Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological father in a household of four may provide some level of family support but doesn't guarantee stability and can still be a risk factor depending on the environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
