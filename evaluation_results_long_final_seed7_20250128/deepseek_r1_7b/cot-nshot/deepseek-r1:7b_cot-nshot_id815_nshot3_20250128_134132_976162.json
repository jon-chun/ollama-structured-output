    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the risk factors provided. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: she's 21 years old. In some studies, younger adults have a higher chance of rearrest compared to older individuals who might be closer to retirement age. So that could lean towards a higher risk.\n\nNext, race: she identifies as White. From the examples given, it seems like White individuals in those cases sometimes had outcomes like NO or YES. I'm not sure if there's a trend here, but White might indicate some difference in treatment or support systems which could influence her risk level.\n\nNumber of prior arrests and convictions: she has 1 arrest and is convicted. That definitely increases the risk because prior convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior.\n\nHeight and weight: She's 5'5\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. The examples didn't mention height or weight, but sometimes being underweight or overweight can be associated with substance abuse issues, which she does have a history of using marijuana.\n\nMarital status: She's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can increase stress and isolation, both of which are known triggers for criminal behavior or substance abuse issues that could lead to recidivism.\n\nEducation level: She has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Completing high school is generally associated with lower recidivism rates, so this might be a mitigating factor.\n\nJob history: She's held 3 jobs during the year. Having some job experience can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities that lead to further arrests.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially substances like marijuana, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities.\n\nHousehold size at age: She lived with her biological mother in a household of 3 in a rural area. Smaller households might have different dynamics that could influence her behavior, but I'm not sure how much that impacts recidivism directly.\n\ngod factor: She believes God has something to do with her life. This is more of a personal belief and doesn't directly correlate with recidivism rates, though supportive beliefs can sometimes be associated with better outcomes if there's community support.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrests increase the risk significantly. Her living situation alone might contribute stressors. Drug use is present, which is a strong indicator. Age being 21 isn't necessarily bad but could still be relevant. Her White race doesn't directly point to recidivism in this context without more data.\n\nConsidering all these factors lean towards a higher risk but not extremely high. The prior arrest and drug use are the strongest indicators here. So, I would predict a YES outcome with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may increase rearrest risk as younger adults can sometimes have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals closer to retirement age.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Her identification as White might not inherently indicate a specific trend in the examples provided, but race could play a role based on societal factors and support systems.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has 1 prior arrest and a conviction, which are strong predictors of future criminal behavior and increased risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Her height (5'5\") and weight range (150-174 lbs) do not show any specific association with substance abuse or recidivism in the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age can increase stress and isolation, which are known triggers for criminal behavior or substance abuse issues that may lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college slightly mitigates recidivism risk compared to those without a high school diploma, as education provides stability and reduces exposure to criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"Holding 3 jobs during the year may provide some job experience, which can reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities that lead to further arrests.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana in the past four years is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it impairs judgment and increases the likelihood of illegal activities leading to further arrests.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of size 3 might have different dynamics, but there's no direct indication from the examples that this contributes significantly to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence on Life\", \"low\", \"Her belief that God has something to do with her life does not directly correlate with recidivism rates without additional context about community support or influence.\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
