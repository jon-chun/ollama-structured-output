    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze the risk factors for this 22-year-old Black male who has been arrested three times but not convicted. His height is 5'7\", weighs 160 lbs, living alone, no high school diploma, held one job, uses marijuana, feels very down every month, and lived in a household with five adults other than his biological parents.\n\nLooking at the examples provided: Example 1 had a similar age group but didn't end up rearrested. Example 2 also was younger without convictions, but again no rearrest. However, Example 3 ended up with a YES outcome despite fewer arrests and more drug use.\n\nNow, breaking down each risk factor:\n\nAge is slightly older than the examples, which might increase recidivism.\nArrests: Three times\u2014not convictions\u2014might indicate past issues that could lead to future offenses.\nNo diploma/GED can mean less stable employment or higher risk of unemployment leading to substance abuse.\nLiving alone increases vulnerability to stress and substance use.\nUsing marijuana regularly is a drug use issue, which is linked to higher recidivism rates.\nFeeling very down every month points towards mental health issues, which are strong predictors of poor outcomes.\n\nConsidering these factors heavily weigh towards a high risk. The combination of past arrests, lack of education, substance abuse, and mental state makes this case quite serious. So, the prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is slightly older than the examples provided, indicating potential increased vulnerability to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"Three arrests without convictions suggest a history of problematic behavior that could lead to future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate indicates less stable employment opportunities and higher risk of unemployment, which can contribute to substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Housing Stability\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may increase stress and exposure to negative influences, though it is not as directly correlated with recidivism as other factors like drug use.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Held only one job during the year, which might provide some stability but could also indicate difficulty finding meaningful employment in the past.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Regular marijuana use and current severe emotional distress are strong indicators of substance abuse issues, which are often linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Lived with five adults other than biological parents in a household of size 5, which may have contributed to stress or neglect, potentially affecting mental health and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"high\", \"F frequent negative emotional state, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates as it can lead to impulsive or impede decision-making behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He is separated and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
