    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given case using the provided examples and then assign weights to each risk factor. Let me start by understanding the examples.\n\nIn Example #1, a Black male with several factors like prior arrest, living situation in a household of seven, considering God as a positive influence, but no convictions or significant drug use had a NO outcome. \n\nExample #2 is another Black male without prior convictions, living alone, no education, no jobs, and negative feelings about religion, also resulting in NO.\n\nExample #3 is White with multiple rearrests, drug use, negative mood, rural living, and no religious influence leading to YES.\n\nNow, looking at the case: a 20-year-old female Black. She's been arrested once but not convicted. Weight 238 lbs, so tall and heavy. Living alone, never married. High school diploma, not in college. Held 3 jobs last year. Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) and some severe mood issues. Lived with her biological mother in a household of five urban area. Believes God has something to do.\n\nFirst, prior arrest: once but not convicted\u2014medium risk because even though no conviction, an arrest can still influence recidivism.\n\nAge: 20 is young, might be more prone due to inexperience\u2014but in the example, being Black with prior issues could counteract that. Maybe low or medium? Not sure yet.\n\nGender: Female vs. Male examples have different outcomes. In Example #1 male, female not given but considering her as Black and female\u2014maybe influence is neutral here.\n\nRace: Black, similar to Examples 1 and 2. Since in those cases without convictions, outcome was NO. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nEducation: High school diploma\u2014not college. The examples with no diploma had lower risk? Wait, Example #3 did have a diploma but more factors led to YES. So diploma is neutral here.\n\nMarital status: Single\u2014similar to Example 2's single person, which was NO. Not sure how it affects female vs male.\n\nHousing stability: Living alone in urban area. Examples with living alone had lower risk. Maybe low influence.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine, similar to Example #3 which had YES due to more factors but also prior issues. Her recent use might be a medium factor.\n\nMood: She felt down often. Negative mood is a known risk factor\u2014high weight here.\n\nHousehold size and living with biological mother in urban area\u2014in Example 2, similar situation led to NO. Maybe positive influence from family? Or urban environment could have different dynamics.\n\nReligious belief: She believes God has something to do with her life\u2014low or medium because it's a protective factor for some but not always.\n\nNumber of jobs held: She had 3 last year, which is better than none as in Example 2. More job stability might reduce risk\u2014so lower weight here.\n\nPutting this together, the high influence factors are mood and drug use (high), prior arrest (medium). The positive influences like family living situation could counter some negative factors but not enough to offset the mood issues.\n\nGiven that, I'd lean towards a low confidence of recidivism. So maybe an 85% NO prediction with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest without a conviction, which can influence recidivism risk but does not guarantee a repeat offense.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine, along with potential ongoing substance abuse, significantly increases the risk of relapse or new offenses.\"),\n    (\"Mood Issues\", \"high\", \"Experiencing severe mood swings and down Syndrome can exacerbate existing mental health issues, potentially leading to increased stress and substance use which could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Household Stability\", \"low\", \"Living alone provides a sense of stability and reduces exposure to potential triggers such as family dysfunction or environmental stressors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 238 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
