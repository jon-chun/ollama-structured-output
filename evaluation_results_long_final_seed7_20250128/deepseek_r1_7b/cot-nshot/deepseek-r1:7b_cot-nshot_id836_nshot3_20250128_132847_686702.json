    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 22 years old. In Example #3, someone who was 19 had a high recidivism rate when they were convicted multiple times and had more job experience. But in this case, he's 22, which might mean he has some life experience, so maybe lower risk. But I'm not sure how age directly affects it.\n\nNext, Hispanic origin: He identifies as White. In Example #1, being Hispanic was a factor, but here he's White, and Examples don't have data on White males with similar factors. So maybe this doesn't add much weight.\n\nConvictions vs arrests: He has been arrested 7 times but hasn't been convicted in all of them. In Example #2, someone with an arrest but no conviction had a low outcome, so maybe having more convictions is better here?\n\nHeight and weight: He's 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 160 lbs. The examples don't mention this much, so perhaps not a significant factor.\n\nMarital status: Living alone since he's never been married. Example #2 was also living alone, but that person had no prior issues, while this one has more arrests. So maybe being solitary is bad for recidivism?\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED and isn't in college. Examples with similar factors like Example #3 didn't hold convictions, so maybe education level is a risk factor.\n\nNumber of jobs: He's held 2 jobs during the year. More job experience usually reduces risk, but if he lost them due to arrests, that might increase it. But since he's not in college and has multiple arrests, I'm not sure.\n\nDrug use: He uses marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong recidivism indicator because it can lead to more criminal behavior or supervision issues after release.\n\nMood: Some of the time he feels down, which could affect his ability to get employed or function in society, increasing risk.\n\nHousehold size at age: He lived with his biological mother in a household of 5. In Example #2, households with parents were low risk, but this person has more arrests, so maybe the household environment isn't protective anymore.\n\nReligion: He believes God is involved. While religion can be protective if it provides support, sometimes it might also mean lack of self-reliance if he's struggling with issues like drug use or depression.\n\nPutting it all together: He's been arrested multiple times (7), which is high. Drug use and mood issues are bad signs. No education, living alone, and a larger household at 19 but now being solitary again might not be as protective because of the prior issues. So I'm leaning towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (7 times)\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested multiple times, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for future misconduct.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Heavy drug use can lead to increased risk of substance abuse, which may affect employment and daily functioning, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mood Issues\", \"medium\", \"Sustained feelings of depression or low mood could impair judgment, self-reliance, and ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (no diploma/GED)\", \"high\", \"A lack of education can limit opportunities for positive outcomes and may contribute to risk-taking behaviors that lead to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience (held 2 jobs)\", \"low\", \"Having held a limited number of jobs, especially if those positions were unstable or terminated due to arrests, suggests lower stability but not necessarily immediate risk.\",\n     \"Religious Beliefs (God involved in his life)\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God can provide support and guidance, which may help mitigate some negative factors like drug use, but it does not fully protect against recidivism if other risk factors are present.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (living alone)\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases vulnerability to stressors such as unemployment or living in a challenging environment, both of which can contribute to criminal behavior and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 19 (5 people)\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a larger household with parents provided some protective factors, but this individual has faced multiple arrests since then, indicating a lack of stability that may negate those benefits.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White.
