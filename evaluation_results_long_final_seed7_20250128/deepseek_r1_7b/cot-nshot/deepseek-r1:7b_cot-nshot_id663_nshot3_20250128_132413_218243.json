    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. Let's start with the individual details.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. He has one arrest but no conviction. His weight is in the higher end of his range\u2014200-224 lbs. He's living alone, which might be an indicator for some risk factors. Education-wise, he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't attending college. That could be a red flag since education can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism.\n\nHe's worked one job during the year. Only one job; maybe it wasn't stable or fulfilling enough to contribute positively. Drug use includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's significant because drug use is often linked to higher recidivism rates, especially if it's been ongoing recently.\n\nHis mental health has been an issue too\u2014feeling down for much of the past month. This could indicate underlying issues that might contribute to criminal behavior or self-harm. It's also concerning that he considers God not related to his personal experiences, which might suggest a lack of spirituality or guidance in dealing with these problems.\n\nHe lived with both parents at age 16 in a household of four in an urban area. That environment could be stressful and possibly associated with higher risk factors like substance abuse or unstable family dynamics.\n\nNow, looking at the examples given:\n\nExample #1: A similar Hispanic male without convictions, living with spouse, no drug use, married, and high school educated didn't rearrest. But our case has more drug use and less education, so maybe a different outcome.\n\nExample #2: Black male, not convicted, but similar factors leading to no rearrest. However, his background is different\u2014living alone, no job, no education, etc., yet the outcome was also NO. Not sure how that affects our case.\n\nExample #3: White male with three arrests, used both marijuana and cocaine, had some bad mental health, and a smaller household in rural area\u2014all leading to YES. But our case doesn't have as many prior arrests or as severe drug use but has other negative factors like living alone and being Hispanic.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nWeighting the risk factors:\n- Age: 21\u2014Youth is often associated with higher recidivism.\n- Hispanic origin: Hispanic males sometimes face discrimination, which can increase risk.\n- One arrest (no conviction): Even though not convicted, an arrest can be a warning sign.\n- Weight: Higher than average could indicate potential stress or substance issues.\n- Living alone: Living in isolation might contribute to emotional distress and substance use.\n- Lack of education: Lower education is linked with higher recidivism rates.\n- Drug use (marijuana, cocaine): Substance abuse is strongly predictive of future criminal behavior.\n- Mental health issues: Persistent negative emotions could lead to self-harm or further criminal acts.\n- Urban living: Urban environments can be stressors and correlates with higher recidivism.\n\nConsidering these factors, each points towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. Even though prior convictions aren't there, the other factors are strong indicators. So despite some mitigating factors like no education, the cumulative risk is high enough to predict a YES outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is typically associated with higher recidivism rates due to increased impulsivity and decision-making during youth.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic origin may not be a direct risk factor without specific contextual issues such as discrimination or systemic factors.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
