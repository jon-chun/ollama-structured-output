    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old White male. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a high arrest count\u20148 times\u2014and has been convicted. That's definitely a strong indicator of past behavior issues, which should be a high weight. High convictions usually correlate with more likely to reoffend.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. While his height isn't too concerning, his weight range is on the lower side for someone his age, but without more info on BMI or health issues, I can't say much about it beyond maybe affecting employment, which could be a risk factor.\n\nNever married and living alone\u2014maybe some underlying issues he's dealing with alone. Living arrangements can sometimes correlate with substance use or other behavioral problems.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school might indicate lower self-esteem or higher risk of engaging in risky behaviors, so that could be a medium weight factor.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs in the past year\u2014two jobless spells would be more concerning, but having two shows he can work, which is positive. Maybe some temporary issues causing unemployment.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct cause of rearrest, but it might indicate underlying mental health issues or other problems contributing to recidivism.\n\nHousehold size at 4\u2014maybe he's dealing with family issues or has emotional challenges that could impact his behavior. Smaller household can sometimes lead to higher stress if there are unresolved issues.\n\nReligion\u2014he believes God has nothing to do with his life, which might point towards self-destructive behaviors or a lack of moral guidance, increasing the risk.\n\nPutting it all together: High number of arrests (8), no college degree, living alone, drug use, and personal beliefs. These factors seem to be pointing towards a higher risk of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Count\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 8 times, which is a significant number indicating past problematic behavior that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate underlying issues or stressors that may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"GED and College Enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and not enrolled in college suggests some educational barriers but does not directly correlate with recidivism unless other factors are considered.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Held only 2 jobs in the past year, which is concerning as joblessness can increase risk of engaging in risky behaviors or seeking alternative employment opportunities that may lead to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years but has not felt depressed recently.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 8 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
