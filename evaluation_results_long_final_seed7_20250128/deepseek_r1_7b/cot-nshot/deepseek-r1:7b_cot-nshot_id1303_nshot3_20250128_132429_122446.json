    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and see how they stack up based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 200-224 lbs. Looking at Example #1 and #2, both had higher weights (190lbs and 135lbs) but still ended with NO outcomes. The weight here is a bit on the higher side, but maybe it's okay because he has other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and convicted once. In Example #3, someone with three arrests didn't get a conviction and had a YES outcome. Here, two arrests with one conviction might be lower risk compared to that example.\n\nAge-wise, 18 is quite young, but in Example #2, a similar age (19) ended with NO. Young adults can sometimes have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing skills and relationships.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. That might be a protective factor since he doesn't have family support, as seen in Examples where living with family had lower outcomes.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. From the examples, education seems to play a role. Not having a diploma could increase the risk, similar to Example #3 which didn't get a conviction but still had a YES outcome.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. More stable employment usually reduces recidivism, so this is a protective factor. In Examples, people with more jobs had lower outcomes.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a risk factor if it leads to instability or self-harm, but since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe the risk isn't as high here.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area at a young age. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could increase risk compared to Examples where rural areas had lower outcomes like Example #1 and #2.\n\nBelief in God: he thinks God has something to do with his life. That's generally protective as religious beliefs can provide support and structure.\n\nPutting it all together: He has two convictions, but not three; no high school diploma; living alone; and some risk factors like past drug use and urban living. The positive aspects are more about family and belief in God. Based on the examples, the outcome is a bit mixed. In Example #3, someone with similar factors had a YES, but here he has fewer arrests and better education background than that case.\n\nI think his low risk factors might make him lean towards NO, but since he was arrested twice, maybe it's a medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests_convictions\", \"medium\", \"The person has one conviction out of two arrests.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
