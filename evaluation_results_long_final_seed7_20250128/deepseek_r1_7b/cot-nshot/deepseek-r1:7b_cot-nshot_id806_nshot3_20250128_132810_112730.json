    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this person based on the examples given. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. The first example was a 21-year-old with similar characteristics and had a NO outcome. That's a high school graduate not enrolled in college, which might be a medium risk because education can correlate with lower recidivism if he's completing it. He's White, which isn't mentioned as an explicit factor but might relate to other variables.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In Example 2, someone with similar stats (Black, arrested once, living alone) had a NO outcome. So being arrested once might be low risk since he hasn't been convicted yet; maybe not a strong negative indicator here.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and weight 180 lbs, which doesn't seem extreme. No drug use in the past four years\u2014Example 2 shows no drug use leading to NO outcome. That's good news for him.\n\nHe's living alone with never been married, similar to Examples 1 and 2 who were in similar situations but had NO outcomes. So living alone might not be a high risk here.\n\nHigh school diploma is present; he's not enrolled in college. Education is generally protective, so maybe that contributes to low risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year\u2014more stable employment can reduce recidivism, so this would likely contribute to lower risk.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Example 3 had some depression but still a YES outcome because of other factors. This person seems mentally stable, which is positive.\n\nLived with both parents at age young, household size 4 in an urban area. Urban living can sometimes correlate with more exposure to issues like crime or substance abuse, but since he's White and has good stats (arrests not convictions, education), this might be a lower risk factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014so he has a strong moral support system, which is generally protective against recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together: He has no prior convictions, stable job, no drug use, good education, living alone, no depression. The only negative factors are being Hispanic (though not explicitly a factor here), and maybe the urban area? But in Example 2, someone from an urban area had NO outcome as well.\n\nSo weighing each factor: Low risk mostly because of non-conviction arrest, stable job, no drug use, education, living alone. Even though he's Hispanic, in Example 1 it was a factor but resulted in NO, so maybe that doesn't apply here or applies less strongly. The urban area might be medium, but overall his positive factors dominate.\n\nTherefore, I would predict a NO outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The person is 21 years old, which aligns with the first example where a similar age group had a low recidivism rate.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"low\", \"He has been arrested once but not convicted, similar to Example 2, which resulted in a NO outcome.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs, which does not indicate any significant physical issues that could correlate with higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"He has not used any drugs in the past four years, aligning with Example 2's NO outcome despite a similar background.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"low\", \"He is living alone and never married, which is a protective factor as seen in Examples 1 and 2.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, contributing to lower risk as seen in Example 3 with a NO outcome despite prior arrests.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"He has held four jobs during the year, which typically correlates with better job stability and reduced recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, contributing positively to his risk profile as seen in Example 3's NO outcome despite prior issues.\"),\n    (\"Household Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in an urban area may present some concerns but is mitigated by other positive factors.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"His belief that God has something to do with his life provides a strong moral support system, which is protective against recidivism as seen in Example 3's NO outcome despite prior issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 95\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
