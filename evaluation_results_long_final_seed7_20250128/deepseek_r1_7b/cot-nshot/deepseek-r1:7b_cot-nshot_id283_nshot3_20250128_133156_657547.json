    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors and examples. First, I'll break down each factor in the current case and compare them to the examples provided.\n\nSo, the person is an 18-year-old Black male. He's been arrested twice and convicted once. His height is 6'3\", which is quite tall, but weight is 270 lbs\u2014so he's heavy. He's living alone with no spouse or partner. He has a high school diploma but is enrolled in a 2-year college, so that's some education but not a degree yet.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year, which might indicate he's somewhat stable. Drug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and most of the time in the last month he felt really down. That's significant because drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism.\n\nHe lived at a young age with adults other than biological parents in a household of three in a rural area. That might suggest he was raised in a less stable environment, which can be a risk factor. His belief that God has something to do with his life could indicate some level of religious involvement, but if it's too strong, maybe it mitigates some risks.\n\nNow, looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1: A Hispanic male, low recidivism despite being married and having some drug use. He didn't feel depressed in the last month.\nExample 2: Black male, not convicted, living alone with no job or drugs, no depression\u2014NO recidivism.\nExample 3: White male, multiple convictions, drug use, severe depression\u2014YES recidivism.\n\nComparing to our case:\n\nAge is younger (18 vs. 19+), but that might mean less life experience. Being Black is similar to Example 2 in terms of race and no conviction, so he's like a non-convicted Black male with similar living situation as Example 2, which had NO outcome.\n\nHowever, our case has more convictions (2) compared to Example 2 (0), which could increase the risk. Drug use is present here, unlike Example 2 but similar to Example 3. The severe depression in the last month adds another layer of risk beyond drug use.\n\nThe living situation with parents and household size might be different from the examples\u2014if the previous examples had more family support, this case has less, which could increase risk.\n\nEducation: He's got a diploma and is in college, which isn't as strong as Example 2 (no education but enrolled). Maybe higher education slightly mitigates risk compared to lower levels or no degree.\n\nEmployment: Two jobs vs. none\u2014it might show some stability that wasn't present before, possibly reducing the risk.\n\nSo putting it all together: He has more convictions than a similar case in Example 2, which could push him towards YES. Drug use and severe depression are significant factors that point towards YES. The living situation is different from Examples but doesn't necessarily add much beyond what's seen in Example 3.\n\nConsidering the balance of these factors, it seems like he has enough risk points to lean towards a YES outcome.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The person is 18 years old, which may indicate less life experience compared to older individuals, potentially affecting recidivism outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Black race is considered in Example 2 as a risk factor for recidivism, but this case doesn't directly correlate without more data.\"),\n    (\"Convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests and one conviction increase the likelihood of reoffending compared to similar cases with fewer convictions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use in the past four years is a known risk factor for recidivism, contributing to the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Depression\", \"high\", \"Experienced severe depression most of the last month significantly correlates with increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no spouse or partner may indicate some level of stability compared to past examples where living with family was a factor.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma and enrolled in college provide some educational stability but don't neutralize the risk factors present.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs during the year, which may offer some job experience compared to a case with no prior employment.\"),\n    (\"Living Environment\", \"low\", \"Lived with non-biological parents in a household of three in a rural area; this is unique but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism outcomes in provided examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 270 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
