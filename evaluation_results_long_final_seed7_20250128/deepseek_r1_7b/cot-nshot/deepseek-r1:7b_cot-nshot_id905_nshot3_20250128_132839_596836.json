    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old Black male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with two arrests but no convictions. That's pretty significant because having any arrest can increase the chance of reoffending. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe weighs between 175-199 lbs at 5'11\". Weight in this range isn't necessarily bad, but combined with his height and other factors might influence it differently.\n\nMarital status: He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can be isolating, which sometimes correlates with higher recidivism rates as people might not seek help or support when needed.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education is usually a positive factor, but if he hasn't pursued further education, it could mean less opportunities for positive development or better job prospects, increasing risk.\n\nNumber of jobs: He's held three jobs during the year. Having stable employment can reduce stress and financial strain, which are linked to recidivism. So this might be a lower risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is excellent; it shows he's been clean, which is protective against substance abuse leading to further crimes.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Maintaining mental health can prevent self-harm or other risky behaviors that might lead to more criminal activity.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. Living in such a large household in a rural setting could mean less supervision and more exposure to negative influences typical of rural areas.\n\nBelief in God: He thinks God has something to do with his life. A strong moral support can be protective against criminal behavior, as it might provide guidance or ethical standards.\n\nPutting this all together, the main risk factors are the two arrests without convictions and living in a challenging household. The positive factors like education and stable employment help mitigate but aren't enough to lower the overall risk significantly. Considering the examples provided, even with some mitigating factors, the presence of prior arrests can tip the recidivism outcome towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of previous arrests\", \"high\", \"This individual has a history of two arrests but no convictions, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone after never being married can lead to isolation and potential stressors that may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment suggests less access to resources for positive development, which could indirectly affect risk but is mitigated by other factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs indicates some financial stability, which can reduce stress and may lower recidivism risk compared to those with no employment or fewer stable positions.\"),\n    (\"Drug use history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests a clean slate and reduced opportunities for substance abuse-related crimes.\"),\n    (\"Mental health status\", \"high\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month indicates good mental health, which is protective against self-harm or risky behaviors that could lead to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\" household living conditions at a young age\", \"high\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area suggests exposure to environmental factors typical of rural settings, which can be challenging and may contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's influence on life\", \"medium\", \"His belief in God could provide guidance or ethical standards that might reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior compared to those without such support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
