    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment case step by step. I'm going to break down each factor in the provided case and compare it with the examples given. \n\nFirst, age: The person is 22 years old. Looking at Example #1, a similar age of 21 had an outcome of NO. Since 22 isn't drastically different, maybe this doesn't add much weight.\n\nRace: Black. Examples show mixed outcomes for Black individuals. Example #2 was NO without any prior convictions and living alone, while Example #3 was White with multiple arrests but had a YES outcome due to some factors like prior drug use and emotional state. So race might be neutral here.\n\nNumber of arrests and convictions: 6 arrests, 4 convictions (since it's stated as 6 times arrested and 4 convicted). In Examples, higher number of arrests tends to correlate with recidivism. Example #3 had 3 arrests but a NO outcome due to other mitigating factors like no prior convictions.\n\nWeight: High. This person has multiple serious arrests, which is a strong indicator of past behavior that could lead to reoffending.\n\nCurrent employment status: He's never been married and is living alone with no jobs. In Examples, Example #2 had someone living alone without any work, which resulted in NO. So lack of job stability might be a risk factor here.\n\nDrug use: He uses marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as seen in all examples where drug use was present. Example #1 used marijuana but didn't feel depressed recently (which might mitigate), but this person does have recent drug use, so definitely high risk.\n\nEmotional state: He feels down often. In Example #2, he felt no depression and had a NO outcome, while in Example #3, higher depression was linked to YES. This person's current emotional state is a risk factor here.\n\n household stability: Lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of 4 in an urban area. In Example #1, living in a large household led to NO, but Example #2 lived alone and also had NO. However, this person's household size and environment might indicate instability, which is a mitigating factor.\n\nGod involvement: He believes God has something to do with his life. This is positive for recidivism as seen in Examples where belief was present (Example #1) but others without it had lower outcomes? Wait, Example #2 didn't feel depressed and had NO, while this person's belief might actually be a mitigating factor compared to Example #3 which had higher recidivism despite some other factors. So maybe the high God involvement lowers risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The person has multiple arrest convictions (high), drug use (high), current emotional state (low but recent high), living alone without job (medium), and religious belief (low mitigating). \n\nThe highest risk comes from prior arrests, drug use, and current negative emotions. So the prediction would lean towards YES, with a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 22 years old, which doesn't vary significantly from Example #1's age of 21 and may not add significant weight to the risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"neutral\", \"Black individuals in Examples #2 and #3 had mixed outcomes.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
