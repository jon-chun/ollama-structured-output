    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So the user wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided some examples of risk factors and their outcomes over three years for rearrest recidivism. Now, they're giving another case and asking me to analyze it using those examples.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each example clearly. In Example #1, the person is 21, Hispanic, with a high school diploma but not enrolled in college. He has no prior convictions, just one arrest. He's married living with his spouse, which might indicate stability. No drug use and positive emotional state. He lived in a big household, maybe less stable environment. High involvement with God could be seen as positive or negative depending on context.\n\nOutcome was NO rearrest. So factors that led to this: no prior convictions, stable living situation (married), positive emotions, and perhaps lack of risk.\n\nExample #2 is similar but the person isn't convicted yet. He's Black, living alone, with no job, no drug use, and lived in a smaller household without God involved. Also outcome was NO.\n\nExample #3 has more prior arrests (3), uses drugs, negative mood, small family in rural area, and he doesn't believe in God. Outcome was YES, meaning rearrest occurred.\n\nNow the case to predict is an 18-year-old White male with 2 arrests but no conviction. He's taller than average at 6'1\", weighs less but still over 150 lbs. Never married, living alone, has a GED, not in college, held one job, drug use (marijuana), positive emotional state, and lived with his biological mother in an urban household of size 5 without much spiritual involvement.\n\nLooking at the examples, higher number of prior arrests (like Example #3) usually lead to YES outcomes. Here he has only 2 arrests but not convicted yet. That might be lower risk compared to someone with more convictions.\n\nHe's living alone, which is often a sign of instability or higher risk for substance use and other issues. His one job could indicate some stability, but he's still in his late teens, so maybe not as stable as someone older.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) can be a significant risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment, substance abuse, which can contribute to recidivism. Plus, if he feels positive emotions, that might make him more likely to engage in risky behaviors again after being released from incarceration or supervision.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area could mean different things\u2014maybe a more stable environment compared to smaller households, but urban areas can have higher crime rates and stressors which might contribute.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God, which some argue could be linked to risk-taking behaviors. However, this factor alone isn't enough to predict YES; it's the combination of factors that matters.\n\nComparing to Example #3, he has fewer prior arrests but more drug use and negative spiritual involvement. So maybe his risk is higher than someone with similar factors in Example #2 or #1.\n\nSo assigning weights: Prior Arrests (high), Drug Use (high), Living Alone (high), Uneducated (medium?), GED (low), Positive Emotions (low). The other factors like family size and living area might be low to medium as well. \n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors that are high or medium would dominate. Prior arrests and drug use seem particularly significant here. So I'd predict a YES with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests (2 times but not convicted)\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested twice, which is higher than the average risk factor in previous examples but does not yet meet the threshold for a high-risk outcome.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana in past four years)\", \"high\", \"The use of marijuana could increase the likelihood of substance abuse and impaired decision-making, which are significant risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone is often associated with higher risk of instability, substance abuse, and other risky behaviors that can lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No Educational Qualifications (GED certificate)\", \"low\", \"Having a GED certificate indicates some level of education, which may reduce the likelihood of recidivism compared to individuals without any qualifications.\"),\n    (\"Positive Emotional State (has not felt depressed over past month)\", \"low\", \"A positive emotional state is generally protective against recidivism and suggests that the individual is in good mental health.\"),\n    (\"Living with Biological Mother in Urban Area\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area may provide stability but could also be associated with higher stressors or exposure to crime, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Does Not Believe in God\", \"low\", \"A lack of belief in God is not strongly linked to recidivism outcomes and may even suggest lower risk behaviors.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 157 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
