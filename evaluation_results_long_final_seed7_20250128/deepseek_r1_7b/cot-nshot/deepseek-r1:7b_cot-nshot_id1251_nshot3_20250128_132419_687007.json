    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to help this user by analyzing a risk assessment case. They provided examples with certain factors leading to outcomes, so I need to use that information.\n\nFirst, the case is of a 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once and convicted, which probably increases his recidivism. His weight and height don't seem relevant here; it's more about his criminal history.\n\nHe's living alone with no prior marriage, so family support might be low. No high school diploma means he has less educational backing, possibly affecting future opportunities but maybe not directly linked to crime unless he's a student.\n\nHe held two jobs last year, which could indicate some stability or work experience that might help him get back on track if he reoffenses.\n\nNo drug use and no depression in the past month are positive factors. That suggests he's mentally stable, reducing the risk of relapsing after being released from prison.\n\nHis early life was quite troubled\u2014he lived with non-biological parents in a household of six. This could point to a chaotic upbringing which might have contributed to his criminal behavior or other issues that could persist.\n\nHe believes in God affecting his life, which might mean he's more likely to stay within the law as he seeks divine guidance rather than engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nNow, looking at the examples given earlier, being convicted once (Example 1) led to NO recidivism. Not being convicted but having a drug history (Example 2) also resulted in NO. However, having more prior convictions and other factors can sometimes lead to YES outcomes, as seen in Example 3.\n\nPutting it all together: His criminal history is a significant risk factor, so I'd assign high weight to that. The lack of education might be medium. Living alone could be low or maybe medium if isolation increases risk. Work experience is positive, which would lower the risk slightly. No drug use and no depression are strong mitigators, so those would be low.\n\nConsidering all these factors: He has a prior conviction (high risk), limited education (medium risk), living alone (possibly medium risk), work history (low risk), no drugs or depression (very low risk), and a troubled past living situation (could be high or medium depending on how it's viewed). His belief in God might mitigate some of the negative aspects.\n\nI think his overall risk is somewhat high because he has that prior conviction. The other factors are mixed, but the conviction carries significant weight. So my prediction would lean towards YES with a confidence level around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior conviction for a crime, which is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"The individual does not have a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which may indicate limited opportunities for positive reintegration after incarceration.\"), \n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could be isolating and potentially increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors after release.\"), \n    (\"Work Experience\", \"low\", \"The individual has held two jobs during the past year, which may provide some stability and support to prevent relapse.\"), \n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"The individual has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive factor for reducing recidivism risk.\"), \n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"The individual has not felt depressed over the past month, indicating mental stability and reduced risk of substance abuse triggers.\"), \n    (\"Early Life Challenges\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of six could indicate a disrupted upbringing that may have contributed to criminal behavior or other destabilizing factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 6. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
