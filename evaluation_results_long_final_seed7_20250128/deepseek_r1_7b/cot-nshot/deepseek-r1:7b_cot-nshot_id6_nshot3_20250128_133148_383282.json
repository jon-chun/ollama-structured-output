    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old White male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's significant because prior convictions are usually strong predictors of future criminal behavior. In Examples #1 and #2, individuals with arrests had lower recidivism rates, but in Example #3, someone with a non-convicted arrest still had a YES outcome. However, the number of prior arrests does matter; having at least one can increase the risk.\n\nNext, his weight is 155 lbs, which falls within the normal range for his height (5'7\"). Being underweight or overweight isn't typically a direct indicator unless it's extreme, so I'd assign this a low to medium weight. His height is also average, so no major impact there.\n\nHe's living alone with no family support, which can contribute to higher stress and substance use issues. This might push his recidivism risk up but doesn't seem extremely high yet.\n\nHis education level: he has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education generally correlates with lower recidivism as it often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. However, not being enrolled in college could mean he's relying on other factors like substance use or lack of support.\n\nHe's never been married but is living alone. Marital status can influence support systems, so living alone might indicate a higher risk of isolation leading to substance abuse issues. But it's somewhat mitigated by his education and the fact that he doesn't have family nearby.\n\nHis past four-year drug use: he has used marijuana once before and now uses it weekly. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential substance abuse, which can lead to criminal behavior or further substance use. This seems like a high risk factor because even occasional use can have significant impacts on behavior.\n\nHe felt \"so down in the dumps\" during the past month. This indicates depression or low mood, which are linked to substance abuse and impulsive behaviors that might contribute to recidivism. This is another high risk factor as chronic depression can exacerbate other problematic behaviors.\n\nHis household size at a young age was 4 when he lived with his biological mother in a rural area. Larger households often have more people who can provide support, so this might slightly lower the risk compared to smaller families. However, it's not a major factor like living alone or having multiple family members present.\n\nHe doesn't believe in God and says that has nothing to do with his personal events. This could mean he lacks religious support for dealing with negative emotions, which might leave him more vulnerable to substance abuse issues since there's no divine intervention to help him cope.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest is a moderate risk factor because one conviction can increase the chances of recidivism but isn't the only determinant. Drug use and depression are both high risk factors that significantly contribute to potential future criminal behavior. Living alone, lack of family support, and not being in college also push his risk up.\n\nConsidering these points, I'm leaning towards a higher chance of recidivism. The presence of prior arrest, substance abuse, and mood issues makes the overall risk profile on the edge but likely leaning towards YES for 3-year recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior conviction which is a significant indicator of potential recidivism, though not the sole determinant.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Regular marijuana use and current substance abuse are strong indicators of potential relapse or increased criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mood Issues\", \"high\", \"chronic depression leading to negative moods can contribute to substance abuse and impulsive behaviors that may result in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without significant family support may increase stress and substance use, contributing to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college may provide some stability, though it's mitigated by other factors like drug use and mood issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White.
