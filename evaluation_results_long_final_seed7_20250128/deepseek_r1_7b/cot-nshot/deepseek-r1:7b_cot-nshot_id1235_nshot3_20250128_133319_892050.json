    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case using the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: He's 21 years old. Younger individuals might be more prone to recidivism because they're still developing their skills and relationships. So that could be a medium or high risk factor.\n\nRace: Black is noted as an identifier here. There's some inherent racial disparities in the criminal justice system, so this should definitely be considered a high risk factor.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He was arrested once but not convicted. That one prior arrest can significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism, especially if there's no conviction backing it up. So that's probably a medium or high weight.\n\nEducation level: He has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. People with less education might have fewer opportunities and could face more barriers to reintegration once released. Medium risk?\n\nEmployment history: He hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substance abuse, lack of support system, and increased chances of criminal behavior. That should be a high weight.\n\nLiving situation: Living alone is a red flag. Being an only child or living independently might mean he lacks support networks, which could contribute to higher recidivism rates. High risk factor.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can affect judgment and increase willingness to engage in risky behavior. Medium weight since the depression part is low here.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: He lived with his biological mother in a household of 7, which was urban. Larger households might not necessarily protect against recidivism but could indicate instability or neglect if that's the case. Not sure about this one; maybe medium or low risk?\n\nReligion: Doesn't consider God affecting his life as much. Some studies suggest that religious affiliation can provide support and reduce stressors, so if he doesn't feel that connection, it might increase risk. Medium.\n\nPutting it all together: High prior risk factors include race, past arrests (though not convicted), living situation, and drug use. The younger age is also a contributing factor. I'm leaning towards a higher confidence of recidivism here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young and may increase the likelihood of recidivism due to developmental factors.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Being Black may present systemic racial disparities in the criminal justice system, increasing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest but not a conviction could still pose a significant risk of reoffending if there is no support structure in place.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment history may indicate vulnerability to substance abuse and dependency, both of which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone without a support network could lead to increased stress and substance use, contributing to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years may indicate potential for increased risky behavior, though recent feelings of depression are low here.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living with an extended household might not inherently provide protective factors but could also suggest instability if that's the case.\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"medium\", \"Not considering God as a significant factor may leave him without religious support, which can be beneficial for reducing stress and stressors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
