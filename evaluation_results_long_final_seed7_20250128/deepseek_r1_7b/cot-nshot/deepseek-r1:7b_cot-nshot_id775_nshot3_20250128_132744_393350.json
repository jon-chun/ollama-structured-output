    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assign risk factors for this new case based on the examples given. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 18 years old. In Example #1, a 21-year-old had NO rearrest. Here, being younger might be associated with lower recidivism since they're still developing their skills or perhaps haven't faced the same challenges yet. So maybe this factor has a low weight.\n\nEthnicity: He's White. Looking at the examples, Example #3 was White and had a YES outcome. However, Example #2 is Black and also NO. There might be some variation here, but being White doesn't directly correlate to higher or lower risk without more context. I'll tentatively assign medium weight.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He has 1 arrest compared to Example #3's 3. More arrests generally increase recidivism risk, so this could be a medium factor pushing towards YES.\n\nConviction status: He was arrested but not convicted. In Example #2, similar stats resulted in NO. So being arrested but not convicted might indicate lower risk than someone who has been convicted. Maybe this is low weight.\n\nGender: He's male. In the examples, males had mixed outcomes. Since he's White and male, perhaps gender alone isn't a strong indicator here. I'll keep it low.\n\nHeight: 5'4\". The examples have similar heights but varying outcomes. Maybe not much impact here; assign low.\n\nWeight: 160 lbs compared to others around him. Weight can influence things like physical risk, but without more info, this is low.\n\nMarital status: Living alone, both in Examples #2 and #3. Living alone might correlate with lower risk as he's not relying on others for support, so maybe medium weight.\n\nEducation level: No HS diploma or GED. Both examples had similar levels (Examples 1, 2, 3). Lack of education can lead to higher risk but in this case, it's mixed. Assign low.\n\nEmployment history: He held 1 job last year. Example #3 had 4 jobs and YES outcome. More employment generally reduces risk, so having a job is positive. This could be high weight.\n\nDrug use: He used cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Cocaine use can lead to paraphernalia issues or other complications, which might increase risk. However, since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe this factor isn't as strong. Medium weight.\n\nLifestyle factors at a young age: He lived with his biological mother in a household of 3 in a rural area, similar to Example #3 who had YES. Being raised in a stable environment might reduce risk. Assign medium weight.\n\nGod belief: Doesn't consider God's influence. In Example #2, someone without religious belief also had NO. So maybe this factor doesn't strongly impact the outcome here. Low weight.\n\nPutting it all together, the key factors pushing towards YES are education level (low), employment history (high). The high prior arrest could be a medium. Drug use is medium but not severe. Other factors like age and height are low. Since his education was poor and he's jobless, despite being White, these negatives might outweigh positives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 18 years old, which may indicate lower recidivism risk compared to older individuals who have more life experiences that could contribute to negative outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Being White does not directly correlate with higher or lower risk without additional context about societal factors or personal background.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"Having one prior arrest, especially if not convicted, may be a minor factor contributing to recidivism risk but not the most significant.\"),\n    (\"Conviction Status\", \"low\", \"Not having been convicted despite an arrest might suggest a lower immediate risk compared to those who have been convicted.\"),\n    (\"Gender\", \"low\", \"Being male does not inherently correlate with higher or lower risk without considering other factors like education or employment history.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"The person is 5'4\\\"; height alone may not significantly influence recidivism risk unless it relates to physical health issues, which there's no indication of here.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"At 160 lbs, weight might be a factor in some recidivism assessments for health reasons, but without specific health issues, its impact is minimal.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could correlate with lower risk as it removes dependency on others who may contribute to emotional support or substance use triggers.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED does not directly correlate with recidivism but can be an indicator of potential challenges in entering the workforce or making independent choices.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding one job during the year could positively influence future stability and reduce risk factors associated with unemployment or lack of support networks.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Using cocaine in the past four years may increase risk due to potential paraphernalia issues, but not feeling depressed recently might mitigate some negative impacts.\"),\n    (\"Lifestyle Factors at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of 3 with biological mother in a rural area could correlate with lower risk due to less exposure to stressors commonly found in urban environments.\"),\n    (\"God Belief\", \"low\", \"Not considering God's influence may not directly impact recidivism unless there are broader societal factors at play, which are not indicated here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
