    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've been given this query where the user is asking for a criminal justice risk assessment. They provided three example cases with their respective risk factors and outcomes over a three-year period. Now, they want me to analyze another case based on those examples.\n\nFirst, let me try to understand what each factor contributes in the examples. Looking at Example 1, it's a Hispanic male who was arrested once, convicted, and so on. The outcome was NO rearrest. Similarly, Example 2 is Black, not convicted, living alone, no job, etc., also resulted in NO. But Example 3 had more factors like drug use and some negative mood, leading to YES.\n\nSo the user wants me to assign a relative weight (low, medium, high) to each risk factor for their new case and then predict the outcome with confidence.\n\nThe new case is a 20-year-old Black female. She's been arrested six times, convicted, which seems severe. Her height and weight are average but not particularly concerning. She's living alone, no job, no education, drug use (marijuana), and severe mood issues this month. She lived with her mother in a household of four in an urban area.\n\nI'll go through each factor:\n\n1. Age: 20 is quite young for recidivism, usually lower risk.\n2. Hispanic origin: Example 1 was Hispanic but outcome was NO. However, the user's case isn't Hispanic; it's Black female.\n3. Number of arrests and convictions: Six arrests, all convictions\u2014that's a high risk factor. The example with six arrests had a YES in Example 3 due to drug use and mood issues.\n4. Height/weight: Doesn't seem directly related.\n5. Marital status: Living alone is slightly concerning but not the most significant unless combined with other factors.\n6. Education: No HS diploma or GED, which is low education\u2014typically higher risk for recidivism.\n7. Employment: No jobs held in a year; unemployment could lead to dependency and more crimes.\n8. Drug use: She uses marijuana weekly and had severe mood issues this month, similar to Example 3's outcome of YES.\n\nPutting it all together, the key factors pushing her towards higher risk are the multiple arrests (high), lack of education (low but perhaps medium when combined with other negatives?), no job (medium), severe drug use (high) especially coupled with mood issues. The fact that she's Black doesn't directly contribute as much in this case since Example 2 had a Black male without similar outcomes.\n\nI think her overall risk is high because of the multiple arrests, lack of education and employment, and severe substance abuse and mood issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 20 years old, which is relatively young for recidivism.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
