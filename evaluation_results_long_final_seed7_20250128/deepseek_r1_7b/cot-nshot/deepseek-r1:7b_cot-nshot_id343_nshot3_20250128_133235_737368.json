    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk assessment case for a 19-year-old White male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which might indicate he's still developing, so maybe that's a low risk factor. He has no prior convictions but one arrest, which could be a medium concern since he's been stopped before but hasn't been convicted yet.\n\nHis physical attributes: 6 feet tall and 165 lbs aren't particularly concerning unless they relate to substance use or health issues, which don't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's living alone with no family support. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates due to isolation but might also depend on other factors like having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college, which are positive signs.\n\nHis education level: High school diploma and enrolled in college shows he has some commitment to further education, reducing the risk of substance abuse or lack of stability. That's probably a medium factor.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs in the past year. Having work experience can help with stability and financial independence, so this is likely a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana four years ago but hasn't felt depressed recently. Since he's not currently using drugs, maybe that's a low risk compared to factors like substance abuse history or ongoing issues.\n\nLiving situation at age: Household size 6 with both parents in an urban area might indicate a stable home environment initially, though it's now living alone. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with different risk profiles due to various social dynamics.\n\nHis belief in God as affecting his life is a positive factor since religious support can contribute to personal well-being and stability, so that's probably low risk.\n\nPutting all these together: He's relatively young but has no prior convictions, good education, stable living situation (though currently alone), limited substance use issues, and a supportive religious background. These factors lean towards lower recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which suggests he is still developing and may have more capacity for positive development.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"He has one prior arrest but no prior convictions, indicating he has been stopped before but not convicted.\"),\n    (\"Physical Attributes\", \"low\", \"His height (6 feet) and weight (165 lbs) do not correlate with substance use or health issues as per the provided information.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"He currently lives alone without a family support network, which can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism rates but may also indicate personal responsibility.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, indicating a commitment to further education and potentially better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Work Experience\", \"low\", \"He has held 3 jobs in the past year, suggesting stability and financial independence which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"He used marijuana four years ago but has not felt depressed recently; no ongoing substance use issues contribute to lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Age of Arrest\", \"medium\", \"At age 19, he lived with both parents in a household of six in an urban area.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
