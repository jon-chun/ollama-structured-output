    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old Black male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once and convicted. That seems like a significant risk factor because prior convictions are strongly associated with higher chances of rearrest. So that's a high weight.\n\nHe weighs 195 lbs at 5'5\". Weight can be a concern in recidivism assessment, but I don't see any other factors related to his weight or diet, so maybe medium weight here.\n\nDivorced and not living alone might indicate instability, which could increase risk. But since he's 21, it's still early in his life, so perhaps the impact isn't as high as if he were in a later stage. Medium again.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED is concerning because educational attainment is a key predictor of recidivism. Not having this might mean he's less likely to get better job opportunities that could help him avoid trouble. High weight here.\n\nNot enrolled in college fits with the previous point about education. It's another medium factor, as lack of education and not attending college are both negative indicators.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year. Job tenure is important; having a stable job can reduce recidivism. Short job history might mean he hasn't had enough time to build up skills or stability. Medium weight.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years, which is positive\u2014substance abuse is a major factor. So that's low risk from this aspect.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of mental health issues could be protective. Low here.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of four in an urban area at age 15. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but since he's not been convicted yet, maybe it's a medium risk because living in a larger household might imply more social support or less isolation, which could mitigate some negative effects.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014positive reinforcement, so that's low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior conviction is high. Education and job history are medium negatives. Everything else is either neutral or positive. So the overall prediction leans towards YES, but since prior conviction is a strong indicator, maybe with some mitigating factors, the confidence is around 60%.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for this case, here's a structured evaluation:\n\n- **Risk Factors Weighting**:\n    - **Conviction**: High (The fact that he has been convicted once significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest.)\n    - **Education Level**: Medium (Lack of high school diploma/GED is moderate but not as impactful without job stability.)\n    - **Employment History**: Medium (Only one job held may indicate instability or limited opportunities.)\n    - **Living Situation**: Medium (Divorced status and living with his mother in a larger household could have mixed effects on support systems.)\n    - **Mental Health**: Low (No depression reported, which is positive.)\n    - **Drug Use**: Low (No drug use history, which is favorable.)\n    - **Household Size at Age 15**: Medium (Living with multiple family members might offer some protective factors but not entirely mitigating risk.)\n\n- **Prediction and Confidence**:\n    Considering the high weight of prior conviction and moderate impact from other factors like education and employment, the model predicts a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, the positive aspects such as no drug use and mental health indicators slightly mitigate this risk.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted once, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and increased likelihood of future arrests.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED indicates lower educational attainment, which can be a risk factor but without direct job involvement data, it's moderate\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Only one job held during the year may indicate limited stability or opportunities that could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_status\", \"medium\", \"Divorced status and living with his biological mother in a household of four suggest mixed family support factors which can have both protective and risk aspects\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported over the past month indicates positive mental health, which is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates a clean record, which is favorable for reducing rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"household_size_at_age_15\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents and a household size of four at age 15 may offer some support but does not entirely mitigate risk factors related to family dynamics or living environment which could influence behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 195 lbs. He is divorced and is currently not living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
