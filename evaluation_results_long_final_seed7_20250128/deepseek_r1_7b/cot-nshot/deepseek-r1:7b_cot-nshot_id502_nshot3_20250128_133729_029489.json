    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I need to evaluate each risk factor for the given individual and then determine their overall recidivism outcome.\n\nFirst, age: She's 20 years old. Generally, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing skills and relationships. But since she hasn't been convicted yet, maybe her potential is lower? I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nEthnicity: White. From the examples, White individuals in similar situations didn't always have consistent outcomes, but it's a factor to consider. It might not be the highest or lowest risk on its own.\n\nArrests: 1 time, not convicted. This suggests she hasn't been given significant consequences, which could indicate lower recidivism. So maybe low risk here.\n\nGender: Female. Females typically have lower rearrest rates than males, so this is a protective factor. Low risk.\n\nWeight: Between 175-199 lbs. Overweight can be a risk factor due to health issues, but she's not morbidly obese. I'll consider this as medium risk because while weight isn't the biggest issue, it's still something to note.\n\nMarital status: Living alone with no children, which is usually protective against certain crimes. So low risk here.\n\nEducation: High school diploma, not enrolled in college. Education tends to lower recidivism, so low risk.\n\nEmployment: Held 2 jobs during the year. Employment, especially gainful employment, is strongly associated with lower recidivism. Low risk.\n\nDrug use: Past four years she used marijuana and some feelings of depression. Substance abuse can increase recidivism risk because of potential relapse or continued substance use in the future. So medium to high risk here.\n\nLiving situation at a young age: Lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, rural area. Being raised by family, especially in a stable environment, usually reduces risk factors. Low risk.\n\nGod involvement: She believes God has something to do with her life. This positive belief is often linked to better outcomes and personal accountability, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards lower recidivism. The only significant risk is from drug use and some uncertainty about past depression. Overall, I think the risk of rearrest in three years is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 20 years old, which may indicate higher potential for developing skills and relationships, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, this factor might be lower compared to others.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being White, although a factor in previous examples that didn't always show consistent outcomes, her race is not the primary determinant of recidivism in this case.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
