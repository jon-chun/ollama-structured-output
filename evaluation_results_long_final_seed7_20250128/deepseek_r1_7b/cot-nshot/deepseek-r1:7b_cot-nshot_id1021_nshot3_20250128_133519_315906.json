    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case for a 20-year-old Hispanic male who has been arrested 10 times with convictions. He's living alone at home size 6 in an urban area. His behavior includes drug use (marijuana and cocaine) but no recent depression. Other factors like education, jobs held, and family background.\n\nLooking at the examples provided:\n\nExample #1: A Hispanic male, less severe offense, married, better job history, no drug use, no prior issues leading to a NO outcome.\n\nExample #2: Black male, first-time arrest, living alone with mother in urban area, no drugs or depression. Also a NO outcome.\n\nExample #3: White male, multiple arrests without convictions, drug user, some depression, rural living\u2014resulted in YES.\n\nComparing these, being Hispanic might not be a strong risk factor here because he's White in the example that did have a recidivism, but his own background is relevant.\n\nHis 10 prior arrests and convictions are significant; that's high compared to the examples. His drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is present, which can increase risk. Living alone suggests possible isolation or higher risk of substance abuse leading to further issues.\n\nConsidering he hasn't felt depressed in the past month but has a history of drug use could indicate ongoing instability. The urban area might mean better access to support services, but living with his mother in a household of 6 isn't ideal for independence.\n\nEducation and not being enrolled in college is a positive factor that can aid in getting help. Not holding any jobs aligns with a person needing more support, which could be a risk if he doesn't seek it up.\n\nPutting this together: The high number of arrests (10) would likely indicate a higher risk. Drug use and living situation may amplify that risk despite positive factors like being Hispanic and not having a family of his own but still with family nearby. However, the lack of job experience and education might suggest he's more likely to find support if needed.\n\nSo overall, I'd weigh his prior arrests as high, drug use as medium (since it's present), living alone as medium-high due to potential isolation or lack of support, lack of education as low, and perhaps no jobs held as medium. The family background might temper some risk factors but doesn't negate the others.\n\nTherefore, with these weighted factors leaning towards higher risk for recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of 10 arrests and convictions, which is significantly higher than in the provided examples.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic.
