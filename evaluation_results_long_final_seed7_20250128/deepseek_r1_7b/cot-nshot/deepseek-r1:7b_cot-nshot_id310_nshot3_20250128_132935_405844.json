    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case using the given examples. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 19 years old. From Example #2, a similar age with no convictions had an outcome of NO. But in Example #3, someone who was 19 but hadn't been convicted yet also got NO. So being 19 might not be a strong risk factor on its own.\n\nEthnicity: He's White. In Example #3, the person was White and had similar factors leading to YES. But in Examples #2 and #1, White wasn't mentioned as an outcome variable, so maybe it's less relevant here.\n\nNumber of arrests: He's been arrested once and convicted. Examples with one arrest but no conviction all resulted in NO, except when there were more arrests without convictions still being NO. So one arrest with a conviction might be a moderate risk factor.\n\nConviction: He was convicted once. In Example #3, someone with three arrests but no conviction had YES, so having a conviction could actually lower the risk compared to multiple arrests without convictions.\n\nGender: He's male. The examples don't specify gender as a factor, so I'll ignore it for now.\n\nWeight and height: 5'8\" and 193 lbs. No clear trend in Example #2 or #3 regarding weight, but maybe being heavy isn't directly correlated here.\n\nMarital status: He's living alone. In all examples, people living with others had NO outcomes, so living alone might be a positive factor.\n\nEducation level: He doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't in college. In Example #3, someone without a diploma had YES, but that person also used drugs more heavily. So education could be a risk factor if he's not enrolled.\n\nJob history: He held 3 jobs during the year. Example #2 had no job history with NO outcome, so having some work might be good.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and hasn't felt depressed recently. In Example #3, drug use was moderate (marijuana and cocaine), which led to YES, but here he only used marijuana. Maybe less severe drug use is better.\n\nHousehold size: He lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of 5 in an urban area. In Example #2, living with five adults in the city had NO outcome, so larger households might be safer environments.\n\nGod belief: He believes God has something to do with his life. In Example #3, he didn't believe and still got YES, but here he does believe. Belief can sometimes correlate with better outcomes if it's a support system, but I'm not sure how strong that is in this context.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Arrests: One conviction (high risk)\n- Drug use: Low to moderate\n- Education: No diploma (moderate risk)\n- Marital status: Alone (good sign)\n- Job history: Some work (good sign)\n- Household size: Large urban household (good sign)\n- God belief: Believes in God (positive but not sure)\n\nThe strongest factors are convictions and lack of education, which might increase the risk. However, living alone, having some job experience, and a supportive belief in God could offset those risks. So maybe the risk is medium to high.\n\nSince Example #3 had three arrests without conviction leading to YES, this person with one conviction but no other factors might be closer to that outcome. But he also has positive factors like living alone and job history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual was arrested once and had a conviction, which is a moderate risk factor as seen in similar cases where such outcomes led to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate significantly increases the risk of recidivism compared to those with education levels that are not available or lower than this individual's situation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use Frequency\", \"low\", \"Moderate drug use (marijuana) was noted, which is less severe and may have a mitigating effect on recidivism outcomes compared to more frequent or heavier substance use as seen in other cases.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone is associated with lower recidivism rates compared to those living with others, indicating this factor reduces the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Job History\", \"medium\", \"Having held 3 jobs during the year provides some stability and could be a mitigating factor in reducing recidivism risk compared to individuals with no job experience or inconsistent employment history.\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Composition\", \"low\", \"Living in a larger urban household with non-biological parents is associated with lower recidivism rates, possibly due to less direct supervision and different living conditions that may reduce stress and exposure to risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Believing in God was noted as a positive factor potentially indicating better life choices or support systems, which could help mitigate the risk of recidivism compared to those who do not hold such beliefs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 193 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
