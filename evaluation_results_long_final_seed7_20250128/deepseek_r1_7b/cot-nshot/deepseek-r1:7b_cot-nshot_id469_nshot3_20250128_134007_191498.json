    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old White male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. From the examples, being arrested even if not convicted can be a significant factor because it shows some involvement with the legal system, which might indicate past behavior issues.\n\nHis weight is 158 lbs at 6 feet 1 inch. I don't know if that's relevant here since weight isn't typically a direct risk factor in recidivism assessments unless there's an issue like obesity, but no mention of health problems, so maybe low impact.\n\nHe's living alone with never been married and has a high school diploma not enrolled in college. Living situation can be associated with higher stress or instability, which might contribute to substance use or other issues\u2014so medium weight.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year. Having multiple stable jobs is usually positive as it shows responsibility, so maybe low impact here.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can lead to other problems, but no recent depression suggests he might be managing it okay\u2014so medium risk there.\n\nHousehold size at a young age was 5, which is large, possibly indicating family issues or living with extended relatives\u2014could contribute to behavioral issues\u2014medium weight.\n\nConsidering God's role\u2014he believes something positive about it. This might indicate a more proactive outlook but could also relate to other factors if he's struggling with personal issues.\n\nPutting it all together: He has one arrest, which is moderate risk because even non-convicted can lead to reoffending. Medium drug use and living situation contribute some risk, while multiple jobs are positive. His family background isn't too bad but could have issues. Since the previous outcomes were NO for similar factors, maybe he's low risk this time.\n\nSo overall, I'd say his chance is low for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (not convicted)\", \"medium\", \"Being arrested even without a conviction can indicate past involvement with the legal system and may suggest potential behavioral issues that could lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana, no recent depression)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use, especially if accompanied by periods of low mood, can sometimes be linked to underlying mental health issues or substance abuse problems which may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone (never married)\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently indicate a high risk but could potentially lead to stress or instability depending on the circumstances.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 158 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
