    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. Let me start by going through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 18 years old. In Example #2, someone who's 19 and Black with similar factors had a NO outcome. Being younger might be associated with lower recidivism since they're still developing, but other factors could influence this.\n\nEthnicity: He's Black, like in Examples #2 and #3. Example #2 outcome was NO, so maybe being Black isn't a strong risk factor here.\n\nArrests: He has been arrested 3 times but not convicted. In Example #1 and #2, those with more arrests had NO outcomes, even though they were not convicted. So three arrests could be a moderate to high risk.\n\nWeight: He weighs 195 lbs, which is on the higher side. In Examples, weight didn't seem to play a big role directly, but maybe in other contexts it matters.\n\nHeight: 6 feet 6 inches. Taller individuals might have different dynamics at work or social settings, but again, not sure how that affects recidivism here.\n\nMarital status: He's living alone, like Examples #2 and #3. Living alone isn't a clear risk factor from the examples; they were all living with someone.\n\nEducation: He's enrolled in school now, unlike Example #1 where he wasn't enrolled but had a high school diploma. Being in school might indicate better opportunities or less involvement in criminal activities, so maybe low risk here.\n\nJobs held: He has 1 job during the year. More stable income could reduce recidivism, but Examples show people with 4 jobs still had NO outcomes, so having at least one job is positive.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a sign of underlying issues, but he hasn't used heavily in the past four years, which might be good.\n\nHousehold size at young age: He lived with his biological mother in a household of 7 in an urban area. Larger households sometimes have different dynamics, but again, not sure how that ties to recidivism directly from the examples.\n\nGod involvement: He believes God has something to do with his life, similar to Example #1 and #3 where God was involved. This might indicate stability or positivity, which could lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: He's Black (not a clear risk factor), 3 arrests but no convictions, so maybe high risk from that. Weight is on the higher side but not sure about its impact here. He's 18, younger than the examples, which had NO outcomes. Education-wise, he's in school, which might be positive. Jobs held: 1 job, which could help. Drug use seems controlled.\n\nSo considering all factors, his main risk is from past arrests without convictions and his age being 18. Height isn't a big issue here. God involvement and living alone don't add much risk. So overall, I'd say high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 18 years old, which is younger than the examples provided, suggesting potentially lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black ethnicity was a factor in Example #2 with no outcome, but it alone doesn't consistently indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"Three arrests without convictions significantly increase the risk of recidivism compared to examples where fewer arrests led to no outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"195 lbs is within a typical range and hasn't been shown to directly correlate with higher recidivism in the examples.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"6 feet 6 inches, which doesn't show a clear association with recidivism in the given context.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone isn't explicitly stated as a risk factor but was present in some examples without outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in school indicates proactive steps towards better opportunities and reduced involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Jobs Held\", \"low\", \"Held 1 job, which can contribute positively to stability and reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Used marijuana recently but hasn't felt depressed, indicating controlled behavior which is favorable.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived with a household of 7, which may have different dynamics but wasn't explicitly linked to higher risk in the examples.\"),\n    (\"God Involvement\", \"low\", \"Believes God has something to do with his life, indicating stability and positivity that could lower risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 6 inches and weighs 195 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
