    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by reviewing the examples provided to understand how each factor contributes to rearrest outcomes.\n\nIn Example #1, a 21-year-old Hispanic male with one arrest and conviction had no recidivism after three years. Factors like being married, having a high school diploma, and living with his spouse were protective. His drug use was past four years, which is positive, and he didn't feel depressed recently.\n\nIn Example #2, a 19-year-old Black male without prior convictions but living alone had no rearrest. Not having a GED and not being employed might be negative, but since he wasn't convicted or arrested again, it's a clean outcome.\n\nExample #3 was different\u2014a White male with three arrests who did recidivate. His drug use (marijuana and cocaine) and feeling down were significant factors leading to a YES outcome.\n\nNow, looking at the case to predict:\n\n- Age: 19 years old. Younger individuals might have more time for mistakes.\n- Race: Black. Historically, recidivism rates can be higher based on systemic issues, but this isn't absolute.\n- Arrests: 1 time, not convicted. Prior non-conviction is positive.\n- Height/Weight: 5'7\"/140 lbs. Not directly related to risk unless considering if he's in a situation that could lead to stress, which doesn't seem here.\n- Single parent living alone: Living alone can be isolating and may increase stress or substance use.\n- GED: Holds one. Having a GED is usually associated with better job opportunities and lower recidivism.\n- Employed 2 jobs: Being employed for two years might indicate stable life circumstances, which are protective.\n- No drug use in past four years: Clean record is positive.\n- Not feeling depressed: No recent negative emotions that could contribute to substance abuse or neglect.\n\nConsidering the risk factors:\n\n- Age: Low. At 19, some risk but also potential for positive changes.\n- Race: Medium. While race can influence outcomes due to societal factors, this case has mitigating factors like a GED and not being in a high-risk environment.\n- Arrests: Medium. One non-convicted arrest\u2014can be a sign of good behavior but doesn't guarantee stability.\n- Living alone: Low to medium risk. Being single might lead to isolation, which could have negative effects.\n- Employment history: High. Employed two jobs suggests responsible behavior and positive life choices.\n- Drug use: Low (no recent use). Clean record is protective.\n- Depression: Low (not feeling depressed). Positive mental state.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nThe individual has a mix of factors. The presence of a GED and stable employment could outweigh some negative aspects like living alone or being single, especially at 19 years old. However, the one prior arrest without conviction is still present but not severe. His positive indicators (GED, job history) suggest he might be on a path to stability.\n\nBut considering he's Black, there's a base association with higher recidivism rates in some studies, though this case has mitigating factors. The lack of drug use and no recent depression also help.\n\nSo, the overall risk is medium but leaning towards lower because of positive life choices and education. However, given his age and race, it might still be on the higher end.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which presents a window for potential mistakes but also indicates a younger, potentially more adaptable individual.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"While race can influence recidivism rates due to systemic factors, this case has mitigating factors like a GED and stable employment.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One non-convicted arrest suggests good behavior but does not guarantee long-term stability.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 19 could lead to isolation; however, it may also indicate responsible living without significant stressors\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Employed two jobs for a year indicates stable life circumstances and positive choices which are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a strong indicator of substance abuse prevention and positivity in lifestyle.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests a positive mental state without recent triggers for negative emotions\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 2. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
