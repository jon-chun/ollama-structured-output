    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this case based on the provided risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: 20 years old. The examples have people around 19-21, but since this person is younger, maybe his age isn't a strong factor here, so probably low weight.\n\nRace: White. In Example #3, another White person had a higher risk (Outcome YES), while the Hispanic in Example #1 had no recidivism. So being White might be a medium to high risk factor depending on context.\n\nNumber of prior arrests and convictions: 5 arrests, but none convicted. That's different from the examples where arrest counts are lower. More past negative interactions could increase risk, so maybe high weight.\n\nHeight and weight: 6ft0, 165 lbs. Doesn't seem directly related to recidivism in these examples, so probably low.\n\nLiving situation: Living alone since never married. This is similar to Example #2 where someone living alone had no outcome, but in that case, he was Black with no prior arrests. Here, it's White with more past issues, so maybe medium.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED. Similar to the Black and White examples without convictions, which didn't lead to recidivism in their cases. So low weight here.\n\nJob experience: Held 4 jobs during the year. The examples have people who held jobs but no arrests had higher risk (Example #3). This person has a stable job history, so maybe medium weight.\n\nDrug use: Past four years of marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates in general, so this should be high weight.\n\nMental health: Felt down during the month. The White example had similar feelings but no recidivism. Here, it's more severe, which might increase risk. So medium to high.\n\nHousehold size at young age: 4 people. Example #1 had a household of 7 and no recidivism, while Example #3 was smaller (3) with higher risk. Maybe larger households can provide support, but in this case, the person is still alone now, so maybe low weight for household size.\n\nGod involvement: The White person here believes God has something to do with his life. This might suggest a more stable environment or personal factors that could either help or hinder. Since it's positive but not directly tied to recidivism in examples, perhaps medium weight.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrests and convictions (high), drug use (high), mental health issues (medium high). Education and living situation are low. Age is low.\n\nSo the high risk factors would dominate, leading to a YES prediction with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 20 years old, which is slightly younger than the examples provided, so this factor has a low weight.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Being White may increase recidivism risk, as seen in Example #3, but it's context-dependent and thus assigned medium weight.\"),\n    (\"Number of prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Five prior arrests with no convictions significantly increase the risk of recidivism compared to examples where arrest counts were lower.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"He is 6 feet 0 inches, which doesn't directly correlate with recidivism in these examples, so this factor has a low weight.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone since never married, similar to Example #2 but with additional prior issues, leading to medium weight.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate and not enrolled in college, which is consistent with the examples and thus low weight.\"),\n    (\"Job experience\", \"medium\", \"Held 4 jobs during the year; stability can reduce risk but it's not directly tied to recidivism in these cases, so medium weight.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine for four years, which strongly correlates with higher recidivism rates, leading to high weight.\"),\n    (\"Mental health\", \"medium-high\", \"Felt down during the past month; this is similar to Example #1 but more severely affecting his mood, so medium-high weight.\"),\n    (\"Household size at young age\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of size 4 at a young age, which might provide some support compared to larger households, leading to low weight.\"),\n    (\"God involvement\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has something to do with his life; this is a positive factor but not directly tied to recidivism outcomes, so medium weight\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
