    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old White male. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19, which might mean he's still developing skills and has fewer life experiences. That could be a low risk factor because younger individuals often have more potential and less criminal history.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can sometimes indicate that there were no serious charges or maybe he was released soon after. This might point towards lower recidivism, so I'd assign this as low risk.\n\nHis weight is 140 lbs, which isn't particularly high or low. No information on BMI, but generally, weight alone doesn't predict much without more context.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone, which can be a neutral factor. Living alone doesn't inherently increase or decrease risk unless combined with other factors like substance use.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is typically linked to lower recidivism as higher education often leads to better job opportunities and financial stability. So this would be low risk.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs during the year, which shows employability. Job experience usually correlates with reduced time behind bars or rearrest. So that's a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. drug use can have significant negative impacts on employment, relationships, and overall stability. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, it might suggest some coping mechanisms or personal resilience, which could somewhat mitigate the risk but still be medium to high depending on other factors.\n\nHe lived with both parents at a young age in a household of 4 in a rural area. A stable home environment can contribute positively to recidivism rates, so this would be low risk as long as there are no underlying issues that might have led to the arrests.\n\nHis belief in God is stated, which could indicate a higher likelihood of staying within the legal system or seeking help through religious channels, thus lowering the risk. This seems like a high positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together: most factors lean towards low risk with some medium influences from drug use and living situation. The overall confidence is moderate because while many factors are negative (like arrest history), others indicate good stability and support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which typically indicates a period of high potential with fewer life experiences that could correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History (Not Convicted)\", \"low\", \"One non-convicted arrest suggests limited criminal history and possibly easier transition post-arrest given no significant legal consequences.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"A BMI of 20.7 is within the healthy range, suggesting good physical health which can correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"neutral\", \"Living alone without a spouse doesn't inherently suggest high or low risk but should be considered in conjunction with other factors like substance use and family history\"),\n    (\"Education Level (High School Diploma)\", \"low\", \"A high school diploma is associated with better job prospects, financial stability, and reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Two job holdings during the year suggest employability, which often correlates with lower rearrest rates as individuals can maintain income support and stability\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Marijuana/Cocaine in Past 4 Years)\", \"medium\", \"Substance use history can impact employment, relationships, and stability but not feeling depressed recently suggests some coping mechanisms that might mitigate risk but don't guarantee a low risk outcome\"),\n    (\"Family History (Household of Size 4, Rural Area)\", \"low\", \"Living with both parents in a household of four could indicate a stable family environment which is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief (God's Influence)\", \"high\", \"Believing in God can provide a sense of direction and ethical guidance which may contribute to staying within the legal system or seeking help, thus reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
