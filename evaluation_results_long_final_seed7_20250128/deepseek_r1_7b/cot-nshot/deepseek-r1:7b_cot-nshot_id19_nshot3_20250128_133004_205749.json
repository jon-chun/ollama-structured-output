    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether this person will be rearrested within three years. Let me look at the case details.\n\nFirst, his age is 20, which is pretty young for someone with four prior arrests. Age can sometimes predict recidivism because younger individuals might have less life experience and higher risk of making impulsive decisions again.\n\nHe's White, which I think in some studies has been linked to lower recidivism rates, but it really depends on other factors too. He's been arrested four times but not convicted\u2014wait, actually, the example says he has been convicted? Let me check: \"has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted.\" Oh, so that means he did get a conviction this time around.\n\nHis height is 5'6\", weight 135 lbs. That doesn't seem like an outlier in terms of recidivism; weight can vary widely among people regardless of risk factors.\n\nHe's living alone with no spouse or partner, which might indicate he's not getting support to stay out of trouble. Living situation could influence his access to resources and family for help after arrest.\n\nHigh school diploma but not enrolled in college\u2014maybe some people use this as an indicator of stability, but others might see it differently. It could mean he has other obligations or maybe is looking to improve himself through education.\n\nHe's held five jobs in the past year. Having multiple job experiences can sometimes be a positive because it shows stability and ability to work on his own. But if he was involved in criminal activity at any of those times, that might not hold true.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. That's a significant risk factor for recidivism because drug use can lead to substance abuse problems, which are linked to higher arrest rates and more severe offenses. Plus, it can affect judgment and decision-making abilities.\n\nHis mood is really low\u2014he felt so down that he couldn't cheer himself up at all during the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are strong predictors of recidivism because untreated mental health problems can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a household of four in an urban area when young. Urban environments might have different social dynamics compared to rural areas, but having multiple family members around could provide support and stability. However, living with family doesn't necessarily protect against arrest if other factors are present.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal happenings is a strong factor. If someone views their life as chaotic or without divine guidance, they might be more prone to making impulsive or risky decisions when they're released from incarceration.\n\nPutting this all together: He's young but with multiple prior arrests and convictions, which are concerning. His drug use and low mood increase the risk of relapse. Living alone can isolate him, potentially leading to more criminal activity once released. His lack of religious belief might contribute to a lack of accountability or support system after arrest.\n\nWhile some factors like his education and not being married might have protective effects, others like prior convictions, drug use, and low mood are much stronger indicators of high risk for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"This person is 20 years old, which can be a concerning indicator of recidivism due to youth often associated with higher risk decisions.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Four prior arrests with one conviction indicates significant criminal history, increasing the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine over the past four years is strongly linked to substance abuse and potential relapse issues.\"),\n    (\"Mood\", \"high\", \"Sustained low mood for a month can contribute to mental health issues, which are predictive of recidivism due to possible poor decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce family support but does not eliminate the risk of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment might indicate limited opportunities or responsibilities that could affect stability.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Five jobs suggest some level of stability, though past involvement with criminal activity during these times is a concern.\"),\n    (\"Family History and Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in an urban area may offer some support but doesn't protect against arrest if other factors are present.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 5 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
