    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate the risk factors for this 20-year-old male and predict his 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me start by looking at each factor in detail.\n\nFirst, he's a White male with 6 arrests but no convictions. That seems like a significant point. High number of prior arrests without convictions can increase the risk because it shows inconsistent legal behavior, which might indicate other issues or unstable situations.\n\nNext, his height and weight are listed as 5'6\" and 145 lbs. I don't know if these factors are relevant here, but maybe combined with other stats like drug use could matter, though they aren't directly mentioned for this case.\n\nHe's never married and living alone, which might suggest he's not in a stable environment. Single status can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates because of possible lack of support or increased vulnerability to external stressors.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education often correlates with lower job opportunities, which can contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors that might lead to recidivism.\n\nNumber of jobs held: He's had 3 jobs during the year. While working can help support oneself, having a history of unemployment for extended periods (as he has from prior arrests) could indicate instability.\n\nDrug use is extensive\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and currently feeling very down. drug use, especially with substances that impair judgment like cocaine, can lead to impulsive decisions and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or substance abuse again, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe lived with non-biological parents in a household of five in an urban area at age young. Large households often have more people who might not be supportive, leading to stress or neglect, which could affect his stability and willingness to engage positively in society.\n\nHis belief that God has something to do with his personal happenings is interesting. This could relate to his spiritual support system but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism unless it affects his motivation towards positive behavior, though if he's currently struggling mentally, this might not be as supportive.\n\nPutting this all together: He has a history of multiple arrests without convictions, which suggests past instability. His living situation in an urban area with non-biological parents and a large household could contribute to stress or lack of support. Drug use is extensive and current feelings of low mood indicate possible substance abuse issues, which can impede his ability to function positively.\n\nAdditionally, despite having 6 arrests, no convictions might suggest he hasn't been held accountable for serious crimes, which could point towards behavioral issues that aren't being addressed, potentially leading to more issues in the future. His lack of education and job stability also make him a risk factor for engaging in risky or illegal activities.\n\nConsidering all these high-risk factors\u2014multiple prior arrests, living circumstances, drug use, lack of education and employment\u2014the likelihood of rearrest is quite high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested six times without any convictions, indicating inconsistent legal behavior which could suggest instability or behavioral issues that may recur.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Living with non-biological parents in a household of five in an urban area, potentially leading to stress or lack of support which could affect his stability and willingness to engage positively in society.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Excessive use of marijuana and cocaine, combined with current feelings of low mood, may contribute to substance abuse issues that can impede positive behavior and increase the risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED along with not enrolling in college indicates limited opportunities and could lead to unstable employment situations contributing to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held only three jobs during the year, which may suggest periods of unemployment that can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors over time.\"),\n    (\"Mood State\", \"high\", \"Feeling very down in the dumps consistently could indicate potential mental health issues or lack of motivation, both of which may affect his ability to function positively and deter him from engaging in positive activities or seeking help.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
