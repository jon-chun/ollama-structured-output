    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. Let's start by looking at the given examples to understand how they were evaluated.\n\nIn Example #1, the person is a Hispanic male with one prior arrest, living with his spouse, high school diploma, and some drug use but no depression in the past month. The outcome was NO rearrest within three years.\n\nExample #2 is similar but non-convicted, living alone, without a diploma, no jobs, and negative factors\u2014outcome also NO.\n\nExample #3 has more prior arrests, drug use (both marijuana and cocaine), some negative mood, and living with parents in a rural area. The outcome was YES.\n\nNow, the case to predict is a 21-year-old White male with one arrest, not convicted, taller and heavier, living alone, high school diploma, two jobs, heavy drug use (marijuana) but recent positive mood, and lived with both parents in an urban household of five. He believes God affects his life.\n\nFirst, I'll list the risk factors from the example cases:\n\n1. Age: 21 vs. 19 or 21. Not sure how age affects it, maybe higher risk if too young.\n2. Hispanic vs. White\u2014different ethnic backgrounds might have different recidivism rates.\n3. Prior arrests: 1 prior arrest (non-convicted) vs. 0 in example 2 and 3. One prior arrest is moderate risk.\n4. Employment: Employed vs. not employed (example 2 had none, this has two jobs).\n5. Drug use: Past four years (marijuana only), recent positive mood if any\u2014this person used but felt better.\n6. Household size: 7 in example 1, 5 in example 3; this person is in a household of 5.\n7. Religiosity: Examples had different views on God's role.\n\nNow assigning weights based on the examples:\n\n- Age: 21 vs previous cases\u2014maybe medium risk because it's a prime age but not necessarily high unless more factors.\n- Ethnicity: White might have lower risk compared to Hispanic in example 1, so maybe low or medium.\n- Prior arrests: One non-convicted arrest is moderate (medium).\n- Employment: Employed two jobs; this could be positive as employment can reduce recidivism.\n- Drug use: Past four years of marijuana\u2014moderate. Recent positive mood might indicate improvement but also ongoing issues.\n- Household size: 5, which was in example 3 leading to YES, so maybe medium risk because being with both parents could offer support.\n- Religiosity: Believes God affects life positively\u2014but this can be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAge is around 21\u2014maybe high if considered as a decision-making age but not too old. Ethnicity White might have lower risk, so maybe low. Prior arrest medium. Employment positive (high). Drug use moderate (medium), recent mood positive might offset slightly. Household size in an urban area with both parents could be medium because support is present. Religiosity might add a protective factor\u2014so high.\n\nCollectively, the factors point towards higher risk but not certain. The positive aspects like employment and maybe some support from family could moderate it down. However, prior arrest and drug use are significant negatives. Considering all these, I'd lean towards a NO outcome with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The person is 21 years old, which can be considered as an older age for decision-making in some contexts, potentially influencing risk.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White ethnicity may have a lower recidivism rate compared to Hispanic individuals based on the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest but not convicted, indicating moderate risk as per the examples with similar cases having NO outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Held two jobs during the year, which can positively influence recidivism risk by providing stability and opportunities for positive changes.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in past four years but felt positive most of the month; this is a moderate risk factor as per examples with similar cases having NO outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Location\", \"medium\", \"Lived alone in an urban area with both parents, which may offer some support but also risks associated with living environment.\"),\n    (\"Religiosity\", \"high\", \"Believes God has something to do with his life; this could be a protective factor against recidivism as per the examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 253 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
