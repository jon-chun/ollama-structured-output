    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case based on the examples provided. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 21. In the examples, being a teenager (Examples 1 and 2) didn't lead to rearrests, but being older like in Example 3 might have some influence. I'm not sure about this yet.\n\nEthnicity: Black. Looking at Examples 2 and 3, which are also Black or Hispanic, their outcomes were NO and YES respectively. So it's mixed, maybe medium risk.\n\nNumber of arrests: He has been arrested twice but not convicted. In the examples, higher arrests without convictions (like Example 1) had a NO outcome, so this might be low to medium.\n\nWeight: Between 200-224 lbs. The weight in Examples was lower or around that, and outcomes were mostly NO except Example 3 where it wasn't directly mentioned. Maybe no direct impact here.\n\nMarital status: Living alone. All examples had different statuses\u2014Example 1 married, Example 2 single, Example 3 single. Being single might be a bit low risk.\n\nEducation: He's enrolled in school but not a high school diploma or GED. Examples with some education (like Example 2) didn't rearrest, so this is probably medium.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job during the year. In Examples, holding a job was mostly present except in Example 3 where he held 4 jobs. Having a job might actually reduce recidivism, but since it's just one job here, maybe low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and felt down. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, so this should be high. Examples with drug use (Examples 1,2) had NO outcomes except Example 3 which didn't have much info on drugs but had a YES outcome. So this could flip things.\n\nHousehold size: Eight people at young age, in an urban area. Larger households might mean less stress, so maybe low risk factor here.\n\nReligion: Doesn't feel God has something to do with his life. In Examples 1 and 2, he felt connected (\u795e\u6709\u5173\u7cfb), but Example 3 didn't have info on that. Maybe this is a low or medium factor since lack of religious involvement can sometimes correlate with higher risk elsewhere.\n\nPutting it all together: Drug use seems very high as a risk factor because it's a strong indicator of substance abuse issues, which are linked to recidivism. Other factors like arrests (medium), education (medium), etc., balance each other out but the drug use is pushing towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 21 years old, similar to Example 1 where a 21-year-old had a NO outcome.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 8, in an urban area.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
