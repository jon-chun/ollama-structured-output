    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with analyzing this risk assessment case. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is relevant because younger individuals might be more prone to recidivism due to developing skills or higher crime rates. That's a medium weight.\n\nRace is Black; historically, Black individuals have had higher arrest and recidivism rates, so that's high weight.\n\nNumber of prior arrests is one but not convictions\u2014since there are no convictions, it doesn't add much risk beyond the initial arrest, which might be lower than someone with convictions. So low weight.\n\nHeight at 6'8\" isn't directly relevant here; more about physical presence rather than risk factors. Medium weight as it's a unique characteristic.\n\nWeight of 145 lbs is within a normal range but doesn't contribute much to risk assessment. Medium weight.\n\nMarital status\u2014he's living alone, which might indicate stability, so low weight.\n\nEducation level\u2014no diploma or GED and not in college\u2014that's a significant negative factor, high weight.\n\nOccupation\u2014has held two jobs, which is positive as steady work can reduce recidivism; medium weight.\n\nDrug use\u2014he used marijuana but no cocaine. Past four years might include recent use, which could be a risk factor if it affects judgment or substance use impact on behavior. Medium to high weight.\n\nMental health\u2014he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, so that's positive. Low weight.\n\nHousehold size at 4\u2014size doesn't directly correlate with risk unless instability is implied. Medium weight.\n\nGeographic location\u2014living alone without a support network could increase risk, but it's not directly tied to arrest rates; medium weight.\n\nReligious belief\u2014he believes in God affecting his life positively, so that might reduce risk if it provides guidance. High weight.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior non-conviction arrest is low; race is high; education and job stability are mixed with high negatives (education) and positives (jobs). Drug use moderate risk. No mental health issues but no positive signs there either. Height, weight, household size, and religion don't add much.\n\nConsidering all factors, the person has a significant education absence which is a strong risk factor, but other factors like living alone and positive religious belief might temper it. However, since education isn't met, that's a major red flag.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which can be relevant as younger individuals may exhibit more vulnerability to certain factors affecting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"The individual identifies as Black, and historically, Black individuals have had higher rates of arrest and recidivism compared to other racial groups.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"The individual has been arrested once but has not been convicted.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 8 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
