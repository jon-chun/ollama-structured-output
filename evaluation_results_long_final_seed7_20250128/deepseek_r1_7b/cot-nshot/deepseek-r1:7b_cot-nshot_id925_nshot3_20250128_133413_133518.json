    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment case step by step. I'm going to start by carefully analyzing each risk factor provided for the individual in question and then use the examples given to make a prediction.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the risk factors for this person:\n\n- Age: 18 years old\n- Hispanic origin (not applicable)\n- Arrested once but not convicted\n- Height: 6 feet 1 inch\n- Weight: 190 lbs\n- Living alone with no spouse or partner\n- Educational status: Enrolled in school, doesn't have a high school diploma yet\n- Employment: Held one job during the year\n- Drug use: Past four years includes marijuana and cocaine; not depressed in the past month\n- Family history: At young age lived with both parents in a household of 3, in a rural area\n- Personal belief: Doesn't feel God is involved in his life\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided:\n\nExample #1:\n- Hispanic origin but didn't get convicted. Outcome was NO.\nBut this person isn't Hispanic.\n\nExample #2:\n- Black, not convicted, living alone. No drug use or depression. Outcome was NO.\nSimilar to our case except no conviction and no drug use.\n\nExample #3:\n- White, 19 years old, arrested thrice (not convicted), used drugs, felt down, lived with parents in rural area. Outcome was YES.\nOur case is similar but younger by one year.\n\nNow, assigning relative weights based on the examples:\n\n1. **Arrest Record**: High - Since being arrested even once can be a significant risk factor for recidivism. Example #3 had 3 arrests and ended up with YES, while Example #2 had none and ended with NO. So, an arrest record without conviction is high.\n\n2. **Drug Use**: High - Both Examples #3 used drugs and resulted in YES. Our case also uses drugs (marijuana and cocaine), so this aligns with the high weight from the example.\n\n3. **Family History**: Medium - Example #3 had a household of 3, rural area, but outcome was YES due to other factors like drug use. Our case has family history in a similar setting, but since our person didn't have that as a negative factor (as they are not in the examples), it's medium.\n\n4. **Employment**: Medium - Example #2 had none and ended with NO, while Example #3 held 4 jobs but ended YES due to other issues. Our case held one job, which might be better than no job, so maybe medium.\n\n5. **Religion/Belief in God**: Low - The examples didn't mention religion at all except for a factor that was not significant. Our person doesn't believe in God and feels positive about his situation, so this is probably low.\n\n6. **Education**: Medium - Being enrolled vs not having a diploma could be a factor. Example #2 had none but ended with NO, while our case has enrollment but no diploma yet. So medium weight here.\n\n7. **Age**: Low to Medium - Younger than the examples except for the White 19-year-old in example #3. Being 18 might have some protective effect, so maybe low to medium. But considering being arrested once and not convicted, it's a bit of both.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n- Arrest Record: High\n- Drug Use: High\n- Employment: Medium (since held one job)\n- Education: Medium (enrolled but no diploma yet)\n- Family History: Medium (lived with parents in rural area)\n- Age: Low to Medium\n\nConsidering that our case has two high factors (arrest record and drug use) and several mediums, the risk might be higher. However, compared to example #3 which had more factors contributing to a YES outcome, this person's situation is less severe but still concerning.\n\nTherefore, considering the high weight on arrest and drug use, I predict a \"YES\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest Record\", \"high\", \"The individual has an arrest record without conviction which is a significant risk factor for recidivism as seen in Example #3 where multiple arrests led to a YES outcome.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"The use of marijuana and cocaine, similar to Example #3, aligns with the high weight assigned to drug use which contributed to a YES outcome in that case.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Held one job during the year, which is better than having none but may not be as protective compared to being enrolled in school as seen in Example #2 which had NO outcome despite no arrest or conviction. \"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Enrolled in school without a high school diploma yet, similar to Example #2 where no diploma led to a NO outcome but our case has one more positive factor of enrollment.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in a household of 3 in a rural area. While this is not a direct negative factor, it's similar to Example #3 which also had this and resulted in YES due to other factors like drug use and lack of educational attainment.\"),\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"18 years old, which may have protective effects compared to the 19-year-old in Example #3 who did not get a YES outcome despite having similar risk factors like drug use and family history.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 190 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
