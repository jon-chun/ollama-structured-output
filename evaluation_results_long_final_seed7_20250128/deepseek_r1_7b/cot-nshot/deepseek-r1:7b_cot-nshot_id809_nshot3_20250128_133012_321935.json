    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. Let me start by going through each of the given examples to understand how they contribute to recidivism outcomes.\n\nIn Example #1, it's a Hispanic male with several factors like being married living alone, having a high school diploma, job experience, and no drug use in the past four years. His outcome was NO rearrest. So his background seems positive enough to not recidivate.\n\nExample #2 is a Black male who wasn't convicted but had other negative factors. He didn't have a high school diploma, lived alone, used drugs (marijuana), and considered God irrelevant. The outcome was also NO, which might be surprising because of his drug use, but perhaps he's young or has some support.\n\nExample #3 is White, with multiple convictions, drug use (both marijuana and cocaine), living alone in a rural area, negative mood, and low educational status. His outcome was YES, meaning rearrest likely. So the combination of multiple arrests, substance use, living situation, and emotional state contribute to higher recidivism.\n\nNow, looking at the case I need to predict:\n\n- 19-year-old White female\n- 7 prior arrests, all convictions\n- Height: 5'4\", weight 115 lbs (underweight)\n- Living alone\n- High school diploma, not college\n- Held 4 jobs last year\n- Drug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years\n- No depression in the past month\n- At young age lived with biological mother in a household of 4\n- Believes God has something to do\n\nI'll analyze each factor's relative weight.\n\n1. **Number of arrests**: High, since multiple prior convictions significantly increase risk.\n2. **Age and weight**: She is underweight at 5'4\" and 115 lbs. Underweight individuals can be vulnerable health risks which might influence recidivism; so Medium to high weight.\n3. **Living situation**: Living alone increases vulnerability compared to co-habitating, so High risk factor.\n4. **Education level**: High school diploma is positive, but not college might indicate less motivation or higher risk of returning to school.\n5. **Employment history**: Held 4 jobs; stable income can lower recidivism, so Medium.\n6. **Drug use**: Both marijuana and cocaine suggest ongoing substance abuse which is a strong risk factor: High.\n7. **Emotional state**: No depression in the past month might indicate positive mental health, but she considers God has something to do with her, possibly indicating spirituality that could aid in staying sober: Medium (but could be low if the belief impacts positively).\n8. **Household size and living conditions**: Lived with mother in a household of 4; though not extreme, it's an indicator of family support or possible isolation.\n9. **Belief in God**: This might relate to her motivation towards betterment but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism.\n\nPutting this together: The high number of prior arrests (7) is the most significant risk factor. Drug use and living alone are also strong indicators, pushing the prediction towards YES despite some positive factors like education and employment history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"The person has been arrested seven times with all convictions, significantly increasing her recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Age and weight\", \"medium\", \"She is underweight at 5'4\" and 115 lbs, which may indicate vulnerability related to health risks affecting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases vulnerability compared to co-habitating environments, raising her risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college could indicate less motivation or higher risk of returning to education which might aid in avoiding criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs during the year suggests some financial stability, reducing her recidivism risk compared to others with no employment history.\"),\n    (\"Drug use\", \"high\", \"Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years indicates ongoing substance abuse, a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional state\", \"medium\", \"No depression over the past month suggests positive mental health but her belief that God has something to do with her life could provide spiritual support, mitigating some risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Household size and living conditions\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of four does not significantly indicate isolation or family support which might aid in staying sober or avoiding criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
