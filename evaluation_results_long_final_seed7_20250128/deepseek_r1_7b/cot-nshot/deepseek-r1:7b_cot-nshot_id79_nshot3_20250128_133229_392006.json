    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at Example #3 which had a 'YES' outcome: that person was White, arrested thrice but not convicted, used drugs, and felt very depressed. So higher drug use and more prior arrests with negative outcomes seem linked to recidivism.\n\nIn the current case, the person is Black, 19 years old, not been convicted despite one arrest, 5'8\" and 145 lbs. He's living alone without a spouse, has a high school diploma, holds a job, hasn't used drugs in four years but feels very down.\n\nComparing to Example #3: fewer prior arrests (1 vs. 3), no drug use now compared to past, not as depressed. He's also White in Example #3? No, the current case is Black. Wait, Example #2 had a Black person with similar factors leading to 'NO'.\n\nSo maybe being Black isn't a strong risk factor here since he hasn't been convicted yet.\n\nLooking at prior examples: in Example #1 and #2, despite being Hispanic or Black, they both had 'NO' outcomes because other factors like not being in trouble again balanced the risk. The current case has fewer prior issues, no drug use, better mental state, living alone without a family situation as in Example #3.\n\nSo all these factors point towards lower recidivism. Therefore, I'd predict a 'NO' outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"The individual has only one prior arrest and no conviction, which are not strong risk factors for recidivism as they indicate responsibility for past actions.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"low\", \"The individual has never used drugs in the past four years, which significantly reduces the risk of future substance abuse-related crimes. \"),\n    (\"mental_health_status\", \"medium\", \"The individual reported feeling down during the past month, which could indicate underlying mental health issues that may influence decision-making and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"low\", \"Living alone at a young age in an urban area with only one parent indicates less exposure to family dynamics that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and not enrolled in college suggests stable educational background, which is protective against criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"current_living_arrangements\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a spouse reduces the risk of emotional dependency on others, which can influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"occupational stability\", \"medium\", \"Having one job indicates some level of stability, but it could be a risk factor if there are underlying issues that might affect job performance or personal circumstances leading to further trouble.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
