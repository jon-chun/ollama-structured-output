    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the given examples. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 20 years old. In Example #2, a similar age of 19 had an outcome of NO. Since 20 is just one year older, I don't think it's significantly different enough to change the risk assessment here.\n\nRace: Black. Looking at Examples #2 and #3, both Black individuals with similar factors had outcomes of NO and YES respectively. The recidivism rate seems to vary based on other factors like living situation, education, etc., so race alone might not be a strong predictor in this case.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He has been arrested once but not convicted. Comparing to Example #2, who also had one arrest without conviction and outcome NO, this is somewhat similar. However, having more arrests could indicate potential for higher risk if convictions follow.\n\nEducation level: He has a high school diploma. In Examples #1 and #3, individuals with high school diplomas had mixed outcomes (NO, YES). Education seems to be a factor but not the sole determinant.\n\nEmployment history: He hasn't held any jobs in the past year. This is different from Example #2 where he didn't work either, but his lack of employment might suggest lower risk compared to someone with a job history, as seen in Example #3.\n\nDrug use: No drugs in the past four years and no depressed feelings. In Examples #1, #2, and #3, drug use had varying impacts. Not using drugs seems positive for recidivism.\n\nLiving situation: Currently living alone. In Examples #2 and #3, both individuals were living alone or with multiple parents. Living alone might correlate with lower risk if there's no strong support system to help in case of issues.\n\nHousehold size at age: He lived with his biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area. This is similar to Example #2 where the household was of size 5, leading to a NO outcome. Urban areas might offer more resources or community support compared to rural areas, which can sometimes have higher recidivism rates.\n\nGod involvement: He believes God has something to do with his life. In Example #3, someone who considered God had a YES outcome, but in this case, he's Black and doesn't consider God, similar to Example #2 where the outcome was NO.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards low risk except for the household size and race influencing positively or negatively? Wait, actually, in this case, since he is Black and lived with his mother in a larger urban household without considering God, but no prior convictions. The recidivism rate seems to be influenced more by other factors like living alone and stable employment.\n\nSo overall, considering all these points, the risk is low enough that I would predict a NO outcome.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor:\n\n- Age: Low\n- Race: Medium (considering urban environment)\n- Prior Arrests: Low\n- Education: Medium (high school diploma)\n- Employment: Low (no jobs held)\n- Drug Use: Medium (no use, low risk)\n- Living Situation: Low (living alone)\n- Household Size: Medium (household size 5 in urban area)\n- God Involved: Low\n\nGiven these factors, the predicted outcome is NO with high confidence.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 20 years old, which is similar to Example #2 where a 19-year-old had an outcome of NO.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black.
