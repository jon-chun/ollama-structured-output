    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this case based on the examples provided. Let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: she's 21 years old. In the examples, being 19 was common, but in Example #3, a 19-year-old White had a high recidivism rate. The older someone is, the lower their chance of reoffending, so this might be low risk.\n\nEthnicity: she's White. In Example #2, a Black 19-year-old with no convictions had an outcome of NO. But in Example #3, White with multiple arrests and drug use had YES. So being White here isn't necessarily high or low on its own but needs to be considered with other factors.\n\nNumber of arrests: she's been arrested 9 times and convicted. That's a lot\u2014examples have up to 3, so this is definitely high risk.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years. Only Examples #1 and #2 mention past drug use, but Example #1 had no outcome yet Example #3 did. Her current mood isn't positive either. So this adds to her risk\u2014high.\n\n living situation: she's not living alone. In Example #2, someone living alone had a NO outcome. Being in a household with biological mother and in an urban area might be different, but being in a non-single environment could mean higher risk because they have support or more exposure to crime, so medium?\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma. Both Examples #1 & #2 have this, but Example #3 had higher education and still had recidivism. So no direct impact\u2014maybe medium.\n\nEmployment: She's held only one job. In Example #2, someone with none had NO. One job is better than none, so maybe lower risk compared to those who haven't worked or have multiple jobs.\n\nGod involvement: She says nothing about God. In some examples, lack of religious involvement was a factor but not always directly tied to recidivism. So perhaps low impact here\u2014medium.\n\nPutting it all together: high number of arrests (9), past drug use (marijuana), not living alone, and her age might be a mitigating factor. But the main issues are the multiple arrests and drug use.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for this case:\n\n- High number of arrests (9) indicates significant criminal history, which is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\n- Past drug use (marijuana) contributes to substance abuse issues, commonly linked with higher recidivism rates.\n- Living in a household of size 5 in an urban area may present different dynamics compared to smaller households but doesn't inherently lower risk without additional context.\n\nConsidering these factors, the overall prediction leans towards a high risk of rearrest within three years. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may be associated with higher recidivism compared to younger individuals who are typically more adaptable and reformed in their late teens and early twenties.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Her being White does not inherently make her a high risk but needs to be considered alongside other factors such as arrest history and living situation.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested 9 times with no prior convictions, indicating a significant criminal history which is typically associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"She used marijuana in the past four years and currently does not feel depressed, which are factors commonly associated with substance abuse issues linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone but with a household size of 5 in an urban area.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 9 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 105 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
