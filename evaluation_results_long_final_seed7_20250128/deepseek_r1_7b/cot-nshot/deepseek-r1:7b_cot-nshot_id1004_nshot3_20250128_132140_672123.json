    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. I need to analyze the risk factors for a 18-year-old White female based on the examples given. First, I'll look at each factor in her profile.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 126 lbs. In Example #3, a similar age group of White females had no weight-related issues, so maybe this isn't a strong risk factor here.\n\nShe hasn't been convicted but has one arrest. The first example had someone with one conviction leading to NO rearrest, the second with no conviction also NO, and the third with three arrests (unconvicted) resulting in YES. Her single prior arrest might be low or medium weight compared to those examples. \n\nHer living situation is with both parents, similar to Example #3, who was White, 19-year-old female. That gave a NO outcome. So living with supportive family seems protective.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which wasn't a factor in any of the examples, but being in education might indicate better opportunities or less involvement in criminal activities\u2014maybe a mitigating factor.\n\nHeld two jobs last year. The third example had 4 jobs and was White, 19, living alone, resulting in YES. This person has fewer jobs, which could be a low risk factor because job stability often correlates with lower recidivism.\n\nDrug use: she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Examples #2 and #3 didn't mention drug use but resulted in NO outcomes. The third example had some drug use but still NO. This might be a medium risk, as substance use is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nMood: some time feeling down. This could indicate potential stress or depression, which are known contributors to criminal behavior\u2014maybe medium.\n\nShe's 18 and living alone in an urban area with her parents. The family environment seems supportive, like Example #3, so that might lower the risk despite other factors.\n\nConsidering all these points: single prior arrest (low), supportive living situation (high mitigating), education (positive), job history (low), moderate drug use, and mood issues. Combining these, I think her risk of rearrest is low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 18 years old, which is a significant factor in reducing recidivism as younger individuals often have more opportunities to change their lives and may not engage in criminal activities as frequently.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"She is living with both of her biological parents, indicating a supportive family environment which can positively influence behavior and reduce risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She is enrolled in school at the present moment.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 126 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
