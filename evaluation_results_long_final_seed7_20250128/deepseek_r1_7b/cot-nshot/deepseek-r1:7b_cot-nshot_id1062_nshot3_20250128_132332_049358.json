    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this case using the risk factors from the examples provided. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 22 years old. In example #2, a similar age of 19 didn't show any recidivism. Being in his prime years might mean he's more stable or has better life skills, so maybe low risk here.\n\nEthnicity: Black. Looking at the examples, being Black in Example #2 resulted in NO, but another Black person in Example #3 had higher risk factors and also got a YES. So being Black seems to be a moderate factor depending on other elements.\n\nRisk of reoffending: He was arrested once without conviction. The example with similar stats (arrested once) didn't result in a recidivism, so this might not significantly increase the risk but could still play a role.\n\nWeight: 5'7\" and between 125-149 lbs. In Example #3, someone of similar weight had high risk factors leading to YES. Here, his weight is on the lower end, which might be associated with higher risk due to health issues affecting re-arrest rates.\n\nMarital status: Living alone. Example #1 and #2 both live with their spouse or alone but outcomes were NO. However, in Example #3, living alone also didn't lead to YES despite other high factors. So being single is a bit neutral here.\n\nEducation: High school diploma not enrolled in college. The examples show varying education levels but no conviction always has low risk as seen in Example #2 and #1, so this might be low.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job. Having work experience can help with stability, so maybe low to medium risk compared to someone with no employment.\n\nDrug use: Past four years of marijuana and cocaine. This is a high risk factor because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates. Example #3 had high drug use leading to YES, so this should be high.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed in the past month. Positive mental state usually reduces risk, but if he's generally at risk due to other factors, maybe it mitigates slightly, but still positive overall.\n\nHousehold size and living arrangement: Lived with biological mother in a household of 5 urban area. Larger households can sometimes be more supportive or have different dynamics, which might lower risk compared to smaller families. But Example #3 was in a rural household of 3 leading to YES, so maybe urban settings are slightly better.\n\nGod belief: Believes God has something to do with his life. This is positive as religious beliefs often provide support and stability, reducing recidivism risk, so this should be low to medium.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nAge: Low\nEthnicity: Medium (Black but other factors moderate)\nRisk of reoffending: Low\nWeight: High due to being in a lower weight range with drug issues\nMarital status: Low/neutral as living alone doesn't always correlate\nEducation: Low\nEmployment: Medium (1 job is better than none)\nDrug use: High\nMental health: Positive but not directly mitigating the other high factors\nHousehold size: Maybe neutral since in a larger urban area but Example #3 had similar.\nGod belief: Low\n\nSo, despite some positive factors like education and mental health, the high risk from drug use and weight likely make the overall prediction lean towards YES with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 22 years old, which may indicate stability and reduced recidivism risk compared to younger individuals.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Being Black can be associated with higher recidivism rates but in this case does not outweigh other factors\"),\n    (\"Risk of Reoffending\", \"low\", \"Having been arrested once without a conviction is generally less risky than multiple arrests, as seen in similar cases where outcomes were NO\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"high\", \"Living in a lower weight range and using drugs may increase recidivism risk compared to individuals with higher weight or no drug use\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low/neutral\", \"Living alone is not always a strong indicator of high risk, as seen in cases where outcomes were NO despite other factors\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment may indicate lower recidivism risk compared to those not completing education\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding 1 job can provide stability but does not fully offset the impact of other high-risk factors like drug use\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use, along with a history of substance abuse, significantly increases recidivism risk as seen in similar cases where outcomes were YES\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"positive\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month may mitigate some risk factors but does not fully offset others like drug use\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Living Arrangement\", \"neutral\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban household of 5 may provide certain support that is not always present in rural settings as seen in Example #3 which resulted in YES\"),\n    (\"God Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with one's life can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
