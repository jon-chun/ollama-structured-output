    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old female Hispanic case. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has two prior arrests but no convictions. I know that prior convictions significantly impact recidivism; even if someone is not convicted, having a arrest record can increase the chances of reoffending. So that's probably high risk.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs 155 lbs. Weight isn't directly a criminal history indicator unless it affects her ability to work or get housing, but in this case, I don't see an immediate link to recidivism based on her physical attributes.\n\nLiving alone suggests she might have less support network, which can be risky for reoffending. But without knowing her current circumstances beyond living alone, maybe medium risk.\n\nGED certificate and not enrolled in college. A GED can sometimes lead to better job opportunities, but if she's not actively employed or learning new skills, it could be a factor. Since she has one job, perhaps some stability here, which might lower the risk compared to someone with no income.\n\nNo drug use and no depressed feelings in the past month. Positive indicators that she's mentally stable and engaged in healthy activities.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Urban areas can have higher crime rates or social issues, but since she's not convicted yet, maybe living in an urban setting could influence her stability if she feels unsafe.\n\nConsidering God is involved with her life\u2014this might relate to her personal motivations and religious involvement affecting her behavior, possibly positively or negatively depending on the context. But without more info, it's hard to gauge.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrests (high risk), living alone (medium), no convictions yet but a potential for reoffending based on past behavior. The GED might provide some stability if she's employed and using it for better opportunities. Positive factors like no drug use and depression could mitigate some risks, but the prior arrest is still significant.\n\nSo overall, I'm leaning towards a high confidence of YES, as prior arrests are a strong indicator despite other positive factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested twice without convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support networks but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism without additional context on stability or employability.\"),\n    (\"GED_certificate\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and not enrolled in college suggests some educational stability, which might positively influence her ability to reintegrate into society.\"),\n    (\"no_drugs\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs reduces the risk of substance abuse, which is a known factor in recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no_depression\", \"low\", \"Lack of recent depression symptoms indicates mental health stability, which can lower reoffending risk.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of two in an urban area may present challenges but doesn't directly correlate with recidivism without knowing surrounding social factors.\"),\n    (\"god_involved\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement could provide moral support, potentially reducing risk if it contributes to positive behavior patterns.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
