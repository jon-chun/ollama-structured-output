    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old Hispanic male based on his risk factors. Let me start by analyzing each factor from the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which is quite young. In Example #2, a similar age group had a \"NO\" outcome. Younger individuals often have lower recidivism rates because they're less experienced. So this could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. In all three examples with one or more arrests, the outcomes were \"NO.\" Conviction is a strong positive indicator of lower recidivism. This should be high weight.\n\nHis height is 5'7\", which isn't mentioned in the previous examples but generally doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism unless it's extreme. So this might be low or no weight.\n\nHe weighs 180 lbs, again not specified in the examples, so probably medium risk as he's of average weight for his height.\n\nMarital status: he's never been married. In Example #2, someone living alone had a \"NO\" outcome. Being single is typically lower risk compared to those with family support. So maybe low or no weight here.\n\nCurrently living alone: in Example #1 and #2, people living alone had \"NO\" outcomes. Living alone can reduce stress and social support, which are protective factors. So this should be a high negative factor\u2014high weight.\n\nHigh school diploma without college enrollment. In Example #3, someone with a diploma was medium risk. This might indicate lower risk compared to those not educated or in college, so low weight.\n\nHe held 2 jobs during the year. More employment is associated with lower recidivism because of gainful activity reducing time behind bars. So this should be high positive\u2014high weight.\n\nNo drug use and no depression in the past month. Positive indicators pointing towards lower risk. High weight here as well.\n\nLived in a household of size 2 at a young age, in a rural area. In Example #3, a household size of 3 was medium risk but this is smaller. Being with family can provide support, so low to no weight.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014positive factor indicating stability and lower recidivism. High positive weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are conviction (high), number of jobs (high), not using drugs (high), and belief in God (high). Low or medium factors include age, living alone (high negative), education level, household size, and current marital status.\n\nConsidering the high negatives from living alone and other positive factors, I think the risk is on the lower side. The conviction is a strong indicator but combined with living alone and maybe some other factors, perhaps it's a medium to low risk. Given all these, my prediction would lean towards \"NO\" but not entirely sure.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 18 years old, which typically correlates with lower recidivism rates due to youth experience and maturation.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"One prior arrest and conviction are significant protective factors associated with reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"No specific height impact mentioned in previous examples, so likely not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"medium\", \"No mention of weight's correlation with recidivism in the examples, so it may have no significant effect here.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low to medium\", \"Never married individuals typically have lower recidivism risk compared to those who are married or cohabiting.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high negative\", \"Living alone is a strong indicator of lower risk due to reduced stress and social support, which protects against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment may indicate lower risk compared to those with higher education or currently enrolled in college.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"high positive\", \"Held 2 jobs during the year, which is associated with reduced time behind bars and better employability, contributing to lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low negative\", \"No drug use in the past four years indicates good stability, reducing risk factors associated with substance abuse and related issues.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"high positive\", \"No feelings of depression in the past month suggests stable mental health, further reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of Admission\", \"low to medium\", \"Lived in a household of size 2, which may provide adequate support but not as protective as smaller households in some examples.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence on Life\", \"high positive\", \"Strong belief in God's role suggests a stable and supportive environment, reducing risk of negative life events that could lead to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived in a household of size 2. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
