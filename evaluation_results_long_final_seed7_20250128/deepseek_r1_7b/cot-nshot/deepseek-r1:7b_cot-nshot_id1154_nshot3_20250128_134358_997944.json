    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case based on the examples provided. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 20 years old. In the examples, both 19-year-olds had outcomes of NO. So being a teenager might not be a strong indicator here, but it's still a point to note.\n\nRace: Hispanic. Example #2 was also Black with a similar outcome. The recidivism rate for minorities tends to be higher, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He has been arrested once but not convicted. Example #1 had one arrest and outcome NO, while Example #3 had three arrests (not convicted) and outcome YES. So one prior arrest isn't enough to determine it yet.\n\nWeight: 220 lbs. No examples mention weight, so this might be a low or neutral factor.\n\nHeight: 5'8\". Again, no data on height in examples, so probably medium to low impact.\n\nMarital status: Living alone. Example #1 was married and outcome NO, while others were living situations that didn't lead to a YES yet. Living alone could be slightly negative but not definitive.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED. Example #2 had similar with no education and outcome NO. This is a significant factor because lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism.\n\nEmployment history: Held 2 jobs, which in the example was medium, leading to NO. Having some employment might be positive but not enough on its own.\n\nDrug use: Past four years, marijuana only. Example #1 used drugs and outcome NO, while others without drug use or recent use had mixed outcomes. This is a low risk factor since he's not using heavily.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed in past month. The example with depression was YES, so this positive mental state is a high point.\n\nHousehold size at age: 4, which is medium. Example #1 lived with 7 and had NO, while others had varying sizes. Smaller family might indicate more support, but it's not the strongest factor here.\n\nGeography: Urban area. Examples varied geographically; Example #2 was in an urban area but outcome was NO. Urban living can have both pros and cons, so maybe neutral or slightly negative.\n\nBelief in God: He has faith. In Example #3, high religion belief led to YES, while others didn't feel that way. So this is a strong positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nHigh risk factors:\n- Hispanic background (high)\n- Prior arrest (medium but not convicted)\n- Education level (low)\n- Drug use for only marijuana (low)\n- Belief in God (high)\n\nMedium to low: Age, height, living situation, employment history\n\nSo the overall assessment leans towards high risk. Considering the positive mental health and religious belief, maybe a 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The person is 20 years old, similar to other examples of younger individuals who had NO outcomes but does not strongly indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Hispanic background, as seen in Example #2 with a similar outcome of NO, often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without a conviction is not sufficient to predict a YES outcome but might indicate potential risk factors like reoffending potential.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"No data on weight provided in examples; body weight typically does not directly correlate with recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"No data on height provided in examples; height generally does not directly influence recidivism prediction.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone, similar to Example #2 who had a NO outcome but not definitive in itself as a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"No diploma or GED, which is a significant risk factor based on examples with similar outcomes of YES and NO depending on other factors.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held 2 jobs; employment history can influence recidivism but without conviction history, it's not definitive.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Used marijuana in past four years only; moderate drug use is generally a lower risk factor compared to heavy substance abuse.\",\n     \"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"No depressed feelings in past month; positive mental health significantly reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of Arrest\", \"medium\", \"Lived with biological mother in household of size 4; household size can vary influences but is not a strong factor here.\"),\n    (\"Geography\", \"neutral\", \"Lived in urban area; geographic location does not strongly influence recidivism risk without additional data points.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Considers God as something positive affecting his personal experiences; strong positive correlation with lower recidivism rates based on Example #3's outcome of YES.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 220 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
