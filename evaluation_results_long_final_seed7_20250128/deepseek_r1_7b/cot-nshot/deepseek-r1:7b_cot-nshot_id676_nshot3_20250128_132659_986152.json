    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this risk assessment case step by step. The individual in question is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He has a history of 22 arrests with 22 convictions, which immediately raises red flags about criminal history. His weight and height don't seem to contribute much here; he's within a typical range.\n\nHe's living alone, which might suggest some level of independence but could also indicate past instability. Without a high school diploma or GED, he's likely facing educational barriers that could impact his employability and ability to reintegrate into society.\n\nHe's only held one job during the year, so employment history is low. His drug use\u2014marijuana and cocaine in the past four years\u2014is significant because substance abuse can affect job prospects and daily functioning, increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nThe most concerning factor here is his recent emotional state: he feels extremely down most months, which could indicate underlying mental health issues like depression or anxiety. This would make him more vulnerable to stressors in prison, leading to higher recidivism rates.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of two in an urban area might suggest some instability if there have been past family issues. His lack of God involvement is interesting; it might correlate with his emotional state, perhaps indicating self-reliance or coping mechanisms that could be beneficial but also potentially problematic in a correctional environment.\n\nPutting all these factors together: high criminal history, unstable living situation, educational barriers, limited employment, drug use, and severe emotional issues. These factors collectively point towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 22 times with 22 convictions, indicating a significant criminal history that strongly correlates with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is within the typical age range for first-time offenders and may indicate relative stability compared to older individuals who might face more societal challenges.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"The individual weighs 160 lbs, which is a healthy weight for their height of 5 feet 10 inches, suggesting no significant health-related risk factors related to underweight or obesity that could impact recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"The individual is 5 feet 10 inches tall, which is within the normal range and does not indicate any physical health issues that could affect their ability to reintegrate into society or work effectively.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may suggest some level of independence but could also imply past instability, which might have contributed to the current criminal history and could increase risk factors like isolation and stress in prison\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"The individual does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, indicating limited educational opportunities that could impact employability and overall stability.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"The individual has held only 1 job during the year, which may limit their financial independence and skills, increasing the risk of dependency on substance abuse or other resources for survival\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"The individual has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, with recent use indicating ongoing substance abuse that can impair judgment, decision-making, and daily functioning, all of which are critical factors in reoffending.\"),\n    (\"emotional state\", \"high\", \"Most of the time during the past month, the individual has felt extremely down, which could indicate severe mental health issues like depression or anxiety.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 22 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
