    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case. Let's start by looking at the examples given to understand how each factor contributes to recidivism.\n\nIn Example #1, a 21-year-old Hispanic male with several factors like past drug use (marijuana) and living situation influenced his outcome as NO. Similarly, Example #2 shows another Black male with no prior convictions but also an outcome of NO. However, Example #3 is different because he has multiple prior arrests, substance use, and a negative outlook on life, leading to a YES outcome.\n\nNow, looking at the case we need to predict: A 20-year-old White male arrested once without a conviction, weighing between 150-174 lbs. He's living alone with no family, has no education, has held 3 jobs, used marijuana, feels down most of the month, and lived in a household of five in a rural area under God.\n\nBreaking this down:\n\nAge: 20 is considered high risk for reoffending as typically higher risk factors emerge earlier.\nRace: White isn't directly tied to recidivism but can influence trust in systems. Here, he's living alone, which might suggest lower support network, increasing risk.\nEducation: No diploma or GED makes him less likely to secure future opportunities, increasing risk.\nDrug Use: Past marijuana use is present; relapsing could increase rearrest chances.\nLiving Situation: Living alone can isolate him, possibly leading to higher stress and negative mood.\nUnemployment Rate: Being 20 and living alone might mean he's jobless or underemployed, which ties into recidivism.\nMood: He feels down most of the month; chronic emotional distress is a risk factor for reoffending.\nHousehold Size: Household size of five in rural area suggests possible instability, contributing to higher risk.\n\nPutting it all together, each factor here points towards a high risk. The presence of multiple prior issues and current stressors likely mean he's more prone to recidivism within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 20 years old, a relatively young age which may indicate increased risk for reoffending as risk factors typically emerge earlier in life.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"While race can influence trust within the system, there is no direct correlation with higher recidivism rates among White individuals in this case.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"The individual does not have a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which may limit future opportunities and increase risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used marijuana in the past four years.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 4 feet 11 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
