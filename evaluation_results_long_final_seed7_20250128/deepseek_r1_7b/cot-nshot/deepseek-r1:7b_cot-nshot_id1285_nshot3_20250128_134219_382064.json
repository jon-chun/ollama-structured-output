    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the given examples. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as Black. She has one arrest and it's a conviction. That's similar to Example #2 where a Black male with one conviction didn't recidivate. But since she's female, I wonder if gender plays a role here; maybe not a strong factor.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 120 lbs. Weight doesn't seem like a big risk factor on its own, but she's at a lower weight than the previous examples, which might indicate more caution. Not sure how much that affects recidivism though.\n\nCurrently living alone\u2014no one to fall back on in case something goes wrong. That could be a high risk because isolation can lead to self-harm or other risky behaviors seen in Examples #1 and #2 where living with family was protective.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. In the examples, not being enrolled had no outcome\u2014like Example #2 where she didn't graduate either. So maybe education level is neutral here.\n\nShe's held two jobs during the year. Having some employment might be positive, as it can contribute to stability and reduce recidivism. But Examples 1 and 3 show varying job experience with different outcomes.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism, so even if she's not feeling down now, past use can increase future chances.\n\nMood: She feels down sometimes which could indicate underlying issues like depression or stress. This might push her towards criminal behavior in the future.\n\nAt a young age, lived with her biological dad in a household of three. The previous examples had higher household sizes (7 and 5), but this one is smaller. Urban vs rural\u2014this case is rural. Previous Examples #1 was rural (household size 3) and had YES outcome, while Example #2 was urban (household size 5) with NO.\n\nGod belief: She doesn't see God as a factor. Some examples where God wasn't involved still had YES outcomes, but maybe lack of religious support could contribute to higher risk if it's a protective factor in some cases.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a conviction, which is high risk. She's living alone, which also increases risk. Drug use and mood issues are concerning. Her education level isn't great either. While she's young and perhaps more stable, the factors like living situation and prior convictions seem to weigh her towards recidivism.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high confidence that she'll recidminate within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Has one arrest and conviction\", \"high\", \"Conviction history is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"high\", \"Living in isolation can lead to risky behaviors such as self-harm, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use can be an indicator of potential substance abuse, which is linked to recidivism.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Black.
