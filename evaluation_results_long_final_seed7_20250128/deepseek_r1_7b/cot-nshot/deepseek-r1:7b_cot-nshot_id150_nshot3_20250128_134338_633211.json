    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history: 6 arrests and 3 convictions. That's a lot of past Incidents, which is definitely high risk because prior offenses increase the chance of reoffending.\n\nHe's living alone with his mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, so that's another high factor.\n\nHis weight is between 175 and 199 lbs at 5'8\". That might be a bit on the higher side, but if he's athletic or active, maybe it doesn't matter much. Still, body weight alone isn't enough to determine risk.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college\u2014so no formal education, which can limit opportunities and potentially increase recidivism.\n\nHe held only 1 job during the year. Job instability is a known risk factor because losing income can lead to further issues like substance abuse or lack of motivation.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself isn't a direct cause, but it's an indicator of past behavior that could lead to issues again.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of 3 suggests he might have experienced family dysfunction, which can affect mental health or substance use.\n\nHe believes God is involved in his life. This is interesting because religious involvement can sometimes correlate with better outcomes if it promotes accountability, but it's not directly linked to recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a strong criminal history (high), living in an urban area which adds to crime exposure (high), no formal education and unemployment (medium/low each), only one job (low), drug use without recent depression (maybe medium, but not a direct cause). His family background is somewhat negative. Despite his positive belief in God, that's not directly tied to risk.\n\nSo weighting: High for criminal history, high for urban living, medium for unemployment and job holding, low for education and no college. The outcome from the examples had some high factors leading to YES, but here it seems mixed. Maybe leaning towards YES because of prior convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history with 6 arrests and 3 convictions, indicating past Incidents which increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"residential stability\", \"high\", Living in an urban area with instability (living alone) can expose him to higher crime rates and environmental stressors that may contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", Holding a high school diploma without further education or training may limit opportunities and capacity for positive reintegration, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", Employing only 1 job during the year suggests potential economic dependency issues, which can be a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use history\", \"low\", While he has a history of drug use (marijuana), this does not directly correlate with recent positive or negative outcomes, so it is considered low in this context.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", Living with his biological mother in a household of 3 may indicate past family issues that could influence his current behavior and mental health but does not directly link to recitivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious involvement\", \"low\", Believing in God is generally seen as a protective factor, so this is considered low for risk assessment purposes.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
