    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old female who identifies as Asian/Pacific Islander. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is quite young, typically associated with lower recidivism rates since she's still developing socially and legally.\n\nShe has one arrest but no conviction. That might not carry a significant weight on its own unless it's a serious offense, but the example didn't specify that, so I'll consider it low.\n\nHer height is 5'2\" and weight 145 lbs; nothing stands out here as particularly high or low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone. Being single can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism because there might not be support networks, but again, this varies based on other factors.\n\nEnrolled in school: Education is usually a positive factor. She's committed to her studies, which could indicate better life choices.\n\nHeld 4 jobs in the past year; having work experience can be beneficial as it shows stability and practical skills.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine. Drug abuse is strongly linked to higher recidivism because of potential self-destructive behaviors and increased risk of criminal behavior.\n\nFeeling down for much of the month points towards mental health issues, which can contribute to substance abuse and other risky behaviors. This might be a medium to high factor depending on how it's affecting her decision-making.\n\nLiving with both parents in an urban area at age 19 suggests she has some support network, but urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or stressors.\n\nBelieving that God is involved indicates strong moral support, which is generally protective against recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together, the drug use and feelings of low mood seem to be more significant factors. While being single isn't ideal, her education, job history, and moral support are positive indicators. The presence of substance abuse might tip the risk higher than in some cases but not necessarily certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 21, typically associated with lower recidivism rates as she's still developing socially and legally.\"),\n    (\"Arrests without Convictions\", \"low\", \"One arrest may not carry significant weight unless it's a serious offense.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant outliers in height (5'2\") or weight (145 lbs)\"),\n    (\"Marital Status/Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes indicate higher risk due to lack of support networks, though she is single but may have other supports like school and a living situation with parents.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"She is enrolled in school, indicating commitment to learning which could correlate with better life choices and stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Held 4 jobs in the past year; work experience can indicate stability and practical skills which are positive factors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium-high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine, which is strongly linked to higher recidivism due to potential self-destructive behaviors and increased risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Issues\", \"high\", \"Felt down for much of the month; mental health issues can contribute to substance abuse and risky behaviors which are indicators of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Lived with both parents in an urban area, suggesting some support network but urban environments can correlate with higher crime rates or stressors.\"),\n    (\"Moral Support from God\", \"low\", \"Strong moral support which is generally protective against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Asian / Pacific Islander. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
