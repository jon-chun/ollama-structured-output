    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. I need to analyze the risk factors for a 18-year-old White female based on the examples provided and then predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome.\n\nFirst, looking at Example #1: She was 21, Hispanic, arrested once, convicted, living with spouse, high school diploma, held 4 jobs, used marijuana, lived in a household of 7, considered God's involvement. Outcome was NO. So her factors like being married and having a stable environment might have mitigated the risk.\n\nExample #2: 19-year-old Black male, arrested once but not convicted, living alone, no education or job, lived with mother in urban area, didn't feel depressed. Also outcome was NO. Here, being single, no job, and living alone increased his risk, but maybe the lack of conviction played a role.\n\nExample #3: 19-year-old White, arrested thrice, not convicted, heavy drug use (marijuana and cocaine), felt very down, small household in rural area, considered God's involvement. Outcome was YES, meaning higher risk factors led to re-arrest.\n\nNow, for the case at hand: 18-year-old White female, arrested twice but not convicted, married living with spouse, no education or job, held 3 jobs (so medium), used marijuana and felt down, lived in a household of 6 in rural area, believes God is involved.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Age: Younger than the examples. Generally, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates but since she's married and living with spouse, that's mitigating.\n- Arrests: Two, not convicted. More arrests can be a risk factor, especially if they are recent or multiple.\n- Employment: Held 3 jobs in past year\u2014medium. Previous examples had varying job histories; this is moderate.\n- Drug Use: Marijuana use and feeling down for some time. This could be a significant risk factor as substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism.\n- Living Arrangements: Lives with spouse, married, so more stable living situation which might reduce risk.\n- Household Size: 6 in rural area\u2014larger household can sometimes correlate with lower risk due to shared resources and support, but size alone isn't enough without context. Being in a rural area might influence other factors like access to help or environment.\n- Belief in God: If it's considered positive correlation (as in Example #3), her belief could mitigate negative feelings, but being White might have different outcomes.\n\nPutting this together:\n\nHigh risk factors include the two prior arrests, drug use, feeling down. Medium factors are living with spouse and married age. The small household size in rural area is a bit mitigating but not sure how much impact that has on recidivism compared to other factors.\n\nComparing to examples, Example #3 had multiple high-risk factors (arrests, drugs, feelings of low mood) leading to YES. This case shares some of those: two arrests, drug use, feeling down. But she's married and in a larger household, which might lower the risk compared to someone without that.\n\nI think her overall risk is medium because while there are mitigating factors like living with spouse and being married at 18, the two prior arrests and other negative factors still point towards moderate re-arrest risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her being 18 years old is a mitigating factor as younger individuals sometimes have higher recidivism rates but she is married and living with her spouse, which suggests a stable environment.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested twice without a conviction, which can be considered high risk as multiple arrests are often indicators of problematic behavior.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held 3 jobs during the past year\u2014moderate work history which could indicate some inconsistency in stability but not necessarily a strong indicator of future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and felt down for part of the month.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse.

She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
