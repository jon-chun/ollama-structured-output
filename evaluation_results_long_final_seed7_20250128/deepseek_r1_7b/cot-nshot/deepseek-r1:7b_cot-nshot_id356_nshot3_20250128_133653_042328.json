    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given case using the example data provided. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 18 years old. In the examples, most people were either 19 or 21. Younger might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing socially and emotionally. So that's a high risk.\n\nRace: White is mentioned in all examples as having different outcomes based on other factors, but not alone. She has no prior convictions, which is good, but her arrest count is 17 times\u2014way more than the examples. So race might play a role with other factors.\n\nNumber of previous arrests and convictions: 17 arrests and 17 convictions. The examples had much fewer. This is definitely high risk because more past convictions increase the chance of future crimes.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED, same as Example 2, which had a NO outcome despite being Black with no arrest. So her lack of education is a factor but not as strong on its own as other factors like living situation.\n\nEmployment: She held only one job in the past year. The examples mostly had people who didn't work or held multiple jobs. Having a stable job might reduce recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nLiving situation: She's not living alone, which is different from Example 2 where she was living alone. Not living alone could offer more support and stability, reducing risk\u2014so medium to low weight.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. The examples had varying drug use; some didn't use at all. This is a high risk factor because drug use can lead to other criminal behaviors or increased stress.\n\nMental health: Some of the time, she felt very down. Mental health issues might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior\u2014high risk here.\n\nHousehold size and living conditions: She lived with her parents in a household of 4. Example 3 had a household of 3 but was White and considered God's role as nothing. Larger households sometimes provide more support, so this is medium risk.\n\nReligious belief: Her statement about God might suggest she has some level of mental stability or guidance, which could be protective. So maybe lower risk here, balancing out the other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: High age risk due to youth, high arrest conviction count, no education, part-time job, drug use, and mental health issues. Living with parents in a larger household somewhat mitigates but doesn't fully offset. The combination points towards a high recidivism probability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"She is 18 years old, which is relatively young, increasing the risk of future criminal behavior and instability in personal relationships.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Being White does not inherently increase recidivism risk, but it may be influenced by other factors like living conditions and household size.\"),\n    (\"Number of Previous Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested 17 times without a conviction, indicating a history of criminal behavior that can lead to further involvement in the future.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She does not have a high school diploma or GED, which may limit her ability to secure stable employment and avoid opportunities for recidivism\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"She has held only 1 job during the year, which may provide limited stability and reduce opportunities for engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone offers more support and stability compared to those who live alone, potentially reducing risk factors associated with isolation.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which can lead to increased stress, substance abuse, and potential criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Some of the time during the past month she felt very down, which may contribute to risky decision-making or increased engagement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Household Size and Living Conditions\", \"medium\", \"Living with her parents in a household of 4 provides some support but does not fully mitigate the risk associated with living in larger households compared to smaller ones like Example 3's household of size 3.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Her belief that God has something to do with her personal events may provide a sense of direction and stability, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 17 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.

At a young age, she lived in a household of size 4. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
