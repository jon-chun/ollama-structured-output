    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old White male. Let's break down his risk factors step by step.\n\nFirst, he has only been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That might not be too bad since conviction is a more serious factor. He weighs between 200 and 224 lbs, which is on the higher end for his height of 6 feet 11 inches\u2014so that's a high risk weight.\n\nHe's living alone with no family support, which is concerning because having a supportive household usually reduces recidivism. His educational status shows he's enrolled in school, which might indicate he's motivated to change his situation\u2014maybe a medium risk here since education can be a positive factor if applied correctly.\n\nHe has one job during the year, but that's not enough to provide stability. Using drugs (marijuana and cocaine) every time is definitely a red flag because substance abuse often leads to other issues or bigger problems. His mood is really bad\u2014he feels so down all the time\u2014which could be a sign of deeper mental health issues.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area might not directly correlate to higher risk, but being in an urban environment can sometimes have its own set of challenges that could contribute indirectly. Lastly, he doesn't believe in God, which some studies suggest might affect his personal motivation and decision-making.\n\nPutting this all together: high for weight, high for family issues, medium for education, low for job stability, high for drug use, high for mood, maybe a bit low on urban living but not sure. So the overall risk seems pretty high because multiple factors are pointing towards higher likelihood of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which could indicate a period of vulnerability and impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"high\", \"He weighs between 200 and 224 lbs at 6 feet 11 inches, indicating potential health risks and substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"high\", \"Living alone with no family support increases the likelihood of unstable living conditions and potential substance abuse triggers.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Enrolled in school but has not held a job for over a year, which could indicate lack of motivation or skills for reintegration.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Heavy use of marijuana and cocaine every time suggests ongoing substance abuse issues, which are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Mood\", \"high\", \"Feeling down all the time indicates possible mental health issues that could lead to increased risk of engaging in harmful behaviors or seeking criminal opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Residence\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in an urban area does not directly correlate to higher risk, but urban environments can have unique challenges.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 11 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
