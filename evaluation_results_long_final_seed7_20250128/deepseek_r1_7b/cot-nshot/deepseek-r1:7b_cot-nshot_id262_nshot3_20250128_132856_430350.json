    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case. Let me start by breaking down the risk factors provided.\n\nFirst, age: She's 20 years old. The examples given were mostly around 19-21, but being younger might not directly affect her chances unless there's a specific reason why her age would make her more or less likely to reoffend. I don't have data on how age impacts recidivism beyond that, so maybe this factor is low.\n\nEthnicity: She identifies as White. Looking at the examples, Example 3 has a White male with similar factors and his outcome was YES. However, her age being 20 versus 19 or 21 might not show a clear trend based on the given data. So maybe this factor is medium.\n\nNumber of arrests: She's been arrested twice but not convicted. The examples had arrest counts from 0 to 3, with outcomes varying. Having two arrests could be a warning sign because more arrests often mean more history of potential issues. That might push her towards a higher risk.\n\nDrug use: She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of higher recidivism because drug use can impair judgment, increase impulsive behavior, and lead to saferetting or self-harm, all of which are risks for reoffending. So this factor should be high.\n\nLiving situation: She's living with her biological mother in a household of size 2 in an urban area. The examples included households of various sizes, but being in a smaller household might not directly correlate with recidivism unless there were issues within the family that contributed to past behavior. Since she's never been married and is single now, maybe this factor isn't as impactful. I'll rate it low.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can be linked to lower recidivism because having an education might provide better opportunities and stability. However, if she's not completing her education, that could be a risk. Since she's already got the diploma but isn't in college, maybe this is medium.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of mental health issues is positive for recidivism because it suggests she might have better coping mechanisms or support systems. So, low here.\n\nPrevious convictions: None mentioned, so that's not a factor since her arrests are non-convicted.\n\nEmployment: She hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to stress and increased risk of engaging in risky behaviors or substance abuse. This should be high as it contributes to instability.\n\nReligious belief: She believes God has something to do with her life, which is present in Examples 1 and 3 but not Example 2. Religious beliefs might provide moral guidance, so this could be a protective factor, maybe low impact.\n\nPutting it all together: High on drug use, high on unemployment, medium on age and education, medium on living situation, low on others. So overall, the risk is likely to be YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Age being 20 years old does not directly indicate a higher risk of recidivism compared to the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Identifying as White may suggest potential similarities with past cases, but age and other factors should be considered for a more accurate assessment.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"Two arrests without convictions indicate a history of potential issues that could correlate with higher risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a significant indicator of substance abuse, which can impair judgment and lead to saferetting or self-harm, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in an urban area does not inherently suggest higher risk based on family dynamics provided in other examples.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma but not enrolled in college may provide some stability but could also indicate potential barriers to further education or opportunities, which might be linked to recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests she has good mental health, which is associated with better coping mechanisms and support systems, reducing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Previous Convictions\", \"not applicable\", \"No information on previous convictions, but the focus here is on non-convicted arrests\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Not holding any jobs during the year indicates a state of unemployment, which can contribute to stress and increased engagement in risky behaviors or substance abuse, significantly increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing that God has something to do with her life may provide moral guidance but does not directly indicate higher or lower recidivism risk based on the information provided.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone.

At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
