    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. First, let me go through the examples provided to understand how each factor contributes to recidivism.\n\nLooking at Example #1: A 21-year-old Hispanic male with one prior arrest, not convicted. He's married and living with his spouse. High school diploma, not college. Worked four jobs in a year. Drug use in past four years (marijuana) but no depression recently. Young household size seven. Believes God has something to do with his life.\n\nOutcome: NO rearrest.\n\nIn Example #2: 19-year-old Black male, first arrest, not convicted. Living alone, no high school diploma or GED. No jobs, recent positive drug test, no depression. Small urban household from birth. God doesn't seem to play a role.\n\nOutcome: NO.\n\nExample #3: 19-year-old White man with three prior arrests (unconvicted). He's tall at 6ft, living alone, high school diploma. Worked four jobs. Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Recent depression. Small rural household from parents. Doesn't believe God is involved.\n\nOutcome: YES rearrest within three years.\n\nSo, from these examples, higher number of prior arrests without conviction seems to increase the risk. Not being convicted despite arrests does matter because Example #3 had more prior arrests but was White and rural, leading to a YES outcome.\n\nNow, looking at the case I need to assess:\n\n- 18-year-old White male.\n- 1 arrest, not convicted.\n- Height: 6ft, weight between 175-199 lbs. (Overweight or maybe obese? Maybe affects self-perception.)\n- Living alone.\n- High school diploma, not in college.\n- Held one job during the year.\n- Drug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years.\n- No recent depression.\n- Lived with both parents at household size 6 in rural area.\n- Believes God has nothing to do with his life.\n\nFirst, prior arrests without conviction are a risk factor. He's had one arrest but not a conviction, so that might be considered low impact since Example #1 also had similar factors and outcome was NO.\n\nHis weight is in the higher range; maybe affects self-esteem or social dynamics, but I'm not sure how that translates to recidivism.\n\nLiving alone: Some studies suggest living with others can reduce stressors, but it's just one factor. He's a White male in Example #3 who had more prior arrests and was rural, which led to YES. His background seems similar except for the number of prior arrests.\n\nDrug use is significant. Past four years of marijuana and cocaine could be a strong indicator; substance abuse can lead to other issues that might increase recidivism.\n\nHousehold size 6 in rural area: Larger families might have different dynamics, but since he's living alone, maybe it's not as impactful. However, being from such a household at a young age could influence his experiences and risk factors.\n\nBelief that God has no role: This is more of a personal factor related to mental health rather than substance use or criminal history. It might suggest he doesn't have strong moral compass but could also indicate other issues.\n\nSo, considering all these, the high risk factors are:\n\n1. Prior Arrests (low impact since Example #1 had similar but NO outcome)\n2. Drug Use (high)\n3. Small household size and rural living (maybe medium)\n\nSince drug use is a major factor in recidivism, along with any prior criminal history even if not convicted, the risk might be higher.\n\nBut wait, in Example #3, more prior arrests led to YES, but this case has fewer prior arrests but still had some drug use. So maybe the combination of factors here would lean towards NO or maybe slightly YES.\n\nGiven that he has a history of drug use and his background isn't as negatively impacted by other factors like being married (unlike Example #3), I might lean towards a higher risk, perhaps pushing towards YES but not entirely sure because fewer prior arrests.\n\nBut considering Example #1 had no prior convictions except one, high school diploma, married living with spouse, which are protective factors. Here, he's White, has similar background except for more recent drug use and fewer previous convictions.\n\nSo, maybe the risk is medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"The individual has one prior arrest but no conviction.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White.
