    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. Let's start by looking at the provided examples to understand how each factor contributes to recidivism.\n\nIn Example #1, the person is a Hispanic male with several factors: he's been arrested once, married, has a high school diploma, and has job experience. Despite these positive traits, his outcome was NO rearrest. It seems that even though he had some mitigating factors, his past arrest might have influenced the outcome.\n\nExample #2 shows a Black male who hasn't been convicted yet but lives alone without any previous convictions or significant support network. His outcome was also NO, indicating that lack of conviction and living alone are important factors in lower recidivism.\n\nIn Example #3, despite having multiple negative factors like being arrested three times and drug use, the outcome was YES. This suggests that certain risk factors can significantly increase recidivism if not mitigated properly.\n\nNow, looking at the case to predict: a 20-year-old Black male who hasn't been convicted but has one arrest. He lives alone in an urban area with a large household and has recent drug use (cocaine). Let's weigh each factor:\n\n- Age: 20 is quite young; may not have had much life experience, possibly leading to less stable habits.\n- Race: Black can be a mitigating factor if there are systemic issues addressed, but it's also associated with higher recidivism in some contexts.\n- Arrests: Only one non-convicted arrest could indicate potential for future behavior, despite no prior convictions.\n- Drug use: Cocaine use is a significant risk factor as it impairs judgment and can lead to criminal behavior.\n- Living alone: This can be both a protective and risk factor. Living in an urban area with a large household might offer more exposure but also possibly more resources or stressors.\n- Recent depression: No indication, which is positive.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most concerning aspects are recent drug use and lack of significant support (living alone). These could increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior, despite mitigating factors like age. Therefore, the prediction would lean towards a higher risk, but not certain due to the young age.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 20 years old, which may indicate less life experience and potentially less stable habits that could contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Being Black can be a mitigating factor if there are systemic issues addressed but also associated with higher recidivism in some contexts.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"low\", \"He has one non-convicted arrest, which indicates potential for future behavior despite no prior conviction.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"He has used cocaine in the past four years, which is a significant risk factor as it impairs judgment and can lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with a large household in an urban area might offer more exposure but also possibly more resources or stressors.\"),\n    (\"Recent Depression\", \"low\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, which is positive and indicates good mental health.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 8, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
