    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case based on the provided examples. Let me start by understanding each factor in the current case and comparing them with the previous examples.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female Black. She's been arrested twice but not convicted. Her height is 5'7\", single living, no diploma or GED, not enrolled in college, no jobs held in the past year. Drug use: marijuana in the past four years, no depression feelings in the last month. Youngest age ever lived with her mom in a household of two, believes God affects her life.\n\nLooking at Example 1 and 2, both had Black males, but different outcomes. Example 3 was White with more arrests, leading to a YES outcome. In this case, our subject is Black female, so similar to the Black males but different enough due to gender and other factors.\n\nHer age might be a factor; she's 22 vs. the older subjects in examples (19 or 21). Younger might imply less established habits. Being single could mean fewer social networks which might influence risk differently than living with family, as seen in Example 3 where White female lived with parents and had a YES outcome.\n\nHer drug use is only marijuana, similar to the Black male but different from the White example who used both marijuana and cocaine. No depression in last month suggests she's managing her mental health, which might lower recidivism risk compared to someone who felt depressed (like Example 3).\n\nShe has no prior jobs, so employment history isn't a factor here, unlike the White female in Example 3 who held four jobs. Not having a diploma or GED is common with Black females as well; many face educational barriers.\n\nLiving alone versus living with parents could influence support networks. In Example 3, she lived with her biological mother and had a YES outcome, possibly due to family support or different factors like household size (3) vs her case at household of 2. \n\nConsidering the belief in God affecting her life is a positive aspect, suggesting personal motivation which might reduce recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: She's Black female, age 22, single, no diploma, no prior jobs, no college, no convictions but two arrests. Drug use is only marijuana, no recent depression. Family history of living with mother in a small household may influence differently than her personal belief in God.\n\nI think her risk factors point towards moderate risk because she's Black female without a conviction but two arrests, which could be significant compared to previous examples where only one arrest was present. Her lower education and employment status might increase risk compared to the White female who held jobs but had more prior issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her being 22 years old may indicate less established life experiences compared to older individuals, potentially affecting recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Black females often face systemic barriers that could moderately influence risk factors but are not the primary determinant here.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests without conviction might significantly increase risk compared to previous examples with fewer arrests or no convictions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"low\", \"Her use only of marijuana in the past four years, unlike previous cases where other drugs were involved, may slightly reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone versus with parents could vary support networks, potentially increasing risk due to limited familial backing.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Without a high school diploma or GED, similar to previous cases, this factor might moderate risk but not significantly compared to employment status.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"No prior jobs aligns with some previous examples where employment was absent, potentially indicating higher risk from lack of stability.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"high\", \"Her strong belief may offer personal motivation reducing recidivism risk compared to the White female's possible lack thereof in Example 3.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 7 inches. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 2. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
