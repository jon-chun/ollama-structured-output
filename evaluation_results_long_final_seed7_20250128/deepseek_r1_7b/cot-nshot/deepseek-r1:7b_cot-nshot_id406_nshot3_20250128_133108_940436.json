    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk assessment case step by step. First, let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nThe person is a 21-year-old White male with 4 arrests and 3 convictions. That's a high number of prior convictions, which typically increases the risk of recidivism. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 170 lbs. Weight doesn't usually play a significant role in recidivism unless there's health issues involved, but nothing here suggests that, so maybe this is low or medium.\n\nCurrently living alone with no children, which might indicate he's an adult and perhaps more responsible, so probably a lower risk factor.\n\nGED certificate means he has some educational background, which could mean better job opportunities, possibly lowering the risk. But since he's not enrolled in college, that's a negative. So maybe this is low or medium depending on other factors.\n\nHe held 1 job during the year; having a job can help with financial stability and reduce recidivism, so probably a low to medium factor.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana four years ago but hasn't in the past month, except feeling very down. Drug use history is a red flag because even recent use can be significant if it affects his mental health or ability to function. Plus, feeling \"down\" might suggest underlying issues that could lead to more problems.\n\nReligious belief: He says God has something to do with his life. Some have found that religious support can aid in substance abuse recovery and overall stability, so maybe this is a mitigating factor.\n\nPast living situation: At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area. Urban environments might have different social or environmental factors compared to rural areas, but without specific info on how that affects him now, it's hard to say\u2014maybe medium.\n\nNow, compiling these together:\n\nHigh risk from prior convictions and drug use.\nMedium from being White (but race isn't a direct factor here unless there are systemic issues).\nGED is positive but not in college.\nLiving alone with no kids: maybe low.\n1 job: moderate help.\nReligious involvement could be good or bad depending on context.\n\nPutting it all together, the main factors pushing him towards recidivism are prior convictions and drug use. The positive factors like GED and living alone may somewhat mitigate but aren't strong enough to offset the high risk from the other areas. So I'd lean towards a YES outcome with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has 4 prior arrests and 3 convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Used marijuana in the past four years but feels very down during the past month, indicating possible substance abuse issues that could lead to further problems.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone without children or spouse, which may indicate personal stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"GED Certificate\", \"low\", \"Has a GED certificate, which typically indicates educational attainment that can positively influence job opportunities and financial stability.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"Held only 1 job during the past year; job experience generally supports financial stability and reduced recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"Believes God has something to do with his personal life, which may provide support and reduce stress, acting as a mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Lived in an urban area with a household of 3 at a young age; urban environments can have different social dynamics compared to rural areas but no specific impact is noted here.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
