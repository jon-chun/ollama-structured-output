    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case based on the examples provided. Let me start by going through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 19 years old. In the examples, younger individuals didn't recidivate as much, but it varies. Since there are no examples with a similar age group yet, I'll assign medium risk here.\n\nNext, race: he's White. The third example had a White person who did recidivate (YES), so maybe this factor is high because being charged with multiple offenses can increase the chance of rearrest.\n\nConvictions: He has been arrested once but not convicted. In Example 1 and 2, those who were convicted or had more convictions had higher risk. Since he's only arrested once without a conviction, maybe this isn't as high.\n\nHeight: 6 feet with weight between 175-199 lbs. The examples didn't specify height, but weight might be related to other factors. I'll say medium because it's within the range but not extreme.\n\nMarital status: He's living alone and never married. Living alone can increase risk of substance abuse or stress, so maybe high risk here.\n\nEducation level: High school diploma but not enrolled in college. This could mean he's seeking more education, which sometimes correlates with lower recidivism, but since he's 19, maybe medium.\n\nNumber of jobs held last year: He held 2 jobs. More stable income might reduce recidivism risk, so low here.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and not depressed in the past month. Drug use can be a sign of underlying issues, so maybe high risk.\n\nHousehold size at young age: Lived with both parents in a household of 5 rural area. Larger families sometimes have different dynamics, but living with multiple family members might mean better support or more strained relationships if things go wrong, so medium.\n\nGod involvement: He believes God has something to do with his life. Strong moral beliefs can sometimes be protective, but it's not always the case. Maybe low risk here since he didn't experience any negative outcomes from that belief in the past month.\n\nPutting this all together: Medium risk for being White and living alone, high for other factors like drug use and lack of convictions. So overall, maybe a 60% confidence level leaning towards YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which falls in the young adult category where rearrest rates are typically lower but can vary based on other factors like race and living situation.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
