    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out this risk assessment for a 21-year-old White male who's been arrested four times with prior convictions. He lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma, no jobs, uses marijuana, and has some severe mood issues like feeling down a lot.\n\nLooking at the examples provided:\n\nIn Example #3, someone with similar factors (3 arrests, not convicted) had a recidivism of YES because he used drugs and felt down. But in our case, he's already been convicted, which is different.\n\nThe high school diploma is missing here; maybe that's a mitigating factor since Example #2 didn't have one but still got NO. Wait, no\u2014Example #1 had a diploma and got NO too. Hmm, perhaps not as much of an issue now.\n\nHe lives alone in an urban area with his mom, which might affect his support system but not sure if it's high risk.\n\nHis mood issues are significant\u2014he felt so down that he couldn't cheer himself up. That seems like a strong indicator for recidivism.\n\nHe has four jobs held during the year\u2014actually none now since he's been convicted already. Wait, no, in our case he's never held any jobs, which might be a positive factor because Example #2 also had no jobs and got NO, but that was only one arrest.\n\nSo factors to consider: prior convictions (high), lack of education (medium), unemployment status (low? He wasn't employed?), living alone with a problematic household (maybe medium), drug use (low or medium depending on frequency), mood issues (high). \n\nPutting it all together: His prior four arrests are high risk. Drug use and severe mood issues also point to high risk, even though he's been convicted already. Since Example #3 was NO despite having some similar factors, maybe his situation is more dire here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of four arrests with prior convictions, indicating a significant criminal history that increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, which may limit his ability to secure employment and make positive choices in the future.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"The individual has not held any jobs during the year, which can contribute to financial instability and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"home_living_conditions\", \"medium\", \"He lives alone with a biological mother in a household of size 3, which may provide limited support but does not inherently guarantee stability.\"),\n    (\"mood_issues\", \"high\", \"The individual reported feeling down in the dumps for much of the past month, which can impair judgment and decision-making abilities.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years, which may indicate occasional substance abuse but not consistent use that directly correlates with recidivism.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
