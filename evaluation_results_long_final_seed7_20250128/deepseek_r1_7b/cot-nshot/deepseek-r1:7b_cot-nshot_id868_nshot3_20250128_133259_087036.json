I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the case in question is of a 22-year-old White male with several risk factors. His background includes multiple arrests and convictions, which immediately raise concerns about past behavior that could impact his ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\n\nLooking at his current living situation, he's living alone without a family, which might contribute to feelings of isolation or depression, as indicated by his mood during the month. His education level is concerning\u2014he has no high school diploma and hasn't enrolled in college, which are factors often associated with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis past drug use (marijuana) and recent feelings of low mood could indicate underlying mental health issues that might affect his judgment or decision-making skills in the future. Additionally, his past living arrangements at a young age add stressors that could influence his current behavior and future outcomes.\n\nConsidering all these factors\u2014multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable living situation, drug use, and emotional distress\u2014it's clear he has significant risk indicators. While each factor can be evaluated on a low, medium, or high scale based on their impact, the combination points towards a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which may indicate a period in life where risk-taking behaviors are more common.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested 5 times and convicted once, indicating past problematic behavior.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"medium\", \"His weight fluctuates between 150 and 174 lbs, which may contribute to health issues that could affect his well-being and ability to reintegrate.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Housing Stability\", \"low\", \"He is living alone without a spouse or partner, indicating possible social isolation and instability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college, highlighting potential lack of skills that could aid in reintegrating successfully.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"very low\", \"He has held no jobs during the year, indicating possible economic instability which may contribute to substance use and other risk behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana in the past four years and felt depressed recently, which could indicate ongoing health issues or mental health challenges that may affect his behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"He lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3 in an urban area, though this should not be interpreted as ideal living conditions that have positively influenced his current behavior.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's Influence on His Life\", \"medium\", \"His belief in God may provide some level of support or guidance but does not necessarily mitigate risk factors related to substance use and depression.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
