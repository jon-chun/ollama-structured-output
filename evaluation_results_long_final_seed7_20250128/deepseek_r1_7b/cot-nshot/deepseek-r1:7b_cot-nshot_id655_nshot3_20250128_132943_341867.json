    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I need to assess the risk factors for an 18-year-old Hispanic female based on the examples given. First, I'll look at each factor in the case and compare them to the examples.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at Example #2, a similar situation where someone was arrested once without conviction had a NO outcome. So that's a low risk factor for her.\n\nHer height is 5'3\", which isn't mentioned in any example, so I'll consider it as no bearing on the examples given.\n\nShe weighs 130 lbs. Again, not an issue in the examples.\n\nLiving alone: In Example #2 and #3, both had issues with living alone but still got a NO outcome. So that's low risk here too.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED: Similar to Example #2 where she didn't have a diploma. That was a NO, so this is low.\n\nNot enrolled in college: Again, similar to her situation in the examples, which was also a NO.\n\nShe held 1 job during the year: This isn't directly mentioned in any example, but perhaps one job might be lower risk compared to higher employment status.\n\nNo drug use and no depression: Positive factors that contribute to low risk. In Example #2, she didn't use drugs or feel depressed, which was a NO outcome.\n\nLiving with both parents in a household of 9 in an urban area: This is similar to the Hispanic female's situation but without conviction. In Example #2, this demographic factor (household size) might not have been a significant risk factor yet still resulted in a NO outcome.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life: This positive belief could be seen as a mitigating factor. In Example #3, the White male had a high risk despite other factors, so perhaps this is a protective trait that lowers risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors point towards low risk except for not being convicted and living alone compared to not having any issues with those in previous examples. Since she's similar to Example #2 but without conviction, the outcome would probably be NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests (1 time, not convicted)\", \"low\", \"In this case, the individual has been arrested once but not convicted.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year.

At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 9, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
