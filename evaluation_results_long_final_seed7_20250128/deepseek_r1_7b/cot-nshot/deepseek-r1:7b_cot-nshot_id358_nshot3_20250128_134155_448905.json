    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to analyze the provided examples and then apply a similar approach to predict the recidivism outcome for the given case.\n\nLooking at Example #1: The person is Hispanic, 21 years old, not convicted, married, no college, held 4 jobs, used marijuana in past four years but not depressed recently. He lived with 7 people as a child and believes in God. Outcome was NO rearrest.\n\nExample #2: Black, 19, not convicted, living alone, low education, no job, no drugs, no recent depression. Lived with mother in urban area. Outcome also NO.\n\nExample #3: White, 19, arrested thrice but not convicted, higher weight and height than others, some drug use (marijuana/cocaine), felt down for most of the month. Lived with parents in rural area, no marriage, living alone, high school diploma. Outcome was YES.\n\nNow, looking at the case to predict:\n\n19-year-old White male, arrested once not convicted, 5'6\" and 173 lbs, never married, living alone, has a HS diploma, held 2 jobs, drug use (marijuana) past four years, felt extremely down for most of last month. Lived with biological mother in household size 4.\n\nI need to assign weights to each risk factor from the examples and then apply them here.\n\nCommon factors across all examples include age, race, living situation, education level, job history, drug use, and emotional state.\n\nFrom Examples:\n- Higher number of prior arrests (Examples #1: 1, #3: 3) seem linked with higher recidivism.\n- Age isn't a clear factor here since all are 19 or 21. But in the given case, it's on the lower end but not necessarily a strong indicator.\n- Weight and height aren't directly mentioned except that Example #3 was heavier (165 lbs) which might be associated with higher risk if weight is an indicator, but here he's 173 lbs.\n- Marital status: living alone in Examples #2 and the given case. In Example #2, outcome was NO; in #3, living with parents led to YES.\n- Education level: high school diploma vs GED or no diploma. Example #3 had a diploma but still a YES. So maybe education isn't as critical here.\n- Job history: more jobs might correlate with lower risk if they can support themselves, but Example #1 held 4 jobs and outcome was NO. In the given case, 2 jobs, which could be medium.\n- Drug use: past four years of marijuana in Examples #1 and #3; Example #3 had somecocaine as well. High drug use (given case only marijuana) seems to correlate with higher risk, especially if it's recent or ongoing.\n- Emotional state: feeling down for most of the month. Example #3 felt very down and outcome was YES. Here, he feels extremely down, which is a strong indicator.\n\nAssigning weights:\n- Prior Arrests: Medium (1 arrest in example 2 vs 3 in example3; so medium weight)\n- Age: Low relevance\n- Weight/Height: No direct impact mentioned\n- Marital status: Living alone has no direct impact but Example #3 living with parents had a positive outcome, which is conflicting. Maybe low weight.\n- Education: Medium (has diploma but it's not as high in the examples)\n- Job History: Medium (2 jobs in given case vs 4 in example1)\n- Drug Use: High (past four years of use and recent feelings of down)\n- Emotional State: High\n\nPutting this together, higher risk factors are drug use and emotional state. Prior arrest is medium but not as high.\n\nSo the risk assessment would likely lean towards a high probability of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The person has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted, which could indicate past behavior that might influence future actions.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 173 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
