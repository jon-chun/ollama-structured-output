    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this new case based on the examples provided. Let me start by looking at each factor in detail.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 21 years old. In Example #1, a similar age group had an outcome of NO. So being young might not be a strong indicator here.\n\nRace: He's White, like Examples #3 and #2 where White individuals also had outcomes that varied but overall maybe higher risk? I'm not sure yet, need to check other factors.\n\nNumber of arrests and convictions: He has 5 arrests with no convictions. In Example #1, someone with 1 arrest (convicted) had a NO outcome, so more arrests might increase the risk. High number here is definitely a high factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 2 inches, 165 lbs. No info on examples but being taller isn't directly linked in examples to rearrest, so maybe low impact here.\n\nMarital status: He's not living alone. In Example #3, someone living alone had a YES outcome, so living with parents might be lower risk? Not sure yet; need more context.\n\nEducation level: No diploma or GED. Examples show some with no education had NO outcomes but others like Example #3 where he did have a diploma still had a YES. So lack of education is definitely a high factor here.\n\nEmployment history: He's held 2 jobs in the past year. In Example #1, someone with 4 jobs had NO outcome, so more job experience seems positive? Or maybe not directly related. Since he has none, it might be low but I'm not sure.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and hasn't felt depressed recently. In Examples, drug use can vary the risk, but here since he's using, but no severe depression, maybe moderate risk.\n\nHousehold at young age: Lived with mother in a household of 4 rural area. In Example #3, someone living with parents had higher risk when considering recidivism. So this could be high risk because of family environment issues.\n\nReligion: Doesn't consider God as influencing his life. In Examples, those who don't believe might have lower risk? Or maybe not directly linked. Not sure how to rate that.\n\nPutting it all together: High number of arrests (5) and no education would likely push towards a high risk. Drug use is present but minimal depression, so moderate effect. Living with family in a rural area could be significant. Marital status isn't clear, maybe medium impact.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested 5 times without any convictions, which significantly increases the risk of recidivism compared to similar cases with fewer arrests and convictions.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, which is a significant factor in predicting rearrest as individuals without education often face barriers in reentering society successfully.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"He is currently living with someone other than his spouse, but this factor alone may not be a strong indicator without more context on the relationship's stability or any issues that might arise from living apart.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"He has held 2 jobs during the year; while employment can contribute to financial stability and reentry plans, the low number of jobs does not necessarily indicate a high risk of rearrest without additional factors like job type or hours worked.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana but has not felt depressed over the past month.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 5 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.
