    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested seven times and convicted\u2014higher number of arrests usually correlate with higher risk, but in the examples given, even four convictions didn't lead to a YES outcome. So maybe seven counts this high would push it towards YES?\n\nHe's 5'4\" and weighs 130 lbs. In Example 2, someone similar age, Hispanic, not convicted, and lower weight had NO. But his weight is on the lower end; not sure how that affects.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014Example 2 was also never married and alone with NO outcome. That's a negative factor but perhaps not as strong in this case.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED\u2014not enrolled in college, which might indicate lower educational stability. In Example 3, someone with a diploma had YES, so maybe this is a contributing factor.\n\nHe held only one job last year\u2014Example 2 didn't work any jobs and NO outcome. Unemployment can lead to more time spent on substance abuse or other issues.\n\nNo drug use in past four years\u2014this seems positive; no recidivism related to substance abuse here, as seen in Examples where drug use was a factor but this case doesn't have it.\n\nHe's not depressed for the past month\u2014it's a mitigating factor. In Example 3, he felt down and had YES, so his current mental state is good.\n\nLived with biological mother alone at age young\u2014in rural area\u2014maybe living with parents reduces stress, as seen in Examples where living with family was associated with NO outcomes.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with him\u2014positive factor for mental health; Example 3 had this and YES outcome. So his belief is a good sign.\n\nPutting it all together: He's been arrested seven times (high), but not convicted, which might be lower risk than four convictions in Example 3 leading to YES. His job history is bad (1 job) with no drug use or depression\u2014positive factors. But the number of prior arrests and lack of educational background could tip it towards YES.\n\nI'm leaning towards a high confidence of YES because despite some mitigating factors, multiple arrest counts might increase the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of prior convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has been convicted seven times, which is a significant number indicating past criminal behavior and higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Age and height\", \"low\", \"Standing at 5 feet 4 inches with a lower weight of 130 lbs may indicate physical stability, though age alone doesn't determine risk.\"),\n    (\"Marital status and living arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse can be isolating but does not directly correlate with high recidivism risk if other factors are mitigated\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"Without a high school diploma or GED, this indicates potential instability in educational opportunities which could contribute to higher risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"Employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job during the past year may indicate limited opportunities for growth and stability, contributing to moderate risk\"),\n    (\"Drug use history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests good sobriety and lower risk factors related to substance abuse\"),\n    (\"Mental health status\", \"high mitigating factor\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month indicates positive mental health which can mitigate recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Household living conditions at young age\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of four may provide stability and reduce stress, contributing to lower risk\"),\n    (\"Belief in God's influence on his personal life\", \"high mitigating factor\", \"His belief that God has something to do with his life can positively influence mental health and behavior, reducing risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 130 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
