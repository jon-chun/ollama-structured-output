Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a significant arrest history\u201411 times arrested and 11 convictions. That's really high, so that should be a strong indicator of past problematic behavior, which could increase his chances of reoffending.\n\nHis weight is over 200 lbs, which might raise concerns about health issues or substance abuse, both of which can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's living alone and never married, which suggests he might not have the support system needed to stay on track. Plus, he has no education, so maybe he's in a situation where he doesn't have the skills or resources to avoid criminal behavior again.\n\nHis drug use history is concerning\u2014he used marijuana and now feels very depressed frequently. This could impair his ability to make positive decisions and contribute to further issues.\n\nHe lived in a household of five at a young age, which might indicate growing up in an environment with less supervision or fewer opportunities for positive experiences that could aid in avoiding criminal behavior.\n\nHis belief in God is mentioned as something unrelated to his current personal issues. While religion can influence behavior, in this case, it doesn't seem directly related to his current challenges.\n\nAll these factors point towards a high risk of reoffending within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"He has been arrested 11 times and convicted, indicating significant past criminal behavior which can predict future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"His weight of 210 lbs may contribute to health issues or substance abuse, both factors that influence recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"high\", \"Living alone with no spouse suggests he may lack support systems necessary for staying sober and law-abiding.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED, which could hinder his ability to secure stable employment and avoid criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"jobs held\", \"low\", \"He has held no jobs during the year, leaving him with limited income potential and opportunities for positive engagement.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"His history of marijuana use and current depression may impair decision-making and increase the likelihood of engaging in harmful behaviors.\"),\n    (\"household size at age\", \"high\", \"Living in a household of 5 at a young age may have contributed to his current challenges, such as substance abuse or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"His belief that God has nothing to do with his personal issues appears unrelated to recidivism risk, as this factor does not predict criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 11 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 5. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
