    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by analyzing each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who's White. She has been arrested once but not convicted. Her weight and height are within average ranges, which doesn't immediately raise red flags in terms of physical factors. She's living alone, which might be a bit concerning if she seems unstable or isolated.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, so her education level is good. That usually correlates with lower recidivism because educated individuals are more likely to seek help or have better job opportunities. She's held one job during the year, which also suggests some stability.\n\nHer drug use history includes cocaine from the past four years but no depressed feelings recently. Cocaine use can be problematic and might lead to relapse, so that's a potential risk factor. However, since she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, it might indicate she's managing her situation better than someone who feels heavily depressed.\n\nShe lived with both parents at age 19, which is a stable living environment. Household size of four doesn't seem like a significant issue on its own. And considering that God plays a role in her life, she has some support system, which might help in avoiding negative outcomes.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors pointing towards a higher risk are: one arrest (though not convicted), drug use history, and living alone without any indication of strong support or stability beyond her education. However, her age is quite young, 19, which can sometimes be associated with more impulsive decisions that might lead to recidivism.\n\nConsidering the balance of these factors, I'm leaning towards a medium-high risk of rearrest in the next three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"19-year-old female indicates she is relatively young and may be more prone to impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest but not a conviction, suggesting no active criminal history in the past year.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Use of cocaine in the past four years could increase risk of relapse or substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a strong support network may contribute to isolation and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"High school diploma with college enrollment suggests good educational stability and future opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"One job held during the year indicates some level of employment stability, though it's limited compared to full-time work.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression over the past month could suggest better mental health management than others.\"),\n    (\"Family History\", \"high\", \"Lived with both biological parents at age 19 in a household of size 4, providing a stable living environment.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 165 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
