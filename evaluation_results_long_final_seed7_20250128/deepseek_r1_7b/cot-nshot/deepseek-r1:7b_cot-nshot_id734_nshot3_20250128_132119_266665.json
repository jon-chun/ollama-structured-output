    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this case. The person is a 21-year-old male who's White, arrested four times with a conviction, weighs 215 lbs, 5'10\", living alone, has a high school diploma and is in college, no jobs, used marijuana, felt down recently, lived in a household of six at a young age, and doesn't believe in God.\n\nLooking at the examples provided:\n\nExample #1 had someone with similar demographics but not many convictions. He didn't get rearrested. So maybe having more arrests is a risk factor.\n\nExample #2 was someone with no prior convictions, living alone, no job, no drug use\u2014no recidivism either. But in this case, the person has four prior arrests and is in college, which might increase the risk.\n\nThe third example had three prior arrests but still didn't recommit. However, in our case, it's four arrests with more factors like drug use and feeling down, which could be higher risk.\n\nSo, considering each factor:\n\n- Four prior convictions: High\n- Weight 215 lbs (moderate), height 5'10\" (average)\n- Living alone: Low to medium? Maybe Medium since it's a risk.\n- Education: High school diploma but enrolled in college\u2014maybe Medium if he's not doing well academically, but it could be a positive. The example with high school and no college didn't recidivate, so maybe that's a mitigating factor.\n- No jobs: Low\n- Drug use (marijuana): Medium risk as other examples without drug use didn't reoffend.\n- Recent feelings of down mood: High risk because of the emotional state.\n- Household size 6 at young age: Maybe medium? Previous example with smaller household didn't reoffend, but larger families might have different dynamics. Not sure about this one.\n\nPutting it all together, the four prior arrests and recent negative emotions seem like strong indicators for a high risk. The fact that he's in college could be a positive, but given the other factors, I lean towards a high confidence of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has four prior convictions, which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years can contribute to substance abuse issues, which are often linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Recent feelings of depression may indicate underlying mental health issues that could lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of six as a youth might have influenced current living situation, but it's not directly linked to recidivism compared to other factors like prior convictions and drug use.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"While the individual has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, this factor alone does not significantly mitigate risk without additional context on academic performance or engagement.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 215 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 6. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
