    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the risk factors provided. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who's White. He's been arrested once and convicted. That's a solid red flag because being arrested even once can increase the chances of reoffending. Age-wise, 18 might still be in a phase where he's exploring options, but conviction counts do matter.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 210 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height or weight are typically considered in risk assessments unless there's a history of substance abuse, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence support systems, but since he's not in a relationship or with family nearby, that might actually help him stay out of trouble.\n\nEnrolled in school now. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. So this is a positive factor that should reduce the risk.\n\nHe held 2 jobs during the year. Job experience can be beneficial as it shows responsibility and ability to support himself, which are good indicators for not getting into trouble again.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's great because substance abuse is a major contributor to recidivism. His current mental health status is mixed\u2014he feels down sometimes but doesn't necessarily have a history of depression unless this recent period is significant. Since he didn't use drugs, that itself is a positive indicator.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of 8 in an urban area. Large households can sometimes correlate with higher risk because there might be more people to turn to if something happens, but since he's not living with them now and it's specified as urban, which could have different dynamics compared to rural areas.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. This is a positive factor because religious involvement often correlates with better moral decision-making and higher self-esteem, which can reduce the risk of reoffending.\n\nPutting all these together: One conviction counts against him but maybe not heavily since he's 18 and has some mitigating factors like being in school, no drug use, and a positive outlook. The living situation is concerning because it's alone with urban surroundings, but his current stable environment might help. His education and job experience are strong positives.\n\nI think the risk here isn't too high, but there could be room for improvement. I would assign some weight to each factor\u2014conviction maybe medium, living alone low, school medium, jobs medium, drugs low (since none), mental health mixed but positive, household size maybe low because it's urban and he's not with his parents anymore.\n\nSo considering all this, the prediction might lean towards NO, meaning no rearrest within three years. The confidence would be based on how many factors are pointing in each direction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Conviction History\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a conviction history, which can increase recidivism risk but is mitigated by his age and current stable environment.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may initially be seen as a negative factor, but since he is in a stable urban setting and not living with the biological parents, this factor does not significantly contribute to increased risk.\"),\n    (\"Enrolled in School\", \"medium\", \"Currently enrolled in school can indicate a positive outlook and ability to support himself, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Held 2 jobs during the year, which is a positive indicator of responsibility and self-sufficiency.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years, which significantly reduces the risk of substance abuse-related offenses.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"mixed\", \"Reported feeling down but no history of depression; this factor does not strongly indicate a high risk without further evidence of recent distress.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 18\", \"low\", \"Lived with both parents in a household of 8, which may have different dynamics compared to current living arrangements, contributing minimally to risk but not significantly positive either.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 210 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 8, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
