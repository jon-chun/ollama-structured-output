    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this new case based on the examples given. Let me start by looking at each of the previous examples to see how their risk factors contributed to their outcomes.\n\nIn Example #1, the person is a Hispanic male with several negative factors like drug use and living in a big household. He had a high school diploma but still ended up not being rearrested. Wait, no, actually his outcome was NO, meaning he didn't get rearrested. So having certain risk factors can sometimes lead to not getting rearrested.\n\nLooking at Example #2, there's a Black male who wasn't convicted despite an arrest and lived alone without any jobs or drugs. His outcome was also NO. This might suggest that not being convicted is linked to lower recidivism, but it's not always the case because other factors can influence it too.\n\nIn Example #3, a White male with multiple negative risk factors like drug use, feeling down, and living in a rural area did get rearrested (YES). So this indicates that some risk factors can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nNow, looking at the current case: an 18-year-old White female. She's never been married, living alone, enrolled in school, held one job, used marijuana, felt down recently, and lived with her biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. She believes God has something to do with her life.\n\nI'll need to assign weights to each risk factor. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n1. Age: 18 is relatively young, which might be considered low risk because younger individuals often have more options and may not engage in criminal activities as much.\n2. Hispanic origin? No, she's White. So no risk there.\n3. Arrests: She was arrested once but not convicted. This could be a mitigating factor since not being convicted reduces the chances of rearrest compared to a conviction.\n4. Height and weight: 5'5\" and 156 lbs \u2013 not particularly concerning unless there's an issue with health, which isn't mentioned here.\n5. Marital status: Never married, living alone \u2013 this could be protective as single individuals might avoid certain social dynamics that could lead to issues.\n6. Education: Enrolled in school \u2013 ongoing education is generally positive and can contribute to better job opportunities and stability.\n7. Jobs held: One during the year \u2013 having a steady job can provide financial stability and reduce stress, which are protective factors.\n8. Drug use: marijuana only in the past four years \u2013 moderate use might not be severe enough to be a major risk factor, but it's still something to consider.\n9. Emotional state: She feels down recently. This could indicate some mental health issues or stressors that may affect her behavior and increase recidivism chances.\n10. Household size: Small household in rural area \u2013 smaller households often have less support networks which can be risk factors, but rural areas might offer different dynamics compared to urban areas.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the emotional state (feeling down) seems like a significant risk factor here because it could indicate underlying issues that contribute to recidivism. The fact that she's young and otherwise relatively stable adds some protective aspects, but her recent emotional state isn't entirely clear\u2014whether it's anxiety or depression or something else.\n\nPutting this together, while most factors are either mitigating or neutral (like being White, not convicted), the emotional state is a bit concerning. It might weigh towards a medium risk because although she has no prior convictions, her emotional state could influence future behavior. However, since she's in school and has a job, these positive factors could balance it out.\n\nI think overall, considering all the weighted factors, this person might have a low to medium risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"18-year-old individuals are generally considered at lower risk for recidivism due to their ability to seek help and access education opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Hispanic Origin\", \"low\", \"She is White, so this factor does not apply.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"low\", \"One non-convicted arrest may be a mitigating factor as it reduces the chances of rearrest compared to a conviction.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"No significant concerns related to her height (5'5\") and weight (156 lbs).\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married could be seen as a risk factor due to potential isolation, though it's not directly tied to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"high\", \"Currently enrolled in school, which is generally protective against recidivism by promoting stability and positive influences.\"),\n    (\"Jobs Held\", \"medium\", \"One job during the year may provide some income stability but could also be a source of stress if it's unstable or demanding.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Only marijuana use in the past four years, which is not severe and thus less likely to contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State\", \"high\", \"Feeling down recently could indicate potential mental health issues that may increase behavior instability and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Household Size/Habitation\", \"medium\", \"Small household in a rural area, which might offer different social dynamics but can also be associated with increased stress or isolation.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 156 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
