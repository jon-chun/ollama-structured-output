    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 18-year-old male based on his risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with one arrest had a \"NO\" outcome, except maybe when other factors changed it. So that might be low to medium weight because one arrest is significant but not a guarantee.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 159 lbs. Weight isn't usually a big risk factor unless it's extreme, which it's not here, so this might be low.\n\nNever married living alone. In the examples, being single wasn't always a bad sign, especially if he's young, but maybe it adds some risk? Maybe medium.\n\nHigh school diploma and enrolled in college. College enrollment can sometimes indicate higher self-control or better opportunities, which is usually protective, so probably low to no weight here.\n\nHe's held 1 job during the year. Having work experience can be positive, so maybe low.\n\n drug use: marijuana and cocaine in past four years but not in last month. That could increase risk if he's using currently. The examples didn't have this exact case, but frequent substance use often correlates with higher recidivism. So medium weight here.\n\nNo depression felt in the past month. This is a protective factor because if someone isn't depressed, it suggests better mental health. Maybe low.\n\nAt young age, lived with his biological mother in a household of 5 in an urban area. Urban areas might have more resources or higher crime, so that could be medium to high risk depending on the context.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. This is actually protective because it shows a strong moral compass, so maybe low weight.\n\nPutting this all together: one arrest, no previous convictions\u2014so that's low. His job experience is positive but he's only held one. His living situation in an urban area with multiple people could be high risk. Substance use might add to the risk if he's currently using drugs. But his lack of depression and college enrollment are protective factors.\n\nI think the dominant factor here is his recent living situation in a large urban household, which could expose him to higher stress or environments that might lead to issues. The substance use isn't severe but still contributes. So maybe there's a moderate risk here.\n</think>\n\nHere's the analysis based on each risk factor and their relative weights:\n\n1. **Number of Arrests**: Low - 1 arrest without a conviction is significant but not definitive.\n2. **Height and Weight**: Low - No extreme factors related to physical appearance.\n3. **Marital Status and Living Alone**: Medium - Being single, though young, could be slightly concerning.\n4. **Education Level**: Low - High school diploma with college enrollment adds a protective factor.\n5. **Employment History**: Low - 1 job is positive but not substantial.\n6. **Substance Use**: Medium - Past use of marijuana and cocaine may increase risk if present now.\n7. **Mental Health**: Low - No depression felt, indicating good mental health.\n8. **Living Situation**: High - Urban household with multiple people could be high-risk.\n9. **Belief in God**: Low - Strong moral compass is protective.\n\nConsidering the factors, especially the urban living situation which might contribute to higher stress or risk environments, the overall prediction leans towards a moderate risk of recidivism within three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"1 arrest without a conviction is significant but not definitive.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"No extreme factors related to physical appearance.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Being single, though young, could be slightly concerning.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma with college enrollment adds a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"1 job is positive but not substantial.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine may increase risk if present now.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression felt, indicating good mental health.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Urban household with multiple people could be high-risk.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Strong moral compass is protective.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 159 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
