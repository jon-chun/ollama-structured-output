    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this risk assessment for a 19-year-old female who's Black. She has been arrested once but not convicted. She weighs 145 lbs and is 5'5\". She's living alone with no spouse, no kids as far as I can tell from the data. Her education level is low\u2014no high school diploma or GED\u2014and she's not in college. She's held three jobs this year.\n\nHer drug use: she's used marijuana in the past four years, and most of the time during the last month, she felt really down. That's a strong negative indicator because substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nShe comes from a household of five at a young age, which might suggest some instability or stress that could impact her behavior or ability to make good decisions. Her belief in God is something positive, but I'm not sure if that directly affects recidivism unless there are other factors related to her spirituality and how it influences her actions.\n\nLooking back at the examples provided:\n\nExample 1: A Hispanic male with a clean record, living with spouse, married, high school diploma. He used drugs sometimes but didn't feel depressed in the last month. Outcome was NO. So being in a stable household and having a positive outlook on life might lower recidivism.\n\nExample 2: Black male, not convicted despite an arrest, living alone, no job, no drug use, no high school diploma. Outcome was NO. So not being convicted isn't a strong risk factor here either.\n\nExample 3: White male, arrested three times without convictions, heavy drug use (marijuana and cocaine), negative outlook on life due to feeling down. He had a higher recidivism outcome (YES). So more negative factors like multiple arrests, substance use, and a bad outlook increase the risk.\n\nIn this case, she has multiple negative factors: prior arrest, no education, unemployment or underemployment for three jobs, drug use (marijuana), and a negative emotional state. The positive factors are living alone with no spouse, and her belief in God.\n\nComparing to the examples, her risk factors seem similar to Example 3 but without as much of the heavy drug use. She has some mitigating factors like not being convicted yet, but she's still at risk from other aspects like unemployment, lack of education, and emotional instability.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest (1 time but not convicted)\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk due to past criminal history which can influence future behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (No HS diploma/GED, not enrolled in college)\", \"low\", \"Low risk as higher education often correlates with better job prospects and decision-making abilities.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status (Held 3 jobs during the year)\", \"medium\", \"Medium risk; unemployment or underemployment can lead to unstable living situations and substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Used marijuana in past four years, felt down most of last month)\", \"high\", \"High risk; drug use is a significant indicator of potential substance abuse which can impact recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State (Felt so down in dumps, most of the time)\", \"high\", \"High risk; negative emotional state may correlate with poor decision-making and increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age (Household size 5)\", \"low\", \"Low risk; smaller household sizes often indicate more stable early life experiences which can influence later behavior.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Negative impact on recidivism risk as it may suggest a focus on positive values and away from potential negative influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, she lived in a household of size 5. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
