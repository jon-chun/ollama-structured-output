    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the risk factors for this 22-year-old Hispanic female. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's a significant positive risk factor because prior convictions are strong indicators of recidivism.\n\nHer weight is 155 lbs, which is within a healthy range for her height. No issues there.\n\nMarital status shows she's living with her spouse, so no mention of instability, which is a good sign.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. More employment can mean better support systems and less time spent on street activities.\n\nNo drug use history or feelings of depression in the past month suggests she's mentally stable, which is favorable.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in an urban setting might have some social factors, but since she's now married and living stably, that's probably mitigated.\n\nBelief in God as influencing her life could be seen positively if it indicates a sense of purpose or support, but sometimes religion can also lead to risky behaviors. However, given the context, this is more of a positive factor here.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some mitigating factors like education and stable living situation, the primary risk comes from her prior conviction. Without further negative factors, I lean towards a low recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has been arrested once and has been convicted, which is a significant factor in predicting recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight_category\", \"low\", \"Her weight of 155 lbs for her height of 5 feet 5 inches falls within the healthy range, indicating no physical risk factors.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"She is living with her spouse, which suggests a stable environment and no signs of domestic conflict or instability.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which correlates with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\" employment_history\", \"medium\", \"She has held 3 jobs during the year, indicating some financial stability but also potential lack of economic dependency.\"),\n    (\"drug Use_history\", \"low\", \"She has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month, showing no recent substance abuse issues.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No mention of depression or negative mental health indicators in the past month, suggesting good mental stability.\"),\n    (\"household_size_at_age_of_arrival\", \"low\", \"She lived with both her biological parents at a young age, indicating a stable early life experience, despite living alone now.\"),\n    (\"religion_effective_influncing_life\", \"medium\", \"Her belief in God influencing her life could be seen as positive due to its potential to provide support and stability, but it's not directly linked to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as Hispanic. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 155 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
