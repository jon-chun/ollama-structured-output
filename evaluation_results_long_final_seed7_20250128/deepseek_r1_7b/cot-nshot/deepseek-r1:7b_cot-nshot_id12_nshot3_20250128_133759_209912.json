    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the given examples and my analysis of the risk factors. Let me start by going through each example to understand what contributes to a 'YES' or 'NO' outcome.\n\nIn Example #1, the person has a high school diploma, isn't employed in college, holds 4 jobs, no drug use, and lives with his spouse. The outcome is NO rearrest. So, education level and stable living environment seem protective here.\n\nExample #2: This person didn't get a conviction despite being arrested once, doesn't have a high school diploma, lives alone, has no jobs, but also hasn't used drugs. His living situation was with his biological mother in an urban area, and he believes God isn't involved. The outcome is NO rearrest. Interesting, so even though some factors are worse here, the outcome is still low.\n\nExample #3: This person has multiple prior arrests (3), uses both marijuana and cocaine, feels very down, lives with both parents in a rural area, and doesn't believe in God. The outcome is YES rearrest. So higher recidivism when there's more history of arrests, drug use, emotional distress, and living in a rural household without religious involvement.\n\nNow, looking at the case to predict:\n\n- Age: 20, Black, arrested once not convicted.\n- Height/Weight: 6ft1in, 174 lbs. Not relevant here except for physical presence but doesn't affect recidivism directly.\n- Living situation: Alone, never married, no children since living alone.\n- Education: High school diploma and enrolled in college. This is good as Example #2 shows those without a diploma have higher risk, even if they live alone.\n- Jobs: Held 3 jobs during the year. More stable income can help with recidivism.\n- Drug use: Past four years only marijuana, some recent severe mood swings. Past drug use can be a risk factor but not always directly leading to rearrest unless it's frequent or severe.\n- Family history: Lived with biological mother in an urban area at a young age. Urban areas might have different social networks and support systems compared to rural areas, which could affect outcomes differently.\n\nConsidering the factors:\n\n1. Prior Arrests: Only one arrest, not convicted. Example #2 also had no conviction but outcome was NO. However, in Example #3, multiple arrests led to a YES.\n2. Drug Use: Past use of marijuana and current mood issues. In Example #3, drug use was a significant factor leading to YES.\n3. Family History: Urban living with biological mother might offer more support than rural areas did for Example #3.\n4. Education: High school diploma plus college enrollment suggests good opportunities which can positively influence behavior.\n\nSo the risk factors here are:\n- Prior arrest (1, not convicted): Medium\n- Drug use (marijuana and mood): Medium to High? Because past drug use was a factor in Example #3 leading to YES.\n- Emotional distress: High because severe mood swings were present.\n- Living situation: Alone might be protective but urban vs rural could mitigate that.\n\nPutting it all together, the high emotional distress from drug use and possibly previous behavior could tip this towards a YES. The person is Black, which in Example #2 didn't lead to YES despite living alone. So considering all factors, maybe lean towards YES with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"The individual has only been arrested once but not convicted, which is a protective factor as seen in Example #2 where similar circumstances resulted in NO rearrest.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"The individual has used marijuana and experienced severe mood swings, which can be a risk factor that contributes to recidivism, as seen in Example #3 where drug use was linked to YES rearrest.\"),\n    (\"emotional_distress\", \"high\", \"The individual reported feeling extremely down during the past month, which is a significant concern and aligns with Example #3's factors leading to a YES outcome.\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"low\", \"Living in an urban area with his biological mother may provide social support that could mitigate risk compared to rural living seen in Example #3.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
