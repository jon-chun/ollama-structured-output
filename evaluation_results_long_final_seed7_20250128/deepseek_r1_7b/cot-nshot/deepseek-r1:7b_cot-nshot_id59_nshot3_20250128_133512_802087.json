    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the risk factors provided. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: He's 19 years old. Younger individuals are often at higher risk because they're still developing skills and facing life challenges. So that might be a high-risk factor.\n\nEthnicity: Hispanic. From what I know, some studies show that Hispanic males have higher recidivism rates compared to other ethnic groups, so this could be a medium or high factor.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He's been arrested once and is convicted. That's a clear indicator of past behavior issues which can predict future criminal activity. High risk here.\n\nWeight: 200-224 lbs at 5'9\". Weight categories can vary, but being overweight might be associated with health issues that could affect job performance or substance use. Medium-high risk?\n\nMarital status: He's never been married and is living alone. Living in a single status without support can lead to higher stress and dependency on substances, increasing recidivism. High risk.\n\nEmployment: He's enrolled in school but hasn't held any jobs during the year. Joblessness often correlates with substance use and lack of skills, so this should be high risk.\n\nDrug use: He used cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a significant factor in criminal behavior and can lead to more arrests or severe convictions. High risk here.\n\nHousehold size at young age: He lived with both parents in a household of five, which was urban. Smaller households sometimes offer more support, but living in a large family might mean less individual responsibility for decision-making. Maybe medium risk?\n\nReligion: Doesn't consider God affecting his life. This could be positive or negative. Some might feel more anchored in faith and have better coping mechanisms, while others might rely on religion for support which isn't present here. Medium risk.\n\nSo putting it all together, most factors are high to medium except maybe the household size and religion. The prior conviction is a strong indicator of past issues. Drug use and being under 20 years old also point towards higher risk. Therefore, I would predict a YES outcome with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which places them in a vulnerable age group prone to developing skills and facing life challenges that may contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic males have historically shown higher recidivism rates compared to other ethnic groups, indicating a medium risk factor.\"),\n    (\"Number of Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"Conviction for one arrest suggests past criminal activity which can predict future criminal behavior and reoffending.\"), \n    (\"Weight\", \"medium-high\", \"Living within a weight range that could potentially be associated with health issues that may impact job performance or substance use.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"high\", \"Living alone without a spouse increases stress levels, dependency on substances, and potential for substance abuse which can contribute to recidivism.\"), \n    (\"Employment\", \"high\", \"Not holding any jobs during the year indicates a lack of financial stability and support system which may increase risk of substance use or involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of cocaine in the past four years, along with not feeling depressed over the past month, points towards substance abuse issues that are often correlated with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a household of five during early adulthood may indicate less individual responsibility for decision-making and potential challenges in developing life skills.\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"medium\", \"Not considering God as a factor influencing personal life could be either positive or negative, depending on the individual's support system and coping mechanisms.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
