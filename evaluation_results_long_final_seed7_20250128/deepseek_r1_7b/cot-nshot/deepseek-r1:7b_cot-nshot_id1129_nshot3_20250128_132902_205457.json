    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm faced with a task to analyze risk factors for recidivism using an example provided by the user. The case in question is of a 21-year-old Black male who has been arrested 18 times but hasn't been convicted yet. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his high number of arrests\u201418 times\u2014is really significant. In the examples given, someone with just one arrest didn't have a recidivism outcome, so 18 must be a strong indicator that he's likely to reoffend. That should probably be a high risk factor.\n\nNext, his living situation: he's living alone at age 21 in an urban area after living with his mother when he was younger in a household of seven. This might suggest instability or lack of support, which are known contributors to recidivism. So that's another high risk factor.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma and hasn't enrolled in college, which can hinder his employability and access to resources that might prevent him from getting involved with the criminal system again. That definitely points towards high risk.\n\nDrug use is another critical point\u2014he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have psychological effects and may lead to more impulsive behavior, increasing the chance of recidivism. This should be a high factor as well.\n\nHis belief that God has something to do with his personal events is interesting. While this might indicate a lack of existential crisis or purpose, it's not directly linked to recidivism in the examples provided. However, it might suggest some level of control or belief system that could either help or hinder, but I'm leaning towards low risk here.\n\nPutting all these together, his extensive criminal history and other factors like living alone, lack of education, and drug use are strong indicators pointing towards a high risk of recidivism within three years. His belief in God might not directly affect the outcome as much as the other factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 18 times, which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for future involvement in the criminal system.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone at age 21 suggests a lack of support network, which can contribute to instability and increased risk of reoffending, especially given his history of living with his biological mother in a household of seven earlier in life in an urban area.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED certificate, coupled with not enrolling in college despite being 21 years old, indicates limited access to educational resources and opportunities that could potentially deter criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug Use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, without recent feelings of depression, suggests potential for continued drug use which can have psychological effects and increase impulsivity, leading to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"religion Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief that God has something to do with his personal events may indicate a sense of control or purpose but does not directly correlate with increased recidivism risk compared to other factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 18 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
