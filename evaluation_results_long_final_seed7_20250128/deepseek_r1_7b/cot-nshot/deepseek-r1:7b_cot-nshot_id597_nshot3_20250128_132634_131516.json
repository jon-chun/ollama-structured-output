    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 22-year-old White male. He has a history of being arrested three times but not convicted. Let me break down his risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 22, which is relatively young, and he's had multiple arrests, so that might indicate some instability or prior negative experiences. His weight and height don't seem directly relevant here; maybe they could relate to other factors like substance use, but since he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, that's a good sign.\n\nHe's living alone with no children from his current marital status, which might suggest he's in a stable environment without family issues. His education is a GED and not enrolled in college; having some high school diploma could be seen as positive because it shows he has the qualifications but maybe isn't actively seeking further education or training.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year, which is a solid number. Having work experience can help with stability and provide skills that might aid in reintegration after any potential incarceration.\n\nHis living situation at a young age was with adults other than biological parents in a household of six, so that's a big family. That could have had both positive and negative effects\u2014family support could be a plus, but it might also indicate past instability or challenges, which could influence his current behavior.\n\nHe says he feels no depression recently, so that's another positive sign. His religious belief is that God has something to do with his life, which can sometimes provide a sense of purpose and stability, especially for individuals who find comfort in their faith.\n\nLooking at the examples provided earlier, even though this person has more prior arrests than some, the other factors like education level, job history, living situation, and mental health are all positive. In Example #1 and #2, people with fewer prior convictions but similar risk factors had a 'NO' outcome, suggesting that lower conviction rates can influence lower recidivism.\n\nConsidering his high school diploma and lack of recent issues, the low or medium risk would probably lean towards not reoffending. The job experience adds stability, which is another mitigating factor.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a history of three arrests, which could indicate past instability and may influence future behavior, but the lack of conviction in two cases might suggest partial accountability or possible rehabilitation efforts.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no children may imply a stable living situation, which can reduce stress and external influences that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and not currently enrolled in college could suggest a focus on self-improvement or seeking alternative paths, reducing the likelihood of returning to criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding three jobs during the past year indicates a stable work history that can provide economic independence and skills applicable for reintegration efforts, further mitigating recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements at Age\", \"low\", \"Residing with other adults in a household of six, though larger than some examples provided, could indicate family support or potential challenges but may also suggest social stability.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Status\", \"low\", \"No recent depression and feeling no down mood suggests positive mental health, which is favorable for reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"high\", \"Considering God has something to do with his life can provide a sense of purpose and stability, further reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 6, in a rural area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
