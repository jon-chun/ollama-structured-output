    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this risk assessment case. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 19, which is quite young, often associated with higher recidivism rates because of impulsive decisions.\n\nRace: Hispanic background can sometimes correlate with higher arrest rates and longer time in custody, contributing to a riskier profile.\n\nNumber of arrests: Two convictions mean he's been in trouble before, increasing the likelihood of future offenses.\n\nWeight: 140 lbs isn't extreme, but his height is shorter (5'8\"), which might be linked to lower self-esteem issues.\n\nLiving situation: Living alone can lead to isolation and substance use issues. He's never married, so no support system.\n\nEducation: Currently enrolled in school could mean he's seeking better opportunities, reducing recidivism.\n\nJob experience: Only one job for a year isn't much, but perhaps he relies on it too heavily or is under employable age.\n\nDrug use: He admitted to cocaine use and felt very down. Cocaine can lead to dependency issues, which affect his ability to reintegrate.\n\nFamily background: At 13, living with a mother in a household of four suggests early family issues that might impact behavior.\n\nReligion: Believing God has no role could mean he's more likely to engage in self-harming or rebellious behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are high. High recidivism is expected based on these points.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 19 years old, a young age often associated with impulsive decisions and higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Hispanic background may correlate with higher arrest rates but this factor alone does not significantly increase risk compared to other factors\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"high\", \"Two convictions indicate past problematic behavior which can predict future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"medium\", \"A weight of 140 lbs, while not extreme, may be linked to certain health issues that could impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can lead to isolation and substance use issues, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in school suggests a focus on positive outcomes and reducing recidivism risk compared to other factors\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Held only one job for a year may indicate limited work history or reliance on this income source which could be problematic if inconsistent or insufficient.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Admission to cocaine use and significant emotional distress due to drug use can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"high\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of four at age 13 may indicate early family dysfunction that could impact behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Religion\", \"medium\", \"Believing God has no role can sometimes correlate with rebellious or self-destructive behaviors, increasing the risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
