    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this specific case. Let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: he's 19 years old. Younger individuals often have lower recidivism rates because they're still developing and more likely to change their behavior. So that might be a low risk factor.\n\nNext, race: he identifies as White. Generally, White individuals might have slightly higher recidivism rates compared to Black or Hispanic individuals, but it's not the most significant factor here.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Since he wasn't convicted, this doesn't count against him in terms of legal outcomes affecting his risk score.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet 0 inches and between 150-174 lbs. These factors usually don't have a direct impact on recidivism unless there's an issue with substance use or physical health, which isn't indicated here.\n\nMarital status: He's never been married and is living alone. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with higher rearrest rates, but instability can sometimes be linked to other risk factors like substance abuse or unemployment.\n\nEducation level: He has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education typically reduces recidivism, so this would be low risk.\n\nNumber of jobs held: He's held 4 jobs during the year. Having stable employment generally contributes to lower recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use history: He used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can sometimes lead to other issues like substance abuse problems, which might increase recidivism risk if he continues using or faces consequences for it.\n\nLifestyle at a young age: He lived with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in an urban area. Large households can sometimes correlate with higher stress levels and substance use, but without evidence of such issues here, it's probably low risk.\n\nBelief in God: He feels that God has something to do with his personal events. This might indicate a more stable mental health situation compared to someone who doesn't believe in a higher power, which could be a protective factor.\n\nPutting all this together, most factors are either low or medium. The only high risk would come from something like drug use history if it's problematic, but he hasn't indicated any recent issues. Therefore, I'm leaning towards NO for the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome with low confidence because while there are some minor red flags, they don't outweigh the protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 19 years old, which is a relatively young age and may be associated with lower recidivism rates due to their developmental stage.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"The individual identifies as White, which may slightly increase recidivism risk compared to Black or Hispanic individuals but isn't the most significant factor here.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"He has been arrested once without a conviction, so this does not count against him in terms of legal outcomes affecting his risk score.\"),\n    (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"His height (6 feet 0 inches) and weight (150-174 lbs.) do not directly correlate with recidivism based on provided information.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not inherently increase rearrest risk unless combined with other factors like substance abuse or instability.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which typically reduces recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"low\", \"Holding 4 jobs during the year generally contributes to lower recidivism risk through stable employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"low\", \"While he used marijuana in the past four years, there is no indication of recent substance abuse issues or depression, which might mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"Lifestyle at a Young Age\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of size 5 in an urban area does not inherently correlate with higher stress levels unless other factors are present.\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Feeling that God has something to do with his personal events may indicate a more stable mental health situation compared to others without such beliefs.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
