    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this risk assessment case. So first, let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who's White. She has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's two prior convictions in three years; that seems significant. Prior convictions can be a strong indicator of recidivism because it shows she's had some trouble before, which might make her more likely to repeat the behavior.\n\nShe weighs 135 lbs at 5'2\". I'm not sure if weight is a factor here, but maybe in terms of other areas like substance use. She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse can definitely contribute to recidivism because it can affect her ability to function or make decisions.\n\nShe's currently not living alone; she's with someone else. So no mention of unstable living situation, which might be a risk factor for substance use or other issues. But since she's with someone now, maybe that changes things a bit.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and she's not in college. That could mean she has less support system around education or career planning, which might lead to financial instability or other challenges contributing to recidivism.\n\nShe's held 4 jobs during the year. Having multiple job histories can sometimes indicate good work habits, but it also shows she has struggled to maintain steady employment, which is a risk factor on its own for various issues like debt or family responsibilities.\n\nFor the past month, she feels extremely down and can't cheer herself up at all. This level of emotional distress might be linked to substance abuse or perhaps an untreated mental health issue, both of which are strong predictors of recidivism.\n\nShe lived with adults other than biological parents in a household of 5 in an urban area. That's a larger household size, and living with multiple people can sometimes lead to issues like financial strain or neglect, especially if she's not involved with the parents anymore.\n\nShe believes that God has something to do with her personal happenings. This is interesting because religious beliefs can sometimes correlate with certain behaviors, but it's more about her personal outlook than a direct risk factor unless there are underlying issues related to religion or spirituality.\n\nPutting all this together: Prior convictions (high), substance use (high), employment history (moderate?), living situation (possibly high due to household size and not being with biological parents), emotional distress (high). The lack of support from education and family might lower some factors, but the high risk factors dominate. \n\nI think her risk is quite high for recidivism within three years because of prior convictions, multiple substance use issues, living in a larger household without close support networks, and severe emotional distress.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has been convicted once despite two arrests, indicating past criminal behavior which is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"Heavy use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, along with current distress, suggests ongoing behavioral issues that can lead to further legal or social complications.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"moderate\", \"Held four jobs but currently not working full-time; this instability may contribute to financial strain and increased risk of involvement in the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"high\", \"Lived with non-biological parents in a household of five, which could indicate neglect or lack of family support, further increasing risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Experienced extreme mood swings and inability to cope with stress, potentially linked to substance abuse issues and mental health concerns that can exacerbate criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Education & Family Support\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED; limited educational opportunities may lead to lack of skills and support, indirectly contributing to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs 135 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
