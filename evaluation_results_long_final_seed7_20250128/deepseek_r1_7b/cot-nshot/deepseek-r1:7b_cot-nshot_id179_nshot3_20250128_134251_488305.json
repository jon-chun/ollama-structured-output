    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 20 years old. From what I remember, younger individuals might have a higher recidivism rate because they're still developing their skills and responsibilities. The example cases had people around similar ages but different outcomes based on other factors. So this could be a medium risk factor contributing to a YES outcome.\n\nNext, race: She identifies as White. In the examples, White individuals sometimes had NO outcomes even with multiple arrests or living conditions. But she only has one arrest and hasn't been convicted yet. Maybe her background here isn't enough to tip it towards high risk.\n\nWeight: 160 lbs. I don't see a direct link between weight and recidivism unless it's related to substance use, which is another factor here. So maybe medium risk from this aspect.\n\nMarital status: She's living alone with no spouse or partner. The examples showed that being married can lead to NO outcomes, but living alone doesn't always mean high risk if other factors are favorable. So perhaps low risk contribution.\n\nEducation level: She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism because people are more likely to seek better opportunities or help. That's probably a low risk factor pushing towards NO.\n\nNumber of jobs held during the year: She's held only 1 job. Having recent stable employment might reduce recidivism, so that's another low risk factor supporting her case.\n\nDrug use history: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a significant risk factor because it impairs judgment and increases crime-related risks. However, since she hasn't felt depressed, maybe this isn't as severe as expected\u2014so medium risk here.\n\nHousehold size at a young age: She lived with her biological dad in a household of 5 in an urban area. Larger households might provide more support but could also mean less supervision if someone is not managing relationships well. Urban settings sometimes have higher crime rates, which can affect recidivism\u2014so maybe medium risk from this factor.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God has no influence on her life. This might indicate a lack of religious guidance or support, which could be a medium to high risk because people who don't have strong spirituality often rely more on other factors like substance use or family issues for decision-making.\n\nPutting it all together, the education level and job stability are positive signs pushing towards NO. Age is a consideration but not the strongest factor here. Drug use adds some risk, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe that's mitigated. The household size in an urban area might have some impact, but overall, her factors seem to lean more towards lower recidivism.\n\nSo my prediction is NO with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Young individuals may experience higher recidivism rates due to developing skills and responsibilities.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"White background in the examples did not strongly correlate with a high outcome, though other factors may influence this.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"No direct link between weight and recidivism unless related to substance use, which is another factor here.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone does not always indicate high risk if other positive factors are present, such as education or employment.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment typically correlate with lower recidivism due to seeking better opportunities or help.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs Held During the Year\", \"low\", \"Holding only one job may indicate recent stability, which is a positive factor for reduced recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"medium\", \"Past use of marijuana and cocaine can be a significant risk factor due to impaired judgment and crime-related risks, though she hasn't felt depressed recently.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at a Young Age\", \"medium\", \"Living in a larger household with an urban setting may provide more support but could also mean less supervision or exposure to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Considering God has no influence might indicate a lack of guidance, which can be a medium risk factor for substance use and decision-making issues\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 160 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
