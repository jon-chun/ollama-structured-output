    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case based on the examples given. Let me start by analyzing each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. She's been arrested once and convicted, which in Example #1 was also the case for a male with similar factors, but she has a high school diploma while he didn't have a GED or high school diploma. She's enrolled in college now, which might indicate better educational support compared to Example #2 where he wasn't enrolled.\n\nShe's living alone, like her counterpart in Example #3 who also lived alone, so that could be a factor contributing to higher risk as seen in the \"YES\" outcome there. Her height and weight don't seem directly relevant here, but age is 21, which might mean she's more experienced or has had more life events.\n\nShe's used drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years. The recidivism rate for drug users tends to be higher because substance abuse can impede employment and relationships, both of which are mitigating factors. In Example #3, someone who used drugs also had a \"YES\" outcome, so this could contribute positively.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, but that's a bit different from using drugs. I'm not sure how depression affects recidivism outcomes here; maybe it relates to mental health support or self-esteem.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both her parents in a household of five in a rural area, similar to Example #3 where someone from a larger household had a \"YES\" outcome. Living in a larger family might provide more supervision and emotional support, which could lower the risk, but it's also possible that being in a rural area affects access to resources.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her life, whereas in Example #2, someone who didn't believe in God had a \"NO\" outcome. So her belief in God might be seen as a protective factor here.\n\nPutting this all together: She's been convicted once (medium risk), high school diploma (low risk), living alone (medium to high risk). Drug use (high risk), and religious belief (protective). The education and being enrolled in college could lower the risk, but her drug use is significant. Her living situation might be contributing to higher risk.\n\nThe examples show that while factors like having a GED or not, living with parents, and not being religious can influence outcomes, it's not always straightforward. In this case, I'm leaning towards \"YES\" because of the high risk factors outweighing some protective ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"convicted_arrests\", \"medium\", \"She has been convicted once, which is a moderate risk factor compared to not being convicted as in Example #2 and having more convictions in Examples #1 and #3.\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college, which are protective factors that lower the risk of recidivism as seen in Example #2 where no diploma was present and Example #1 where a GED wasn't mentioned but she's now in college\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can increase risk due to potential isolation issues, similar to Example #3 who also lived alone but had a recidivism outcome of YES.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"She has used both marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a high risk factor contributing to recidivism as seen in Example #3 where drug use led to a YES outcome.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Her belief in God may provide some protective influence compared to someone who doesn't have such beliefs, as indicated by Example #2's 'NO' outcome when no religion was mentioned and she didn't feel depressed recently.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in a household of five is similar to Example #3, where this factor contributed to a YES outcome despite being a larger household.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
