    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old White male. Let's break down each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a conviction. That's definitely high risk because prior convictions are strong indicators of reoffending.\n\nHe's quite heavy at 260 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a mitigating factor if it's due to legitimate reasons like moving or health issues. But without more context, I'd lean towards medium risk here since it could also be an indicator of other issues.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 2 inches, which isn't necessarily a red flag unless there's a history of being a target for discrimination or abuse. So that might be low to no impact on the risk factors.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Being an only child or single can sometimes reduce stress and strain, so this factor is probably low in risk contribution.\n\nHis educational background: high school diploma not enrolled in college. Education level matters; having a diploma doesn't show any ongoing commitment, which might be a negative sign for future employment and reintegration.\n\nHe's held 5 jobs during the year. Having job experience can be positive as it shows adaptability and willingness to work, but if he's been unstable or not keeping up with previous roles, that could be a risk. Since he's never married, maybe some job instability is expected.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug abuse is a major red flag for recidivism as it increases the likelihood of engaging in further criminal behavior, especially if it's recent or frequent.\n\nHis mental health during the month was very low, feeling down most of the time without any positive emotions. This could be a sign of deeper issues that might affect his ability to function and make responsible decisions, leading to higher risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of three in an urban area at a young age. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or instability, which is something to consider but not a sure thing. Also, living with family could provide support and stability.\n\nConsidering God's influence as having nothing to do with his personal life. This might be a sign of lack of faith, which some believe could affect decision-making and moral compass, potentially increasing risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), weight (medium), no family issues (low), education (low), job history (medium), drug use (high), mental health (high), urban living (low to medium), and lack of God involvement (medium). The high factors like prior arrest, drug use, and mental health probably outweigh the lower ones. So I'd lean towards a YES outcome with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrest\", \"high\", \"The individual has one prior arrest and conviction which is a significant indicator of past criminal behavior and potential for reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"medium\", \"He weighs 260 lbs, which could indicate health issues or legitimate reasons for weight, but no specific mitigating factors are mentioned.\"),\n    (\"Family Structure\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of three suggests family stability and support, reducing potential risk factors related to family dynamics.\"),\n    (\"Educational Background\", \"low\", \"No college enrollment despite having a high school diploma, which may indicate a lack of commitment or willingness to pursue further education and skills.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"medium\", \"Held five jobs in the past year; job experience can be positive but could also suggest instability or difficulty maintaining consistent employment.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which is a strong indicator of substance abuse and potential for engaging in criminal activities related to drug use.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Felt down most of the month; mental health issues can impair judgment, decision-making, and ability to reintegrate into society successfully.\"),\n    (\"Urban Environment\", \"low\", \"Lived in an urban area at a young age which may correlate with higher crime rates or instability but not necessarily directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"God's Influence\", \"medium\", \"Believes God has nothing to do with his personal life, which some may interpret as a lack of guidance or support, potentially affecting decision-making and behavior.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White.
