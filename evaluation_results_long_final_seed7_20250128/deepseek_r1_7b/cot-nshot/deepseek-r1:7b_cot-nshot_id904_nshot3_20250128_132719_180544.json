    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this case using the risk factors from Examples 1, 2, and 3. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 22, which isn't too high, but in Examples, both 19-year-olds had NO outcomes except for Example 3 where he was White with multiple arrests. Maybe age doesn't play a big role here.\n\nRace: He's White. In the examples, White individuals sometimes had higher recidivism rates. Like Example 3 had YES after multiple arrests and drug use. So maybe race is a factor pointing towards a higher risk.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He has 1 arrest and it was a conviction. That's significant because more arrests usually mean higher risk, so this could be high weight.\n\nDrug use: He used cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Since he used drugs, that's a positive factor for recidivism, so high weight.\n\nLiving situation: He's married and living with his spouse. Being in a stable environment might lower risk, so maybe not as high weight.\n\nEDUCATION: He has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not having higher education could increase risk because maybe he's less likely to get job training or support, so medium-high.\n\nHousehold size at young age: He lived with 3 parents in a rural area. Smaller households might indicate more support but the rural setting could mean less resources, so maybe low weight.\n\nGod belief: He says God has nothing to do with his life. That's a positive for lower risk because religious factors can influence behavior, so this factor is probably low weight.\n\nMarital status and living situation are mixed. Being married might have a balancing effect on other negative factors like drug use or prior arrests.\n\nPutting it all together: He was convicted once, which is high. He used drugs recently but has no depression. Being White with multiple past issues could lean towards higher risk despite being in a stable home now. His GED and not attending college might contribute to lower educational support, so maybe medium-high risk.\n\nSo the prediction would be YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which falls within a typical age range for recidivism.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 156 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 3. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
