    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case for a 21-year-old Black female with various risk factors. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which might be considered low or medium risk depending on the context, but she's quite young, so maybe higher risk? But since she's only 21, that might not heavily impact rearrest recidivism yet.\n\nShe has a criminal history: 1 arrest and 1 conviction. That\u2019s a significant factor because prior convictions are strong predictors of future involvement.\n\nHer height is 5'5\", weight 160 lbs; nothing jumps out as extreme here.\n\nLiving alone, never married\u2014these stable living conditions can be protective, so maybe lower risk there.\n\nNo education: She has no high school diploma or GED. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates because it might limit opportunities and contribute to substance use issues.\n\nNo job experience during the year\u2014that's a red flag. Joblessness is linked to unstable living situations and higher chances of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana use, but no cocaine. Past four years\u2014so she has a history of drug use. Substance abuse can increase recidivism because it can lead to other criminal behaviors or complicate family dynamics.\n\nMood: She feels down for much of the month. This could indicate depression or anxiety, which are mental health issues that might contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors.\n\nHousehold size at 6 with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban living can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates but also offer more opportunities. A larger household might suggest she has support, but if the environment is unstable, it could be a risk factor.\n\nGod involvement: She believes God has something to do with her life. That's generally seen as protective against recidivism because spirituality often correlates with better decision-making and lower substance use.\n\nPutting this all together, most of these factors are pointing towards a higher risk. The prior arrest and conviction, lack of education, drug use, living situation alone (with no support), and mood issues are significant red flags. While her belief in God is protective, the other factors outweigh that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which may be considered a relatively low risk age for recidivism given their youth and potential for future development.\"),\n    (\"Prior Criminal History\", \"high\", \"She has 1 prior arrest and 1 conviction, indicating a history of involvement in the criminal system, which can increase the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Lifestyle Factors\", \"low\", \"Living alone with no spouse or partner may suggest a stable living situation that could be protective against certain risk factors.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 160 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
