    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze this case where an 18-year-old Black male has been arrested four times and convicted. His weight is in a certain range, he's living alone without a high school diploma or GED, has only held one job, uses drugs, feels depressed sometimes, and lived with non-biological parents in a urban area of household size five.\n\nLooking at the examples provided:\n\nExample 1: A 21-year-old Hispanic male with similar factors but fewer arrests. Outcome was NO.\n\nExample 2: A Black male with no prior convictions or arrests, other risk factors not present; outcome also NO.\n\nExample 3: White male, more arrests and drug use, some depression, living alone, but outcome was YES.\n\nNow, this case has multiple high-risk factors:\n\n- Prior Arrests (4): High\n- Drug Use (marijuana and cocaine): High\n- Unemployed/Not enrolled in school for a year with only 1 job: Medium to High\n- Past Depression: High\n- Living Arrangement: Urban, household size 5 with non-biological parents: High\n\nWhile he's Black, which might be a mitigating factor depending on the model. He has no education, which is another negative.\n\nPutting these together, his recidivism risk seems high based on multiple factors contributing.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested four times and has a conviction, indicating significant criminal history which typically correlates with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Regular use of marijuana and cocaine is strongly associated with increased risk of reoffending, as substance abuse often stems from underlying behavioral issues that may contribute to delinquency.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job during the year suggests instability, which can lead to economic stressors and potentially higher recidivism rates.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with adults other than biological, foster or adoptive parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
