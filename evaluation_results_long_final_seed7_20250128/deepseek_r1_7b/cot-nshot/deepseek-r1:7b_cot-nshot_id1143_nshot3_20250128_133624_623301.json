    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm going to analyze each risk factor from the provided example cases and then apply those weights to the current scenario.\n\nFirst, looking at Example #1: The person has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. In their case, they didn't get rearrested (Outcome: NO). So, education level here is probably low risk since it's a positive factor.\n\nIn Example #2: This individual hasn't been convicted yet but has no job experience or prior drug use. They also had no issues and weren't living in a household of 5 with their mom, so that might be a low risk as well.\n\nExample #3 is the opposite; multiple arrests, drug use, negative emotions, and living alone led to a recidivism (Outcome: YES). So, factors like past convictions, drug use, and emotional distress are high risk.\n\nNow, looking at the current case:\n\nAge: 21. Example cases had similar ages except for Example #3 which was 19 but still high risk due to other factors.\nRace: Hispanic. From Examples #1 and #3, being Hispanic didn't directly correlate with rearrest; it's more about other factors.\n\nArrests: 1 time, not convicted. Comparing to Example #2 who had similar stats and no issue, so this is low risk but perhaps some influence from race.\n\nHeight and weight: Not sure how they affect recidivism in these examples.\nMarital status: Living alone. In Examples #2 and #3, living alone was associated with lower or higher risk depending on other factors. It's a bit neutral here.\nEducation: No diploma/GED. This is similar to Example #2, who had no issues despite this factor.\n\nJobs held: 1 job. Low number of jobs might indicate instability, which could be medium risk but in the context of Examples, maybe not as impactful without other factors like drug use or living situation.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana and cocaine. This is a significant factor, especially since Example #3 had similar drug use and higher risk. Here, it's high risk because of past substance abuse.\n\nEmotional distress: Not felt over the past month. But they've used drugs in the past four years. Emotional state can influence behavior, but with no current distress, maybe lower risk.\n\nHousehold size at age of arrest: 7 in an urban area vs Example #2 which was similar and had no issues. So this factor might be low risk as it's a larger household.\n\nGod involvement: No belief. In the recidivism context, lack of spirituality isn't directly tied to rearrest unless other factors are present.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nDrug use is a high risk (similar to Example #3). The individual has only one job and lives alone, which might be medium, but without other significant factors, it's likely to lead to a higher chance. Considering the past four years of drug use and no current distress despite not feeling down, maybe slightly medium.\n\nSo overall, considering high risk from drug use and possible medium from living alone and unemployment, I'd predict a YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which aligns with the age range in Example #3 where a similar age did not directly correlate with rearrest outcomes.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being Hispanic does not directly influence rearrest rates as seen in Examples #1 and #2, where other factors such as education and living situation were more impactful.\"),\n    (\"Number of Arrests\", \"low\", \"The individual has been arrested once but not convicted, similar to Example #2, which had no recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"The individual does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate, aligning with Example #2's no diploma and low risk.\"),\n    (\"Number of Jobs\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job during the year; this could be a moderate factor compared to being unemployed in Examples #2 and #3, which had no recidivism but different living situations.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month.

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 130 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
