    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old female and predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: She's 20 years old. Younger individuals are generally considered lower risk because they're still developing socially and economically. So that might be a low weight factor.\n\nRace: She identifies as White. From the examples, White individuals sometimes have higher recidivism rates, but it can vary based on other factors like education and employment. She has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college, which is positive\u2014higher education often correlates with better job opportunities and lower recidivism.\n\nMarital status: She's married and living with her spouse. Being in a stable relationship can provide support and reduce stress, which might lower her risk. So that could be low weight.\n\nEmployment history: She's held 3 jobs during the year and isn't enrolled in college. Having some job experience is positive; it shows she has skills and the ability to contribute, which usually reduces recidivism chances. That would likely have a medium or low weight.\n\nDrug use: She hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug-free status with no recent mental health issues points towards lower risk. So that's probably low weight.\n\nFamily background: She lived with both parents at age 2, in a household of size 4, urban area. A stable home environment is usually protective against recidivism, so this factor would have a low or medium weight.\n\nReligious belief: She believes God has something to do with her life. Religious involvement can provide support and accountability, which might positively influence her behavior. That could be considered low weight.\n\nPrior convictions: She's been arrested once but not convicted. A first-time offense might have some impact depending on the type of offense, but without a conviction, it's less severe than someone who has been convicted before.\n\n living situation: She's living with her spouse, so that's a stable environment which could reduce risk factors. That would be low weight.\n\nEducation level: She has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this is positive and likely medium weight.\n\nEmployment status: She's working but not in a higher education or professional field. Her job might offer stability, which is good for recidivism, so that could be low to medium weight.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive indicator of her mental well-being. That would have a low weight.\n\nPrevious offense type: Not applicable since she's not convicted but arrested once. If it was a violent crime versus property, that might influence differently, but the information isn't provided here. Maybe medium weight if unsure.\n\nOverall, considering all these factors, most are positive with some minor negatives like prior arrest and age. Combining these would predict a \"NO\" outcome with high confidence since her risk factors are mostly mitigating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Younger individuals (under 25) generally have lower recidivism rates due to their developing social and economic skills.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals may face higher recidivism rates compared to other racial groups, though this can vary based on education and employment.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living with a spouse in a stable relationship provides emotional support and reduces stress, which can lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Holding 3 jobs without being enrolled in college suggests some stability but may not directly correlate strongly with lower recidivism compared to others.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use and no depression indicate a positive mental health status, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in a household of 4 in an urban area provides support but may not inherently reduce risk compared to other factors like prior offense type or education.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Believing in God can provide moral support and accountability, which can positively influence behavior and recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"low\", \"A first-time offense (not convicted) may have a mitigating effect compared to prior convictions but this individual's case doesn't include such information.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with her spouse in a stable environment reduces stress and provides emotional support, which lowers recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma without college education may correlate with lower recidivism compared to others but still has some influence.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"low\", \"Working without being enrolled in higher education or professional fields may offer stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month indicates good mental health, which is a positive factor in reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Previous Offense Type\", \"medium\", \"Without conviction information, the type of offense may influence differently but typically non-violent offenses are less impactful than violent ones.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 3 inches and weighs between 125 and 149 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
