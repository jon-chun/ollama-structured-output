    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 19-year-old White male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a prior arrest of 1 time with a conviction. Prior convictions are a big red flag because they indicate past behavior that might lead to reoffending. So that's probably a high weight.\n\nHe's 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 170 lbs. Weight could be a factor in recidivism, but it's more about overall health or substance use than just his size. Since he hasn't used drugs recently except for marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, maybe that's not as concerning now.\n\nHe's living alone with no prior marriage, so no support system there. Being an only child might mean less supervision. He has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which could affect his motivation or ability to get involved in community programs.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs during the year; job stability is important. Having fewer jobs can sometimes correlate with more unstable situations leading to substance abuse issues.\n\nHe mentions not feeling depressed over the past month, so that might be a medium factor because lack of depression doesn't always predict future behavior unless it's linked to substance use or other factors.\n\nLiving in an urban area with his biological mother and household size 5 is interesting. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more stressors, which could contribute but maybe also access to resources. The household size might indicate more shared responsibility or less support for him individually.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life, so that's a positive factor. High belief in religion often correlates with better self-discipline and lower recidivism rates compared to those who don't have such beliefs.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest is high, job history is medium, living situation is mixed but maybe slightly negative due to urban environment and household size, lack of recent drug use except for marijuana/cocaine (medium), no depression (low or medium depending on context). High belief in God (high).\n\nSo the overall risk factors point towards a higher chance of rearrest. Maybe around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest with a conviction, which is a significant indicator of past behavior that may lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"job_tenure\", \"medium\", \"Held only 2 jobs during the year, which could indicate some job instability or limited experience, potentially correlating with higher risk factors like substance abuse and lack of support from family or community\"),\n    (\"family_living_environment\", \"low\", \"Lived in a household of size 5 with his biological mother in an urban area.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
