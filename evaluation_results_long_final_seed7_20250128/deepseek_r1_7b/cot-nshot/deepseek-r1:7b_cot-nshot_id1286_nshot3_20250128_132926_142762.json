    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 20-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a moderate risk because being arrested even if you don't get a conviction can sometimes lead to more scrutiny or community impact, which might affect his chances of reoffending.\n\nHe weighs 215 lbs at 5'6\", which is on the higher side. I'm not sure how weight affects recidivism directly, but maybe it's just a number here without any other context. So I'll assign this as low risk since there's no information suggesting otherwise.\n\nNever been married and living alone\u2014so he doesn't have a support network at home. That could be a medium risk because being an only child or living alone might mean fewer resources for emotional support, which can sometimes contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now. Education is generally protective against recidivism, so this should lower the risk. High school diploma or GED is usually seen as positive for reducing future criminal behavior.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year\u2014lack of income and skills might increase the likelihood of re-entering the criminal system. So this could be a medium-high risk factor because being unemployed can lead to substance abuse, lack of motivation, etc.\n\nNo drug use in past four years and hasn't felt depressed in a month. That's actually protective; not using drugs and feeling stable mentally are good indicators for lower recidivism. So maybe a low weight here.\n\nAt young age, lived with biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates or more substance abuse issues, which could be a medium risk factor because living in such environments might expose him to negative influences.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life\u2014so he's religious. Religious beliefs can provide moral support and structure, which are protective against recidivism. So this should have a low weight here.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium (arrest), Low (weight), Medium (living alone), High (unemployed despite school), Low (no drugs/depression), Medium (urban living), Low (religious). \n\nI think the overall risk is on the higher side because of the unemployment and lack of convictions, but other factors like being religious and having no prior convictions might balance it out. Maybe a medium-high confidence\u2014let's say 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest, which may indicate some exposure to the criminal system that could potentially lead to recidivism but does not necessarily confirm it.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"The individual's weight is moderate and does not inherently suggest a higher risk of recidivism without additional context about health or living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can reduce social support, which might increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors but does not guarantee it.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"high\", \"The individual has no job experience during the past year, which could contribute to increased substance abuse and lack of motivation for positive behavior.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"The individual has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a strong indicator of lower recidivism risk as drug use is often linked to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation at Age of Enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area of household size 2 could expose the individual to environmental factors that might influence behavior but does not directly correlate with high risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"low\", \"The individual believes God has something to do with their life, which can provide moral support and reduce recidivism risk through structured living and positive influences.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 215 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 2, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
