    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case for a 18-year-old White male. Let me go through each of the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18, which might indicate he's still developing, but since he's already been convicted once, that's a significant factor. Being in school could mean he's focusing on education, which usually helps reduce recidivism.\n\nHe's not married and living alone, so no support system to fall back on. That's concerning because having a support network can help with personal issues when released.\n\nHe has no jobs, so economic instability is at play here. Without income, he might face unemployment or other challenges that could lead him down another path.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no depression over the month adds positive factors. It shows discipline and mental stability, which are good indicators for recidivism.\n\nLiving with both parents in a household of four in an urban area means he's surrounded by family support. Urban environments often have better resources and services that could aid his transition post-arrest.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal issues is a bit concerning because lack of spiritual support can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, but it might also indicate he's proactive about managing his issues.\n\nNow, putting this all together. He was convicted once, which is worse than not being convicted in the examples where outcomes were NO. His living situation and lack of jobs are negative factors. The positive aspects like education and no drug use are mitigating, but I think the conviction and lack of support might tip it towards a higher risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"NO\" because he's committed to school and hasn't used drugs or experienced depression recently. However, having been convicted once is still concerning. Maybe I should give him a medium confidence since there are mixed factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"conviction history\", \"high\", \"He has been convicted once, which significantly increases the likelihood of recidivism compared to those who have not been convicted at all.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of size 4 indicates strong family support, which can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"job status\", \"high\", \"Not holding any jobs during the year puts him at risk of economic instability and potential reoffending factors like lack of income support.\"), \n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years suggests he is maintaining a clean lifestyle, which can positively influence recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month indicates good mental health, further reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"support network\", \"high\", \"Living alone without family support increases vulnerability to negative influences and potential reoffending factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
