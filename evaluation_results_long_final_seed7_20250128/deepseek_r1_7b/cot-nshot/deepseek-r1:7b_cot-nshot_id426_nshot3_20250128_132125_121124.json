    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out this risk assessment case. So, the person is a 20-year-old White female who was arrested once but not convicted. She weighs 120 lbs and is married living alone. No high school diploma or GED, not in college. She's held one job, used drugs (marijuana and cocaine), hasn't felt depressed recently. Her young age she lived with her biological mother in a household of five in an urban area, and she doesn't believe in God affecting her.\n\nLooking at the examples provided:\n\nExample 1: A Hispanic male with low recidivism. Factors like being married living with spouse, high school diploma, not using drugs, stable job history (4 jobs) might contribute to lower risk. But here, this person is female, White, has fewer jobs, higher drug use.\n\nExample 2: Black male, not convicted but arrested once. Not married, alone, no HS diploma, low job history, no drug use. Outcome was NO.\n\nExample 3: White male with a history of arrests (3 times), used both marijuana and cocaine, felt very depressed, from smaller household in rural area, didn't believe in God. Outcome was YES.\n\nSo for this case:\n\nAge: 20 \u2013 young, possibly more susceptible.\nMarital status: Married living alone \u2013 maybe indicating some stress or separation issues.\nEducation: No diploma/GED \u2013 less stable environment.\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine \u2013 significant drug issues could impair judgment or lead to substance abuse problems.\nJob history: Held one job \u2013 not much employment stability.\nHousehold size at young age: 5 \u2013 maybe more stress from living with relatives.\nNo religious belief \u2013 perhaps less support system.\n\nComparing to the examples, this person has some overlapping factors but also new ones. The key factors that predict recidivism are past arrests (even if not convicted), drug use, and perhaps lack of education or stable job history.\n\nIn Example 3, a similar drug use pattern led to YES, while in others without such issues, it was NO. So with her drug use and other factors, she might be more likely to recidminate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Her age of 20 may indicate higher susceptibility to substance abuse and reoffending in the short term.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"She is married but living alone, which may suggest internal stress or separation issues that could influence behavior.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED indicates less educational stability and potential exposure to systemic issues.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is a significant risk factor for substance abuse and potentially impulsive behavior leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"job_history\", \"low\", \"Held only one job during the year, which may indicate unstable employment or lack of skills for future gainful employment.\"),\n    (\"household_size_at_young_age\", \"medium\", \"Lived with her biological mother in a household of five at a young age, which could contribute to underlying stress factors.\"),\n    (\"religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Does not believe that God is involved in her personal life, which may reduce religious support and community ties that prevent reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She is married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
