    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, I'm supposed to analyze a risk assessment case based on some examples provided earlier. The user has given three examples with different factors leading to either YES or NO outcomes. Now, there's another case to assess, so I'll need to go through each factor and determine its weight.\n\nFirst, let me look at the new case:\n\n- 21-year-old White male.\n- Arrested once, not convicted.\n- 6 feet 5 inches, over 250 lbs. That's quite heavy.\n- Living alone with no spouse or partner.\n- High school diploma, not in college.\n- Worked two jobs in the past year.\n- Drug use: marijuana in past four years but no depression in the last month.\n- Youngest, lived with both parents in a household of seven in an urban area.\n- Believes God has something to do with his life.\n\nNow, comparing this to the examples:\n\nIn Example #1 and #2, being Hispanic or Black didn't directly affect the outcome, but being White did. However, the main differences were in prior convictions, job status, living situation, etc.\n\nLooking at each factor:\n\nAge: 21 is similar to Examples 1 and 2, but he's White now. In Example #3, a 19-year-old White had more factors contributing to YES.\n\nPrior Arrests: He was arrested once but not convicted. Both Examples 1-3 have varying prior arrest counts (1, 0, 3). The absence of a conviction might lower the risk, similar to Example 2.\n\nBMI: Over 250 lbs is quite high. In Example #3, someone with past drug use and being White had higher risk. BMI could be an indicator of health issues affecting recidivism.\n\nLiving Alone vs Shared: He's living alone, which was a factor in Example 1 (married) but not mentioned as bad here. Living alone might increase risk if other factors are present.\n\nEducation: High school diploma but not college. In Example #3, someone with a high school diploma had higher risk. Maybe education level is a factor for recidivism.\n\nJob Status: He has two jobs, which was in Example 3 where he held four and used drugs more heavily. More stable income might lower risk compared to Example 3.\n\nDrugs: He used marijuana but not recent depression. In Example #1, no drug use led to NO. Drug use can increase risk if it's frequent or severe.\n\nHousehold Size at Age: Youngest with both parents (household size 7) in urban area vs Example 3 where he was White and lived with two parents in a household of 3. Urban areas might have different factors, but the high household size could indicate family support or stress, which isn't clear.\n\nBelief in God: He believes God is involved. In Example #3, non-religious belief led to YES. Believing in God might provide some stability, reducing risk.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Prior Arrests (1): Medium.\n- BMI High: High, as being over 250 lbs could be a sign of health issues that affect job or living conditions.\n- Single and Living Alone: Low? Because he's not married but is in the same situation. Maybe medium if other factors are present.\n- Education (Diploma): Medium, because having some education might lead to better opportunities.\n- Drug Use (Marijuana): Low since it's infrequent and no recent depression.\n- Single Parent Household: High? Urban vs rural household size 7 could have different implications. Maybe medium if not as stable as being with two parents.\n\nWait, in Example #3, higher factors led to YES. So maybe factors like high BMI, more drug use, or living situation can tip the balance.\n\nSo risk factors:\n\n1. Prior Arrests: Medium (1 arrest).\n2. BMI High: High.\n3. Drug Use: Low.\n4. Single and Alone: Maybe medium if no spouse but not married.\n5. Education: Medium.\n6. PriorConvictionsHigh: No, he's not convicted.\n7. Belief in God: Maybe low or medium.\n\nCombining these, the higher risk factors are BMI High (high), Prior Arrests (medium). The lower ones might balance it out.\n\nSo overall prediction: YES with high confidence since BMI and prior arrests could be significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"Medium\", \"The person has been arrested once, which moderately contributes to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"BMI High\", \"High\", \"Overweight significantly increases the likelihood of health issues affecting job stability and living conditions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"Low\", \"Limited use of marijuana with no recent depression does not strongly indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"Medium\", \"Living alone, while not married, could moderate but still contributes to recidivism risk if other factors are present.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"Medium\", \"Having a high school diploma without college enrollment may offer some stability but is not a strong protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 5 inches and weighs over 250 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
