    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case using the given examples and then predict the rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at the provided examples to understand how each factor contributes to recidivism outcomes. In Example 1, a Hispanic male with several factors like past convictions, living situation, education, etc., had an outcome of NO. Similarly, Example 2 is another Black male without prior convictions but also had an outcome of NO. However, in Example 3, despite being White and having some negative factors like drug use and low mood, the outcome was YES.\n\nNow, applying this to the new case:\n\nThe person is a 20-year-old female identified as White. She has been arrested 10 times and convicted. Her height is 5'6\", weight 115 lbs. Married living with spouse. No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Held 1 job last year. Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) and recent severe mood swings.\n\nI need to assign a relative weight to each risk factor:\n\n1. **Number of prior arrests and convictions**: High (10+ arrests, convicted)\n2. **Ethnicity**: White is neutral compared to examples but in Example 3, White had a positive outcome despite other factors.\n3. **Age**: 20 is early adulthood; not sure how that affects recidivism rate yet.\n4. **Gender**: Female might have different outcomes due to societal roles or support systems.\n5. **Marital status and living situation**: Living with spouse suggests stability, which could be a protective factor (low risk).\n6. **Education level**: No HS diploma/GED; low education is linked to higher recidivism (high risk).\n7. **Employment history**: Held 1 job last year; not much work history, so might indicate less stable employment (medium).\n8. **Drug use**: Past four years of marijuana and cocaine use; high risk for relapse.\n9. **Mood swings**: Some severe mood issues recently, which can affect motivation and relationships; medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The person has a high number of prior arrests, low education, recent drug use, but living with a spouse. Her gender might play a role in lower recidivism compared to the examples given because she's White but not necessarily in an environment like Example 3 where White had a positive outcome.\n\nConsidering all factors, her risk is high due to prior convictions and drug use, despite being married. The presence of mood issues could exacerbate substance use problems and stress, increasing the chance of rearrest. However, living with a spouse might offer some support, mitigating some risk factors.\n\nI think combining these, she's likely to have a YES outcome for 3-year rearrest recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested 10 times and convicted, which is a significant factor in recidivism risk as indicated by the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 20 years old, she is at an early stage of adulthood, suggesting potentially greater life stability compared to younger individuals who may face higher risk factors.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"neutral\", \"Being female does not inherently increase or decrease recidivism risk; however, societal roles and support systems could influence outcomes but are not explicitly highlighted here.\"),\n    (\"living_with_spouse\", \"low\", \"Living with her spouse provides a sense of stability and support, which can act as a protective factor against recidivism as seen in Example 2 where similar living arrangements led to a NO outcome.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED significantly increases the risk of reoffending compared to individuals with higher education levels, as shown in Examples 1 and 3 where lower education was associated with lower outcomes but this individual's case is different.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held only 1 job last year, which may indicate limited economic stability or opportunities that could lead to substance use issues affecting employment prospects over time.\"),\n    (\"drugs_past\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years; substance abuse is a known precursor to recidivism and can lead to further legal issues if relapsed.\"),\n    (\"mood_swings\", \"medium\", \"Experienced severe mood swings recently, which could impact decision-making and relationships, potentially exacerbating existing risk factors such as drug use and living in an environment with high stress triggers.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"neutral\", \"White ethnicity is neutral here; however, in Example 3, White individuals had a higher outcome despite similar risk factors.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 115 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse.
