    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history: two arrests and one conviction. That's high risk because prior convictions are strong indicators of reoffending.\n\nHis height is tall at 6 feet 8 inches. I'm not sure how that affects recidivism, but maybe taller doesn't necessarily correlate with higher risk here.\n\nHe's living alone, which might indicate a lack of support system, contributing to medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED means he's less likely to get employed in the future, adding medium risk.\n\nNot working at all during the year is another point towards medium risk since job instability can lead to substance use and other issues.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) once a year isn't severe but could be a risk factor if it leads to other substance abuse problems.\n\nHe feels no depression in the past month, which might suggest better mental health than some recidivistic individuals, so maybe lower risk from that angle.\n\nGrowing up in a household of six with his mother at an early age\u2014large family can provide stability but also sometimes more strain, possibly medium risk.\n\nConsidering God has something to do with his life\u2014he seems to have a positive outlook, which might mitigate some negative risk factors towards high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior convictions are the highest risk. Other factors like living alone and limited education contribute moderately. Drug use is low but not significant here. His positive outlook somewhat reduces risk. So overall, I'm leaning towards NO with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has two arrests and one conviction, which significantly increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support system, which can contribute to higher risk but not exclusively high risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED certificate indicates lower educational attainment, which is associated with higher recidivism rates but in this case, the individual has held no jobs during the year, further supporting low risk from this factor.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Only marijuana use in the past four years does not indicate severe drug dependency and he has felt no depression over the past month, which suggests better mental health than some recidivistic individuals.\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of 15\", \"medium\", \"Living with six family members may have created more strain or stress but also provided stability in previous years, contributing to medium risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Positive Outlook on God\", \"high\", \"Considering that God has something to do with his life suggests a positive outlook and higher self-esteem, which can somewhat mitigate the risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 8 inches and weighs 161 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
