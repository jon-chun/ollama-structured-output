    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. I'm a bit new to recidivism risk assessment, but I'll try my best. So, the person is a 22-year-old White female who was arrested once but not convicted. She weighs between 150 and 174 lbs, which isn't too bad. She's separated and living alone\u2014maybe that's a red flag because she might be more vulnerable.\n\nShe has no high school diploma or GED, so she's in a position where education could play a role. Not being enrolled in college reinforces that idea. She's only held two jobs in the past year; job instability can lead to unstable living situations and higher risk of recidivism.\n\nHer substance use is an issue\u2014she's been using cocaine and feels really down most of the month. That affects her mental state, which could influence her behavior. Living with her biological mother in a household of three in an urban area might have different dynamics compared to other examples. Urban environments can sometimes correlate with higher crime rates or unstable family situations.\n\nConsidering all these factors: low education level, instability in employment and living situation, substance use issues, and family background. These are all significant risk factors that contribute to recidivism. I think her chances of reoffending within three years are pretty high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is relatively young and may indicate a higher risk of re-offending as she gains experience and maturity.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"medium\", \"She does not have a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which could limit her ability to secure stable employment and make informed decisions.\"),\n    (\"Employment Stability\", \"low\", \"She has held only two jobs during the past year, indicating possible job instability that may lead to financial stress and increased risk of involvement in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"She is separated and living alone, which may contribute to feelings of loneliness and isolation, potentially leading to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"Substance Use\", \"high\", \"She has used cocaine in the past four years and feels extremely down most of the month, which can impair judgment, mental health, and ability to form positive relationships, all of which increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with her biological mother in a household of three, especially in an urban area, may have specific family dynamics that could influence her behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Her recent feelings of extreme depression and low mood can impair her ability to make rational decisions and may increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities to cope with stress or anxiety.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She is separated and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
