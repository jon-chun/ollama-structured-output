First, I'll list out all the risk factors from the given information and then assign each a low, medium, or high weight based on their relevance to recidivism.\n\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested once and convicted. At 5 feet 11 inches and weighing between 175-199 lbs, he's of a certain size which might not directly correlate with risk but could be related to other factors.\n\nHe's never married and isn't living alone, which is interesting because sometimes living arrangements can influence behavior, though in this case, it seems stable. He has a GED and isn't enrolled in college, which might indicate some educational barriers that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year, which shows some work experience but also implies he might have struggled with employment before, possibly affecting his motivation or stability.\n\nDrug use history includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential relapse and could increase future offenses or difficulties in maintaining stable behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, so no depression symptoms reported recently, which is positive but might change if there's a recent life event causing stress.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Living with multiple family members can sometimes provide emotional support and stability, reducing risk factors here.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has any role in his personal events, which might indicate a different world-view that could influence his behavior or decision-making.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: he's 18, which is still young, but has prior convictions. His arrest history shows some criminal tendencies. Drug use and educational barriers are significant red flags. Living with multiple family members in an urban setting might offer support, but the lack of religious belief could be a factor depending on other personal aspects.\n\nHis job history isn't great either; holding two jobs during the year suggests he worked to support himself, which is positive, but maybe it's inconsistent or difficult. Not being married and not living alone might indicate some instability, though he's in an urban area with his mother, so perhaps that's a stabilizing factor.\n\nThe lack of recent depression is also a plus. So while there are clear risk factors like prior arrest, drug use, and educational issues, the positive aspects like family support and job history might temper the risk slightly.\n\nGiven all this, I think he has a moderate to low risk. The key points are his prior criminal history and substance abuse, which are strong indicators of recidivism despite some mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a prior arrest history, indicating potential for repeat offenses and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse can significantly predict future recidivism due to potential relapse or impaired judgment.\"),\n    (\"Educational Barrier\", \"medium\", \"Having only a GED may present challenges in accessing further education or employment opportunities, potentially affecting stability and motivation.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs during the year suggests some level of work experience, though it may indicate inconsistent or limited job security which could be a risk factor for dropping out or experiencing job instability leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Family Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of six provides emotional support and stability, reducing potential stressors that could lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health Indicators\", \"low\", \"The individual has not reported recent depression over the past month, indicating current mental health stability, though this should be monitored for changes that might increase risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Not believing in God may influence decision-making and could potentially affect behavior related to substance use or seeking help, which are factors that could either mitigate or exacerbate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Age and Stability\", \"low\", \"At 18 years old with no recent family issues reported, this indicates a period of relative stability that could positively correlate with reduced risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
