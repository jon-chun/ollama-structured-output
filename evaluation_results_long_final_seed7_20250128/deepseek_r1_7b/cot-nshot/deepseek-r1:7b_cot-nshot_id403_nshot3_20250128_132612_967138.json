    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this risk assessment case using the provided examples. Let me start by looking at the three examples given.\n\nIn Example #1, a Hispanic male with one prior arrest was predicted to have a NO rearrest outcome. His factors include being married, no drugs use, and living with his spouse in a household of seven. These positives likely contributed to not reoffending.\n\nExample #2 is similar but for a Black male who hasn't been convicted. He's single, doesn't drink or drug test positive, which might reduce the risk. His factors include living alone and no prior convictions, so again, predicting NO.\n\nIn Example #3, despite some prior arrests and drug use, this White male was predicted to have a YES outcome. The factors there like living with both parents in a rural area and feeling down could increase the risk.\n\nNow looking at the case we need to predict:\n\n22-year-old Black male arrested twice, convicted, 6'1\", 180 lbs. He's not living alone but is in an urban setting. His drug use history of marijuana and lack of depression this month are noted. Past living situation was with his mother in a household of five.\n\nI'll break down each risk factor step by step:\n\nAge: 22, which is considered low risk for recidivism as it's early adulthood.\nPrevious Arrests: 2 convictions\u2014higher risk but perhaps mitigated if he's taken steps to reform.\nEthnicity: Black might have different recidivism rates compared to Hispanic or White, so maybe medium risk factor.\nDrug Use: Past use of marijuana (medium) and current no depression\u2014but past use could still be a risk.\nLiving Situation: Not alone in an urban area\u2014might indicate social support but also higher stressors. Previous living with mother adds context.\nMarital Status: Never married\u2014he might not have the same emotional bonds as others, possibly medium.\nHousehold Size at Age of Arrest: Household of 5 at age ~19 now living in urban settings\u2014could be a risk factor due to instability or exposure.\n\nPutting it all together, while he has some mitigating factors like no current depression and being in an urban area, the past arrests and drug use history could weigh him towards a YES outcome. The examples suggest that prior convictions increase the likelihood of recidivism compared to others with fewer offenses.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which is typically associated with lower risk of recidivism as they are in early adulthood and more likely to focus on personal development rather than criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Previous Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests and one conviction increase the likelihood of recidivism.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 22-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone.

He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
