    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me start by looking at each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male of White ethnicity. He's been arrested once but not convicted, which could be a positive sign as a first-time offense might indicate lower intent to repeat. His weight is between 200 and 224 lbs, so he's overweight; maybe that's a negative factor related to health issues possibly leading to more crimes.\n\nHe's living alone with no spouse or partner, which might mean less support system for him, potentially increasing his risk of engaging in criminal activities. He's enrolled in school, which is an indicator of desistance from crime and stability\u2014so this should be weighted low.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs during the year; having a stable job usually reduces the likelihood of recidivism because he has a reason to stay out of trouble. No drug use for the past four years is definitely a good sign, showing he's been clean which can prevent future offenses.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month suggests he's mentally stable and less likely to be motivated by negative emotions towards crime. Living with his biological mother in a household of five might mean more supervision or emotional support from family, so that could lower the risk. Lastly, he believes in God, which is often associated with forgiveness and moral accountability, reducing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: no prior convictions, clean record, stable job, enrollment in school\u2014all positive signs. The negative factors like being overweight and living alone are somewhat mitigated by other strong positive indicators. Therefore, I'd predict a low risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior Convictions\", \"low\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, indicating no prior convictions which is a mitigating factor.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"medium\", \"He weighs between 200 and 224 lbs, which may be associated with health issues that could potentially lead to increased criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases the risk of engaging in criminal activities as there is no support system for guidance and deterrence\"),\n    (\"Enrolled in School\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school suggests a desire for education and stability, reducing the likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"Jobs Held\", \"low\", \"He has held 3 jobs during the year, indicating stable employment which can provide motivation to stay out of trouble\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"No drugs used in the past four years shows a clean record which is protective against future offenses\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests mental stability and lower likelihood of being motivated towards criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age of Living\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological mother in a household of five may provide some level of supervision but doesn't completely eliminate the risk\"),\n    (\"Belief in God\", \"low\", \"Considering that God has something to do with what happens to him personally indicates a sense of moral accountability which reduces risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
