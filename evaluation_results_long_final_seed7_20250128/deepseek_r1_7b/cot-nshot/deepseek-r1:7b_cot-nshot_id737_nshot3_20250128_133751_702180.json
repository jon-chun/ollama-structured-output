    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this query from a user who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided three example cases with specific risk factors and outcomes, then another case to analyze. My task is to assign weights to each factor in the new case and predict the outcome.\n\nFirst, let's break down what they're asking for. The user has given examples where different risk factors correlate with either a YES or NO outcome regarding 3-year rearrest recidivism. Now, there's a specific case they want me to analyze: a 19-year-old White male with multiple arrests, living alone, without a job, no drug use but some mood issues, and a past residence history.\n\nI need to assign each of these factors a weight\u2014low, medium, or high\u2014and then use that to predict the outcome. The examples might help me gauge which factors are more influential in predicting recidivism.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 1, despite multiple factors like being Hispanic, living with family, and some drug use, the outcome was NO rearrest. Similarly, Example 2 had a Black male with fewer risk factors, also resulting in NO. The key difference is that in Example 3, more serious drug use, higher number of arrests (though not convicted), and living alone led to YES.\n\nSo, high number of prior arrests without convictions seems like a strong indicator of recidivism. That factor might have a high weight because it's a clear sign of problematic behavior leading to reoffending.\n\nAge is another factor; being 19 in Examples 2 and 3 resulted in NO outcomes, while higher age with more offenses (as in Example 3) could influence that differently. But here, the person is still quite young but has multiple prior arrests.\n\nLiving situation: living alone vs. with family. In Example 2, living alone had a better outcome than being with family in Examples 1 and 3. Living alone might indicate less support and more risk, so maybe this factor should have a medium weight since it's somewhat of an issue but not the most significant.\n\nEducation level: high school diploma without college enrollment is better than not having any education, as seen in Example 2 where no HS diploma had NO rearrest. So education could be a medium to low weight here.\n\nNo job experience might suggest instability, which can increase risk. Since he's never been employed and doesn't have a diploma, this factor should probably have a high weight because unemployment is linked to higher recidivism rates.\n\nDrug use: in Example 3, multiple drug uses (marijuana and cocaine) led to YES. Here, the user hasn't used any drugs but mentions mood issues. Mood issues could be related to mental health, which might influence recidivism indirectly by affecting behavior. So, this factor should have a medium weight.\n\nReligious belief: God has something to do with his life\u2014this might relate to personal motivation or lack thereof, potentially reducing risk if he's motivated, but it's less direct than other factors. Maybe low weight here since it's more about personal belief rather than direct behavioral indicators.\n\nHousehold size and past residence history are in Examples 1-3 as well, but I don't think those apply directly to this case except for the urban vs rural setting, which might affect support networks but isn't a primary risk factor. So these could be low weight factors.\n\nPutting it all together: high prior arrests (high), age and other factors that aren't as bad but still have some impact (medium), living alone (medium), no job (high), drug use (none here, so maybe medium if any issues), and others at low. The overall risk seems pretty high because of the multiple past arrests without convictions and lack of job, which could indicate behavioral instability.\n\nSo the prediction would be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of prior arrests\", \"high\", \"This individual has been arrested 9 times but has not been convicted.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 9 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 3 inches. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college.

At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
