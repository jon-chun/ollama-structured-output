    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case using the examples provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at Example #3, which had a White male with 3 prior arrests but not convicted, some drug use, and feeling quite down. He ended up with a YES outcome. Now, in our current case, he has only one arrest, no convictions, less severe factors like drug use is non-existent here, no negative feelings reported, and different living situation.\n\nThe risk factors for this new person are: age 20, White, 1 prior arrest (not convicted), height 5'9\", weight 156 lbs, single living, HS diploma not enrolled, held 2 jobs, no drug use in past four years, lived with biological dad in a household of 4, and believes God has nothing to do with his life.\n\nComparing to the examples, Example #3 had multiple prior arrests which increased recidivism. Here, only one arrest but no conviction, so that's lower risk. The person is White, similar to Example #3 but without the same high number of past arrests or drug use issues. His living situation is single, which might be protective compared to living with a larger household.\n\nHe hasn't experienced negative emotions like feeling down, unlike Example #3 who did feel so depressed. His education and job history are good too\u2014HS diploma not enrolled but held 2 jobs. So he's stable in employment and doesn't have drug issues to contribute to instability.\n\nHis prior arrests were for one offense, but if it was a minor offense or non-violent, that might make the recidivism lower than someone with multiple violent crimes. His household size at a young age is smaller (4 people) compared to Example #3's 7, which could indicate more support and less isolation, contributing to better outcomes.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think his risk of rearrest in three years is low because he has fewer prior offenses, no drug use, stable living situation, positive emotional state, and a clean record. So, the prediction should be NO with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"The person has been arrested once but not convicted, which is less impactful compared to those with multiple arrests as seen in Example #3.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Being White and similar to the White male in Example #3, this factor does not significantly increase recidivism risk in this case.\"),\n    (\"physical health\", \"low\", \"The person's weight (156 lbs) is within a normal range compared to the Black male in Example #2 who weighed 135 lbs.

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 156 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size 4. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
