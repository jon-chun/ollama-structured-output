    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism outcome for this new case using the examples provided. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll list out all the risk factors mentioned in the case:\n\n- Age: 20 years old\n- Race: Black\n- Arrests: 2 times, not convicted\n- Height: 5'1\"\n- Weight: 130 lbs\n- Marital status: Never married, living alone\n- Education: High school diploma, not enrolled in college\n- Employment: No jobs held in the past year\n- Drug use: Past four years, used cocaine; no depression felt in the last month\n- Childhood household: Lived with biological mother in a household of 4 at a young age\n- God involvement: Believes God has something to do with her life\n\nNow, I'll compare these factors against the examples given. \n\nLooking at Example #1 and #2, both had Black individuals without convictions but resulted in NO recidivism. However, in Example #3, despite being arrested 3 times (not convicted), a White individual also had high recidivism.\n\nThe key difference here is that while the current case has more arrests than Example #3, it's not been convicted. In Examples 1 and 2, despite being arrested once or twice without convictions, they didn't rearrest. But in the new case, she was arrested twice but not convicted, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHer drug use is only cocaine, unlike the previous examples where there was no drug use. So that's different.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone, similar to the examples. Her education level matches too. She held no jobs, same as the others. \n\nHer household size at a young age was 4 in an urban area compared to Example #3's rural household of 3. Also, she believes God is involved with her life, which might be protective.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while there are some similarities and differences from the examples, her arrest count (2 times) without conviction seems like it could increase recidivism risk slightly. But since she's Black, similar to Examples 1 and 2, maybe not as high as someone with a prior conviction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"The person is 20 years old, which places her in a vulnerable stage where risk behaviors might reoccur within the next three years.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"low\", \"Being Black may be associated with lower recidivism rates compared to other racial groups, as seen in Examples #1 and #2.\"),\n    (\"Arrests\", \"high\", \"Two arrests without prior convictions could indicate higher risk of reoffending compared to individuals with no arrests but similar risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Height\", \"low\", \"Her height (5'1\") is not directly associated with recidivism risk in the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"She weighs 130 lbs, which is within a healthy range and does not indicate any physical risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"low\", \"Living alone without a spouse may reduce social support, which could be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma matches the educational level of similar cases in Examples #1 and #2, indicating no increased risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"low\", \"Holding no jobs during the past year suggests stable living conditions, which are associated with lower recidivism risks.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Her recent use of cocaine (past four years) indicates potential substance abuse issues that could contribute to reoffending but is mitigated by her lack of recent depression feelings in the last month.\"),\n    (\"Childhood Household Size\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of 4 might provide some protective factors compared to smaller households, especially in urban areas.\"),\n    (\"God's Role\", \"high\", \"Believing that God has something to do with her life could be a significant protective factor against recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as Black. She has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
