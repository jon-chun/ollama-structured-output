    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk assessment case. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Hispanic male with 3 arrests but no convictions. That's a high arrest count which might indicate prior problematic behavior.\n\nHis weight and height don't seem directly relevant here, unless there's an association with health issues, but it's not specified.\n\nHe's living alone without a spouse, so no family support which could contribute to higher risk.\n\nNot enrolled in school means he's not gaining educational skills which are usually protective against recidivism.\n\nNo job experience during the year suggests lack of steady income and potential substance use.\n\nPositive mental health with no drug use but feelings of depression adds complexity. If he's dealing with mood issues, that could either be a risk or protective factor depending on context.\n\nLiving with both parents in a household of 7 in an urban area might offer more support than in smaller households, which could lower risk.\n\nConsidering God has no role in his life indicates a lack of religious or spiritual support, possibly affecting motivation and self-worth.\n\nNow, weighting each factor: high for arrests, medium for living situation and family presence, low for education and job status. The mental health aspect is neutral as it's mixed.\n\nPutting it all together, the higher number of arrests (3) without a conviction points towards a risk of reoffending.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested three times, which indicates prior problematic behavior that could influence future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse may reduce family support, potentially increasing risk factors for recidivism.\"), \n    (\"Education Status\", \"low\", \"Not enrolled in school might mean he hasn't sought educational opportunities to improve his situation or moral standing.\"), \n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Holding no jobs during the year suggests lack of income and stability, which could contribute to substance use and other risky behaviors.\"), \n    (\"Mental Health\", \"neutral\", \"Not using drugs but feeling down may indicate personal challenges that could affect decision-making or willingness to reintegrate into society.\"),\n    (\"Family Environment\", \"medium\", \"Living with both parents in a household of seven suggests some level of family support, which might offset risk factors slightly.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is an 18-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 198 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
