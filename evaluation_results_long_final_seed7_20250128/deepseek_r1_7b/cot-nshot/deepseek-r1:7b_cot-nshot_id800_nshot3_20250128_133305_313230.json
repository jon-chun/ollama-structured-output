    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to analyze the risk factors for this 19-year-old White female and predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: She's 19, which is quite young. Young adults are more likely to reoffend because they're still developing their decision-making skills. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nNumber of prior arrests and convictions: She has been arrested once and convicted. That's significant because having a criminal history increases the likelihood of future offenses. High risk here too.\n\nMarital status: She's married living with her spouse. Stable relationships often correlate with lower recidivism rates, so this might be a medium factor in this case.\n\nEducation level: She has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Some studies suggest that education can reduce recidivism by helping individuals make better choices later on. So maybe low to medium risk here.\n\nOccupation: She's held only one job during the year. Employment stability is linked with lower recidivism, so this could be a medium factor against her.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use itself can lead to more impulsive behavior, which might increase rearrest risk\u2014so high risk here.\n\nFamily background: At a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of five in an urban area. Larger households sometimes have different dynamics that could potentially influence her behavior. However, living with supportive family is usually positive, but being part of a larger household without clear support might be a medium risk factor.\n\nGod involvement: She believes God has something to do with her life. Religious beliefs can provide guidance and reduce risky behaviors, so this is likely a low to medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The high prior arrest and age at 19 are strong red flags. Her drug use adds to the risk of impulsive decisions. Her single job might not be enough for responsible behavior. Despite her stable living situation, she's young and has a criminal history which points towards a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 19 years old, a young adult who may still be developing decision-making skills and is more likely to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested once and convicted, indicating a criminal history that may predict future offenses.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"She is married and living with her spouse, which could suggest stability but may not directly correlate with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college, which can be associated with better decision-making and reduced risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Occupation\", \"medium\", \"She has held only one job during the year, which may indicate limited opportunities for stable employment and consistent behavior patterns.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"She has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which can lead to impulsive behaviors and increased likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Living with both biological parents in a household of five in an urban area may have potential influences on behavior but does not directly indicate high risk without additional context about support systems.\"),\n    (\"God Involvement\", \"low\", \"She believes that God has something to do with her life, which can provide guidance and reduce risky behaviors, indicating a lower risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

    "user": "You are a criminal risk assessment expert. First,analyze the following example cases of risk factors and resulting 3 year rearrest recidivism outcome:\n\nExample #1:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as Hispanic. He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 190 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 7. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #2:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 135 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: NO\n\nExample #3:\nRisk Factors: The person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 165 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 4 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3, in a rural area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\nOutcome: YES\n\n\nNext, step back and take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 145 lbs. She is married and is currently living with her spouse. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nBased on the above n-shot examples and your weighted risk factor analysis for this particular case, predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case.\nRespond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
