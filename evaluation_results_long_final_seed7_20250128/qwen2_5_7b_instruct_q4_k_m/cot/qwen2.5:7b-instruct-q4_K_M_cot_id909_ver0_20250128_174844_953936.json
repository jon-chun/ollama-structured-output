He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 158 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
