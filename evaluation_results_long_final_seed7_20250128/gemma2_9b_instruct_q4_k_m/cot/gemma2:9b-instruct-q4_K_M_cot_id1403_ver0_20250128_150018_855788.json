These are demographic factors generally associated with lower recidivism.\n* **Medium Risk Factors:** Race (acknowledging systemic disparities), Prior Arrests/Convictions, Marital Status, Childhood Environment. These factors suggest some increased risk but not as strongly as others.\n* **High Risk Factors:** Education, Employment, Drug Use, Mental Health. These are powerful predictors of recidivism due to their direct link to criminal behavior and vulnerability.\n\n\n\n**Prediction and Confidence:**\n\nThe prediction is \"YES\" because the higher-weighted risk factors outweigh the lower-weighted ones. \n\nThe confidence level is 65% because while several high-risk factors are present, there are also mitigating factors (like age) that contribute to a less certain prediction.",
