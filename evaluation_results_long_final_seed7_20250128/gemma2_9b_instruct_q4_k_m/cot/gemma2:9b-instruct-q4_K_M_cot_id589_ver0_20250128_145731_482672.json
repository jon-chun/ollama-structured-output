Remember, risk assessments are complex and should be conducted by trained professionals with access to more comprehensive data. \n\n* **High Risk Factors:** Drug use is a major driver of this prediction. Prior convictions also contribute significantly.\n* **Medium Risk Factors:** Employment history and education level fall into this category. There's some indication of potential risk, but not as strong as the high-risk factors.\n* **Low Risk Factors:** Age, race/ethnicity, physical attributes, living situation, and marital status are generally not considered strong predictors of recidivism in this case. \n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This is a simplified example. Real-world risk assessments involve many more factors and sophisticated statistical models.\n*  The confidence level (65%) reflects the uncertainty inherent in any prediction. There's always a chance the individual may or may not reoffend.\n\n\n\nLet me know if you have any other scenarios you'd like to explore!",
