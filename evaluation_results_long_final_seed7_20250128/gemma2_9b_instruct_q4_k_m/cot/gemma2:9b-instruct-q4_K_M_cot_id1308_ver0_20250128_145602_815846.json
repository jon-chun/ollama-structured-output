Factors like lack of education, unemployment, and prior convictions are considered high-risk indicators. Conversely, no recent drug use is viewed as a mitigating factor. The overall prediction leans towards \"YES\" for 3-year rearrest due to the presence of several significant risk factors. However, the confidence level is moderate (65%) because some factors are less predictive and individual circumstances can vary greatly.\n\n\nRemember: This is a simplified example. Real-world risk assessments involve much more complex algorithms, data points, and expert judgment.",

He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
