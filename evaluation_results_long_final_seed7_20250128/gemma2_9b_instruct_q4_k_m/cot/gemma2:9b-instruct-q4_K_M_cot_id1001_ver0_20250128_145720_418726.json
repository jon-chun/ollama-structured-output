The confidence level is set at 75% because while the risk factors point towards a higher probability of rearrest, individual circumstances can always vary.\n\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n* This assessment is based solely on the provided information and should not be considered a definitive prediction of future behavior.\n* Risk assessments are complex and require a holistic evaluation considering various other factors not included here (e.g., offense type, victim impact, substance abuse history, support systems).\n* Ethical considerations are crucial in risk assessment.
