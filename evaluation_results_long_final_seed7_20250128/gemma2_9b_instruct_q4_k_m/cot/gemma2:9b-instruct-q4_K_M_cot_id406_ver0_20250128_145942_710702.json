It's not a guarantee of future behavior but rather an indication of the likelihood of recidivism based on the available data.\n\n\nRemember, risk assessments are tools to inform decision-making, not deterministic predictions. They should be used in conjunction with other information and professional judgment.",

He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
