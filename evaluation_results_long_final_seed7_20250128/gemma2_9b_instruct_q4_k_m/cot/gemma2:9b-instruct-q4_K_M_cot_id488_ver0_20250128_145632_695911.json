The weight assigned to each factor is based on established criminological research and statistical analysis.\n\n* **High Weight Factors:** Substance abuse (especially cocaine) and mental health issues (feeling depressed) are significant concerns. These factors suggest a higher potential for risk-taking behavior and instability.\n* **Medium Weight Factors:**  Being unmarried and living alone could indicate some level of instability, although his enrollment in school suggests positive efforts towards structure.\n\n* **Low Weight Factors:** Age, race/ethnicity, lack of prior convictions, physical characteristics, education/employment status, and childhood environment are not considered strong predictors of recidivism in this case. Religious beliefs also don't play a significant role.\n\n**Prediction:** The overall assessment predicts a \"YES\" to the likelihood of re-arrest within three years due to the high weight given to substance abuse and mental health concerns. \n\n\n**Important Note:**\n\nThis risk assessment is a tool to inform decision-making, not a deterministic prediction. It's crucial to consider individual circumstances, context, and other available information when making decisions about individuals.  \n",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 11 inches and weighs between 200 and 224 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone.
