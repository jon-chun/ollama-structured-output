He has been arrested 4 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in an urban area.
