He has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs between 225 and 249 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
