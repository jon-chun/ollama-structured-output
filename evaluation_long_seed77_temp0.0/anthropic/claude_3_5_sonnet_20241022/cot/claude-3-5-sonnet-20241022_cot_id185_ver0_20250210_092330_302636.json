He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area.
