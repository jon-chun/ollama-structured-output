He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month.
