Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
