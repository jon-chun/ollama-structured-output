    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, like in Example #1 and #12, often led to a YES outcome. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'6\" and 146 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone and never married. Many examples with people living alone, especially males, had higher recidivism. So this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education was a common factor in YES outcomes, like Example #1 and #14. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment can be protective, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability. Maybe a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use with marijuana. Many examples with drug use, especially marijuana, had varying outcomes, but it's a common factor in YES cases. So medium risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues like depression were sometimes linked to higher recidivism, but not feeling depressed might lower the risk. So low risk.\n\nLived in a household of size 5 as a child. Household size didn't seem to be a major factor, so low risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. In some examples, this was neutral or didn't strongly correlate. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are number of arrests/convictions and lack of education. Medium factors include age, living alone, and employment instability. The rest are low. So the prediction is YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and 1 conviction indicates a significant criminal history\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"lack of high school diploma or GED increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"holding 2 jobs suggests some instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"marijuana use is a common factor in recidivism\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone may indicate social isolation\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"no recent depression reported\"),\n    (\"household background\", \"low\", \"household size of 5 is not indicative of high risk\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"belief in God may have neutral or mixed effects\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
