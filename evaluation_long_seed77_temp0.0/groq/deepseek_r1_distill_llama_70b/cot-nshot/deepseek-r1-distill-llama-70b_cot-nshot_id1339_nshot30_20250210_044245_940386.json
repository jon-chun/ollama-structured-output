    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 20 isn't extremely young, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to YES and sometimes NO. So maybe medium risk here because the lack of conviction might lower the risk a bit.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'5\" and 146 lbs. That's average, so probably low risk since it's not particularly high or low.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living alone was a factor in some examples, but not living alone might mean more family support, which could lower the risk. So maybe low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, so medium risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job stability can be a protective factor, so this might be low risk.\n\nHe's used cocaine in the past four years. Cocaine is a harder drug than marijuana, which was more common in the examples. Drug use, especially harder drugs, is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so medium here.\n\nHe lived in a household of size six as a child. Larger households might have more support, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factor is drug use, especially cocaine. The medium factors are his age, arrest without conviction, education, and depression. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not super confident because some factors are protective. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (20 years old)\", \"medium\", \"Young adults are at a higher risk for recidivism, though 20 is not extremely young.\"),\n    (\"Single arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction shows some risk but not as high as multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"Average height and weight\", \"low\", \"No significant risk associated with average physical build.\"),\n    (\"Never married, not living alone\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide support, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"High school diploma, not in college\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma is positive, but not continuing education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Held 3 jobs in the past year\", \"low\", \"Job stability suggests lower risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Drug use (cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Cocaine use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Felt depressed some of the time\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Lived in a household of size 6\", \"low\", \"Larger households may offer more support, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"Believes in God's influence\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
