    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old White female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. From the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Since she's female, I wonder if that affects the risk differently. I'll note age as a medium risk factor because youth can sometimes correlate with higher impulsivity, but being female might lower it a bit.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, a single arrest without conviction doesn't always lead to a YES outcome. For example, Example #3 and #6 were NO despite one arrest. So maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 140 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried at a young age might indicate less stability. I'll mark this as medium because living alone could mean less support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor. Many examples with enrolled students, especially in college, had NO outcomes. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. However, having multiple jobs could also show responsibility. I'm a bit torn, but I'll lean towards medium risk because job instability might be a concern.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was present in both YES and NO cases. It's a common factor, so maybe medium risk since it's not as severe as other drugs but still a factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues like depression were present in some YES cases, but the absence here might lower the risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. In the examples, this factor didn't strongly correlate with outcomes, so I'll consider it low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The main concerns are her age and job changes, but her education and stable upbringing are positives. I think the prediction is NO, but I'm not very confident because some factors could go either way.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old, which is considered young and potentially associated with higher impulsivity, though being female may mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight, no indication of physical risk factors.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"job history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year could indicate instability or responsibility, depending on context.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can still indicate some level of risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, which reduces risk compared to individuals with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological parents in a stable household reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide emotional support, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
