    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old White female. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Since she's female, I wonder if that affects the risk differently. I'll note age as a medium risk factor because youth can sometimes correlate with higher impulsivity, but it's not the highest.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to YES and sometimes NO. For example, Example 3 was a male with one arrest, no conviction, and the outcome was NO. But Example 5, a male with two arrests and no conviction, had a YES. So maybe the number of arrests and gender play a role here. Since she's female and only one arrest, I might lean towards lower risk, so medium.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 128 lbs. Looking at the examples, weight and height don't seem to be strong predictors. Some heavier individuals had YES, others NO. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Living alone was a factor in some examples where people had higher risk, but she's not living alone. Maybe this indicates a more stable environment, so I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. In the examples, having a diploma sometimes correlated with lower risk, like Example 2 and 6. So education might be a protective factor, making this a low risk.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. In Example 5, the person had two jobs and still had a YES, but others with jobs had NO. Maybe having a job is slightly positive, so I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was present in many examples with both YES and NO outcomes. It's a common factor, so maybe it's a medium risk because it's indicative of possible substance issues but not the most severe.\n\nNo depression in the past month. In some examples, feeling down was linked to higher risk, like Example 4. Since she hasn't felt depressed, this might lower her risk, so low.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults as a child in an urban household. In Example 1, living with non-biological adults in an urban area led to a YES. This could indicate instability, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. In many examples, this factor didn't strongly correlate, but sometimes it was present in both YES and NO cases. I'll consider it low.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors with higher weight are age (medium), arrest without conviction (medium), drug use (medium), and living situation (medium). The rest are low. The combination leans towards a lower risk, so I'll predict NO with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not the highest risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction may indicate some risk but is not as severe as multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held 1 job during the year suggests some stability and responsibility, lowering the risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, indicating better socio-economic stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years could indicate some substance use issues, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone may indicate a more stable living environment, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No feelings of depression in the past month suggest better mental health, lowering the risk.\"),\n    (\"childhood living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults in a larger household could indicate instability in early life, which might increase risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
