    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to YES and sometimes NO. So maybe that's a low risk factor because the lack of conviction might reduce the likelihood.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and between 225-249 lbs. In the examples, being overweight didn't seem to directly correlate, but maybe it's a low factor since it's not consistently linked to recidivism.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone was common in many examples, both YES and NO. Maybe it's a low factor because it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective, so having a diploma might lower the risk, making this a low factor.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, so this might be a low risk factor as it suggests some stability.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was present in many cases, both YES and NO. It's a medium factor because it's a common issue but not the most severe.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nLiving in a household of size 5 as a child. Larger households might have more stress, but it's not a strong indicator, so low.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, so maybe a low factor as it could be protective.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risks are his age, drug use, and depression. However, having a diploma and employment are positive. The examples show that even with some risk factors, the outcome can be NO if there are enough protective factors. So I'm leaning towards a NO prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is within a higher risk age bracket for recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"1 arrest without conviction suggests lower risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"having held 2 jobs indicates some stability\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"high school diploma is a protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"marijuana use is a common risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"depression can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"living alone is common but not a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"household size alone isn't a strong predictor\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"religious beliefs may reduce recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
