    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, are strong indicators. For instance, Example #1 had one arrest and conviction leading to a YES. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 175-199 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme. So maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried might not be a big factor. Maybe medium risk because living alone could indicate less stability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism. So high risk.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a risk. Examples showed that having multiple jobs or none can be a factor. So medium risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a significant risk. Examples like #12 had multiple drugs leading to YES. So high risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health can be a factor, but since he hasn't felt depressed, maybe this is a low risk.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environment might have higher crime exposure, so medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, religious beliefs seemed to lower risk, so not having them might be a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are prior arrests/convictions, lack of education, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living situation, and urban upbringing. Low factors are no depression and no religious influence. So the prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held only 1 job in the past year suggests instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate social isolation.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment can expose to higher crime rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
