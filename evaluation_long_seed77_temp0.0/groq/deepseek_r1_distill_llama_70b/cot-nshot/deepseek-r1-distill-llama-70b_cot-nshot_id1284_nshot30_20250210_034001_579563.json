    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight to each based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Some led to YES and others NO. I think age alone isn't a strong indicator, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, some with one arrest and no conviction had NO outcomes, like Example 3 and 6. So maybe this is a medium risk factor because it's a first-time arrest without a conviction, which might lower the risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 140 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme. So I'll consider this low risk.\n\nLiving alone at 18 might indicate some instability, but in the examples, living alone was common and didn't always correlate with higher risk. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than not having one. In Example 1, not having a diploma led to a YES, but here he has a GED, so maybe this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nNo jobs held in the past year. In Example 4, having no jobs led to a YES, and in Example 15, it was also a factor. Unemployment seems to increase risk, so I'll mark this as high.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) is present. Many examples with drug use had YES outcomes, like Example 1 and 5. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nNo depression reported. In some examples, feeling down was linked to higher risk, but here he hasn't felt depressed, so this might be a low risk.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults as a child. In Example 1, living with non-biological adults led to a YES. This could indicate instability, so medium risk.\n\nBelief in God. In some examples, this was associated with both YES and NO outcomes. It might provide some stability, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are unemployment and drug use. The medium factors are arrest without conviction and living situation. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not too confident because some factors are mitigating. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old is within a range where some examples led to YES and others to NO, indicating moderate risk but not strongly predictive.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction is a moderate risk factor as seen in some examples leading to NO outcomes.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"No jobs held in the past year is a significant risk factor as seen in examples leading to YES outcomes.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a strong predictor as seen in multiple examples leading to YES outcomes.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate instability, contributing to a medium risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED is a protective factor, lowering the risk compared to not having one.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"childhood_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults indicates some instability, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide stability, lowering the risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
