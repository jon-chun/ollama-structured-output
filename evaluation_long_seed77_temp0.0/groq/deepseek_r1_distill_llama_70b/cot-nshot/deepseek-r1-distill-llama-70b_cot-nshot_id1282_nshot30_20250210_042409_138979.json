    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, often led to a higher risk. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 180 lbs. Looking at the examples, weight and height alone didn't seem to be major factors unless extreme. So I think this is low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried might not be a big factor on its own. Maybe low risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor. Lack of education often correlated with higher recidivism in the examples. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment was a significant factor in the examples. People without jobs were more likely to reoffend. So high risk here.\n\nDrug use with marijuana in the past four years. Drug use was a factor, but in the examples, marijuana alone wasn't as bad as harder drugs. So maybe medium risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently. Mental health issues, especially depression, were a factor in some cases. Since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk a bit. So low risk.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults as a child in an urban area. Unstable living situations, especially in urban areas, can increase risk. So medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In the examples, this sometimes was a protective factor, but not always. So maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are number of arrests/convictions, lack of education, unemployment. Medium factors are young age, living situation. Low factors are the rest. So the prediction is YES, with high confidence around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is within a high-risk age group for recidivism, as young adults are more likely to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"6 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to financial instability and criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a factor, though not as severe as harder drugs, but still indicative of potential issues.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone in an urban area, especially with a history of living with non-biological adults, may contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reported, which might reduce immediate risk factors.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide some protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
