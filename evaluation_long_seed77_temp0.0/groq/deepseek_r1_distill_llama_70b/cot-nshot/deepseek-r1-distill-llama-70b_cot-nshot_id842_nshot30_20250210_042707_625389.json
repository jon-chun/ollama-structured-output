    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher recidivism rates because they're still in a phase where they might make impulsive decisions. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has been convicted. In the examples, multiple arrests and convictions often led to higher recidivism. For instance, Example #1 had one arrest and conviction leading to YES, while others with more arrests sometimes had NO. But two arrests and a conviction seem significant, so I'll mark this as high risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 145 lbs. This is average, so I don't think it's a significant factor. Probably low risk.\n\nLiving alone at 18 might indicate some instability or lack of support, which could contribute to higher risk. I've seen in some examples that living alone was a factor, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHaving held one job in the past year suggests some employment, but maybe not stable. Unstable employment can be a risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine is a significant factor. Drug use often correlates with higher recidivism, so this is a high risk.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this is low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a small household is a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor. So low risk here.\n\nBelief in God might provide some support and lower recidivism, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are prior convictions and drug use. Medium factors include living alone and unstable employment. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not super confident because education and stable upbringing might help. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not as high as younger ages.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism based on the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate limited support systems, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school is a protective factor that may reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests some instability, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk compared to those who experience depression.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a small household is a stable upbringing, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide emotional support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
