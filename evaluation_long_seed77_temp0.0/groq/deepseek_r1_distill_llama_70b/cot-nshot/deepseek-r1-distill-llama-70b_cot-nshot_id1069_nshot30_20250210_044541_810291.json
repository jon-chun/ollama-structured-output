    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, are strong indicators. Example #1 had one arrest and conviction leading to a YES. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 155 lbs. These are average, so I don't think they contribute much. Low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common in both YES and NO outcomes, so maybe it's a medium factor. It could indicate instability but isn't definitive.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education is a big factor. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism. So high risk.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor. Without a stable job, it's harder to reintegrate. High risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana in the past four years. Many examples with drug use had varying outcomes, but it's still a risk. Maybe medium since it's only marijuana, not harder drugs.\n\nNot feeling depressed. Mental health can be a factor, but not feeling depressed might lower the risk a bit. So low.\n\nLiving with biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. In some examples, this was a protective factor, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are number of arrests/convictions, lack of education, unemployment. Medium factors are age, living situation, urban environment. Low factors are mental health and religious beliefs. So the prediction leans towards YES, but confidence isn't 100% because some factors might mitigate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is within a high-risk age group for recidivism, as younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a significant history of criminal activity, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Held no jobs during the year, indicating instability and lack of legitimate income sources, which are risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor but less severe than harder drugs, yet still indicative of potential substance-related issues.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may contribute to isolation and lack of support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No feelings of depression reported, which may reduce the risk of recidivism compared to those with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area may expose to higher crime environments but also provides some family support.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a protective factor against recidivism by offering a sense of purpose or moral guidance.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
