    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old White female who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From the examples, I saw that younger individuals, especially those around 18-20, had varying outcomes. But 22 isn't too young, so maybe age isn't a huge factor here. I'll consider it low risk.\n\nShe's female. Looking at the examples, most cases were males, but some females had \"YES\" outcomes. However, being female might generally lower recidivism risk, so I'll mark gender as low.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a single arrest sometimes led to \"YES\" and sometimes \"NO.\" Since she was convicted, that might indicate a higher risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 145 lbs. These are average, so I don't see them as significant risk factors. Low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but not married could indicate instability. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not being enrolled might limit her opportunities, so medium risk.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, so medium.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor, so high.\n\nShe's felt depressed most of the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so high.\n\nLiving with her biological dad in an urban area at a young age. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so medium.\n\nBelieves God influences her life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are drug use and depression, which are strong indicators. Medium factors include conviction, living alone, job instability, and urban upbringing. Despite some protective factors like gender and belief, the high-risk factors might tip the prediction towards \"YES.\" Confidence is around 75% because while there are strong factors, some elements like having a GED and gender might reduce the risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is considered young but not exceptionally high risk compared to younger individuals.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female may have a slightly lower recidivism rate compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction could indicate some risk but is not excessively high.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married might indicate some instability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college could limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests some instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Feeling depressed most of the time is a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living situation at a young age\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment might expose to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may act as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
