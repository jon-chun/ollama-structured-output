    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a conviction, even with one arrest, sometimes led to a YES outcome, like in Example 1. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'3\" and 180 lbs. Looking at the examples, taller and heavier individuals didn't always correlate with higher risk, but maybe being above average could be a low risk factor, though not as significant.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone was common in many examples, both YES and NO. Maybe it's a low risk factor because it's quite common and doesn't strongly indicate higher risk on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. This seems important. In the examples, lacking education often correlated with higher recidivism, like in Example 1 and Example 14. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Unstable employment, like having few jobs, was a factor in some YES cases. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nDrug use with marijuana in the past four years. Many examples had drug use, but it didn't always lead to YES. However, combined with other factors, it might contribute. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the past month. Depression was a factor in some YES cases, like Example 5 and Example 12. So that's a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother at a young age in a household of size 5. Stable family environment might lower risk, but since he's living alone now, maybe it's not as impactful. So low risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, not considering God had mixed outcomes, but maybe it's a low risk factor as it's not a strong indicator.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are conviction and lack of education. Medium factors include age, employment, drug use, and depression. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates a higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"6 feet 3 inches and 180 lbs is above average but not significantly indicative\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Never married and living alone is common and not strongly indicative\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job during the year suggests some instability\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time could indicate emotional instability\"),\n    (\"living situation at young age\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a household of size 5 is relatively stable\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Not considering God's influence is not strongly indicative\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
