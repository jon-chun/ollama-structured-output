    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher risk because they're in a transitional phase and might not have stable life structures yet. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to YES and sometimes NO. Since there's no conviction, maybe it's a lower risk, but the fact that he was arrested still counts. So I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 220 lbs. In the examples, being overweight or underweight sometimes correlated with higher risk, possibly due to health issues or other underlying factors. His weight is on the higher side, so maybe a low to medium risk here. I'll go with medium because it's a noticeable factor.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could indicate a lack of support system, which might increase risk. In the examples, living alone often was a factor in higher recidivism. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can reduce recidivism by providing structure and opportunities. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHaving held two jobs in the past year shows some stability and responsibility, which is a positive sign. Employment can reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, is present. In the examples, drug use often increased the risk, sometimes leading to YES outcomes. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nNo feelings of depression in the past month is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so the absence here is good. Low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household of size 5 in a rural area suggests a supportive environment, which is a protective factor. Low risk.\n\nBelief in God can provide a support system and moral framework, which might reduce recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are mixed. The positives like education, employment, stable upbringing, and mental health are strong. The negatives are the arrest, living alone, and drug use. However, since he's enrolled in school and has a job, these might outweigh the negatives. So I'm leaning towards a NO prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is a transitional age that may pose a moderate risk for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrested 1 time but not convicted\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some risk but not as high as multiple arrests.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"medium\", \"Being 6 feet 0 inches and 220 lbs may indicate potential health or behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age can indicate a lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"enrolled in school\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"held 2 jobs during the year\", \"low\", \"Employment is a stabilizing factor that reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"no depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed reduces the risk of negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"lived with biological parents\", \"low\", \"A stable family environment is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"believes in God\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
