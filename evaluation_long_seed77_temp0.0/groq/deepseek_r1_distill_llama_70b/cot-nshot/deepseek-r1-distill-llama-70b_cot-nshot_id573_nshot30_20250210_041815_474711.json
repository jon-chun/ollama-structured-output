    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old White female based on the given risk factors and the examples provided. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight to them.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Since she's female, I wonder if gender plays a role. In the examples, females had both YES and NO outcomes, but maybe being younger is a moderate risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, some with one arrest and no conviction had NO outcomes, like Example 3 and 6. But others with similar stats had YES, like Example 13. So maybe this is a medium risk factor because it's a first-time arrest without conviction, which might lower the risk, but not entirely.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'9\" and 125-149 lbs. In the examples, weight didn't seem to be a major factor unless it was extreme. So I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried is standard for 18-year-olds. Maybe this is a low risk factor since it's typical for her age.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education seems to be a protective factor. In the examples, those enrolled in college often had NO outcomes, like Example 6 and 16. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held 1 job during the year. Having a job could indicate stability, which might lower recidivism risk. In the examples, those with jobs sometimes had lower risk, so maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a significant risk factor. In the examples, drug use often correlated with higher recidivism, like Example 1 and 12. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues, like depression, can increase recidivism risk, but since she hasn't felt depressed, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nLiving with adoptive parents in a small household in an urban area. Urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates, but living with adoptive parents could provide stability. Household size of 2 is small, which might be less risky than larger households. So maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence in her life. In the examples, those who considered God's influence had mixed outcomes. Not considering it might be a low risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant this is.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. However, she has protective factors like education and employment. The lack of conviction and stable living situation might lower her risk. So I'm leaning towards a NO prediction, but with moderate confidence because drug use is a significant concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is considered young, which can be a risk factor for recidivism as younger individuals may still be developing impulse control and life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrested 1 time but not convicted\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction may indicate a lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions, but it still shows some engagement with the criminal justice system.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are within normal ranges and do not strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common and does not necessarily indicate a higher risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"high school diploma and enrolled in college\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college are positive factors that reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"held 1 job during the year\", \"low\", \"Employment is a stabilizing factor and reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to impaired judgment and illegal activities.\"),\n    (\"no depression\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed reduces the risk of recidivism compared to individuals who experience mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"lived with adoptive parents in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Living with adoptive parents in an urban area may have both stabilizing and destabilizing factors depending on the environment and support system.\"),\n    (\"does not consider God's influence\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may not be a significant risk factor, but it can vary based on individual coping mechanisms.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
