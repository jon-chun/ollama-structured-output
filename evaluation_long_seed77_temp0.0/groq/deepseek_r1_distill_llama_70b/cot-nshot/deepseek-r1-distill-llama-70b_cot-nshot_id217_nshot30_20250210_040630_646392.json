    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Black female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those under 21, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female, and looking at the examples, males are more likely to recidivate. So being female could lower her risk, maybe a low factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially those convicted, had higher risks. Since she's only arrested once and not convicted, this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'9\" and 275 lbs. Obesity can sometimes be a factor, but in the examples, weight didn't seem to directly correlate. Maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone was common in many examples, both YES and NO outcomes. Maybe this is a low factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education, especially being enrolled, seems to reduce recidivism. So this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be protective, but having only one job might indicate instability. Maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor, so this is high.\n\nShe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so medium.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environment might have higher risks, but living with a biological parent is stable. Maybe medium.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. In examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a big concern, but her education and being female might lower the risk. I'm leaning towards a YES prediction, but not too confident because of the conflicting factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female generally correlates with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest and no conviction suggests lower risk compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"While obesity can have health implications, it's not directly linked to recidivism in the examples provided.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Never married and living alone is common across many examples without strong correlation to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college are protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held one job during the year suggests some stability but could indicate limited employment history.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling depressed some of the time can increase vulnerability to negative behaviors.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area may have mixed influences on recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be a protective factor, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
