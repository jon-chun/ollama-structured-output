    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old White female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Since she's female, I wonder if that affects the risk differently. Maybe lower risk compared to males, but I'm not sure.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. Looking at the examples, some with one arrest and no conviction had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example 3 and 6. So that might be a lower risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 100-124 lbs. In the examples, weight didn't seem to be a major factor unless it was extreme. So maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Living with others might provide more support, which could reduce the risk. In Example 10, a female not living alone had a \"NO\" outcome. So this might be a low risk.\n\nShe's enrolled in school. Education is usually a protective factor. Many examples where the person was enrolled in college had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example 6 and 16. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held 2 jobs during the year. Having employment can be stabilizing, which might lower recidivism risk. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was present in both \"YES\" and \"NO\" outcomes. It might be a medium risk factor because it's a common factor but not as severe as harder drugs.\n\nShe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. In Example 4, feeling down led to a \"YES\" outcome. So this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is probably a low risk.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this didn't seem to affect the outcome much, so maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk. The main concerns are the drug use and depression, which are medium. But overall, the protective factors like education and stable living situation might outweigh the risks. So I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"18 years old is considered young but not exceptionally high risk compared to younger ages.\"),\n    (\"arrested 1 time, not convicted\", \"low\", \"First-time arrest without conviction suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average build, no indication of heightened risk.\"),\n    (\"never married, not living alone\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide support and reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"enrolled in school\", \"low\", \"Education is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"held 2 jobs\", \"low\", \"Employment suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marijuana use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use is a risk factor but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"felt depressed some of the time\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"lived with biological parents\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"doesn't consider God's influence\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
