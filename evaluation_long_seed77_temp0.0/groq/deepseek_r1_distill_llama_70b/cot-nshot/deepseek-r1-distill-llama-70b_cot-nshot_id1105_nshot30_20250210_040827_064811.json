    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old Hispanic female based on the given risk factors and the examples provided. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight to them.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Looking at the examples, most of the individuals are around 18-22, and some who are younger have higher recidivism. But 20 is on the lower side, so maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's female. From the examples, females tend to have lower recidivism rates. Most of the 'YES' outcomes are males, so being female might be a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nShe's Hispanic. The examples don't show a strong correlation with race/ethnicity, so maybe this is a low factor.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with one arrest but not convicted often have 'NO' outcomes, so this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'4\" and 145 lbs. This is average, so probably low risk.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Living with others might provide support, so low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nHeld 4 jobs in the year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, so low risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Some examples with drug use had 'YES' outcomes, but marijuana alone might be a medium risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but she's not feeling depressed, so low risk.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area. Stable family environment, so low risk.\n\nDoesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this was a protective factor, but not sure. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk. The only medium is drug use. So overall, the prediction is 'NO' with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old is within a lower risk age range for recidivism compared to younger individuals.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female is associated with lower recidivism rates in the provided examples.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic background does not strongly correlate with higher recidivism in the examples.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest with no conviction suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not indicate heightened risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Never married but not living alone may indicate social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding four jobs indicates stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment lowers risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence doesn't strongly correlate with risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
