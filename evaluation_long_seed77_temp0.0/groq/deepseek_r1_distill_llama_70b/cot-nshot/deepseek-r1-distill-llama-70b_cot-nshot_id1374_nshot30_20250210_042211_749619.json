    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might engage in riskier behaviors. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to YES and sometimes NO. Without a conviction, maybe the offense was minor, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'0\" and 175-199 lbs. This is average, so I don't think it's a significant factor. Probably low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could increase risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be protective, so having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, leading to medium risk.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but only having one job might indicate instability. So, medium risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. High risk here.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not feeling depressed, this might be a protective factor. Low risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family environment is a positive, so low risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, religious beliefs were a protective factor, so not having them might slightly increase risk, but I'm not sure. Maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a big concern. The medium factors like living alone, education, and employment add up. But the stable upbringing and lack of depression are positives. I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not super confident because there are mitigating factors. Maybe 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not as high as younger ages.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job suggests some stability, but limited employment history could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of impulsive or self-destructive behavior.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
