    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old Black male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight to each based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Looking at the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Some led to YES, others NO. Age alone isn't a strong indicator, so I'll consider it a low risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, a single arrest without conviction sometimes led to YES (like Example 1) and sometimes NO (like Example 2). So this is a medium risk factor because it's not as severe as multiple arrests but still a concern.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'4\" and 125-149 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone was common in many examples, both YES and NO. Not being married is also common, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education can be protective. Having a diploma might lower recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment was a factor in some YES cases (like Example 4), so this is a medium risk factor because lack of employment can increase recidivism risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was present in both YES and NO cases. It's a moderate risk because it's a common factor but not the most severe.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently. Mental health issues like depression were present in some YES cases, so not feeling depressed might lower the risk, making this a low factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a small household in a rural area. Family support can be protective, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In some examples, this was present in both outcomes, so it's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are the single arrest without conviction and unemployment. However, having a diploma and living with family are positives. The other factors are low risks. So, the overall prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old is within a range where recidivism risk is moderate, but not excessively high.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction shows some risk but is not indicative of a high recidivism rate.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"No jobs held during the year could indicate instability and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Marijuana use is common and not strongly correlated with high recidivism in the examples.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common in many cases, both with and without recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk compared to those with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother suggests a stable upbringing, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God is present in both high and low risk cases, so it's neutral.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
