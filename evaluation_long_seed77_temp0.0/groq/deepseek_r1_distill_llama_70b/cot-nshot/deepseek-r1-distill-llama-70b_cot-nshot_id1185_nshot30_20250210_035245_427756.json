    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 21-year-old Black male with specific risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one, considering the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those around 18-20, sometimes had higher recidivism, but 21 is still young. I'm not sure if this is a high or medium risk factor. Maybe medium because it's not too low but not extremely high.\n\nHe's been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with convictions, often led to a higher risk. For example, in Example #1, 1 arrest and conviction led to YES. So 3 arrests and a conviction might be a high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'7\", which is average height. I don't see height being a significant factor in the examples, so maybe low risk.\n\nNever married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but I'm not sure if it's a strong indicator. Maybe medium because it could relate to social support, but not the highest.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than not having one. In some examples, having a diploma or GED reduced risk. So this might be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held 4 jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having multiple jobs could indicate instability, but it's better than having none. Maybe medium because frequent job changes might suggest instability, but employment itself is positive.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. This is a positive factor, so low risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health can influence recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nLived with biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally stable. Maybe medium because urban area could be a risk, but living with a parent is a protective factor.\n\nDoesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, religious beliefs were a protective factor. So not having this might slightly increase risk, but it's probably low.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risk factors are the number of arrests and convictions. Employment is a bit of a mixed signal. The lack of drug use and depression are positives. Urban living is a slight negative. So overall, I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not extremely confident because some factors are positive. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not as high as younger individuals.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal involvement, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"5 feet 7 inches is average height and does not significantly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED certificate suggests some level of education, which can be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding 4 jobs in a year may indicate instability, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive factor that reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No feelings of depression in the past month suggests better mental health, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation at a young age\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area may provide some stability but urban environments can have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Not considering God's influence may reduce a potential protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
