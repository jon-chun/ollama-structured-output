    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 20 isn't too young, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a conviction, even with one arrest, sometimes led to a YES, like Example 1. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'3\" and 170 lbs. That's tall but not overly heavy. I don't see a strong correlation in the examples between height/weight and recidivism, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe's married but living alone. Marriage could be a stabilizing factor, but living alone might indicate isolation. In Example 21, a married person living with spouse had a NO outcome, but here he's alone. Maybe medium risk because living alone might not provide the same support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. In some examples, having a diploma didn't always prevent recidivism, but not being enrolled might mean less structure. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a big risk factor. Examples like 4 and 15 had no jobs and resulted in YES or NO, but unemployment is generally linked to higher recidivism. So high risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Most examples with no drug use had lower risk, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since he's not feeling depressed, that's a low risk.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background might lower risk, so low.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, a lack of religious belief was linked to higher risk, like Example 5. So maybe medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are conviction and unemployment. Medium factors are age, living alone, no college, and lack of religious influence. Low factors are the rest. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a YES prediction, but not super confident because some factors are low. Maybe 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested once and convicted indicates a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No significant correlation between height/weight and recidivism observed in examples.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Being married may reduce risk, but living alone could indicate isolation or lack of support.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college might indicate lack of engagement.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Holding no jobs during the year is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No feelings of depression in the past month lowers this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may slightly increase risk based on some examples.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
