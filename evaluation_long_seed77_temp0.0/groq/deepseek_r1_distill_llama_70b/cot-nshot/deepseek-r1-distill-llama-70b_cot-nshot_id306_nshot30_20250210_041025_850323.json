    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 19-year-old White female who hasn't been convicted despite one arrest. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. From the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Since she's female, I remember that in the examples, females generally had lower recidivism. So maybe age isn't a huge factor here, but being young could still be a moderate risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, some with one arrest and no conviction had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example 3 and 6. So maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 127 lbs. Looking at the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme. So I'll consider this low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried didn't strongly correlate. Maybe a low risk here.\n\nShe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Many examples where the person was enrolled had \"NO\" outcomes, so this is probably a protective factor, low risk.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate some instability. Maybe a medium risk.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. She used marijuana and cocaine, which in the examples often led to higher recidivism, like Example 1 and 12. So this is a high-risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. In the examples, mental health issues sometimes increased risk, but the absence here might lower it. So low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a stable household. This is a protective factor, as seen in some examples where stable family environments led to \"NO\" outcomes. So low risk.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence, which in some examples correlated with lower recidivism, but not a strong factor. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high drug use is a big concern, but being in school and a stable home are positives. The lack of conviction and being female might lower the risk. So I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old is within a range where some examples showed lower recidivism, especially for females.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest with no conviction is a lower risk as seen in several examples.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having one job indicates some stability but not as strong as more employment.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor as seen in multiple examples leading to 'YES' outcomes.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common but not a strong indicator on its own.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school is a protective factor associated with lower recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable household with biological parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence doesn't strongly correlate with higher risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
