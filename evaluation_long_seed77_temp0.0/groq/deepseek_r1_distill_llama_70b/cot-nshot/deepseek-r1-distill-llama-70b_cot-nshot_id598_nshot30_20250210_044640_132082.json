    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 19-year-old White male. Let me go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight to each based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Looking at the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Some led to YES and others to NO. I think age alone isn't a strong indicator, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a single arrest with conviction sometimes led to YES (Example 1) and sometimes NO (Example 2). So maybe medium risk here because it's a first offense but with a conviction.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 160 lbs. Most examples didn't show a clear trend based on physical build, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone was common in many examples, both YES and NO. Maybe medium because living alone could indicate less stability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. In some cases, having a diploma seemed to lower risk (Example 2), but not always. So maybe medium.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment, like holding few jobs, was a factor in some YES cases (Example 1 had 3 jobs, but others with fewer jobs also had YES). So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe used marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple drugs, was a significant factor in many YES outcomes (Examples 1, 5, 12, etc.). So high risk here.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Some examples with no depression still had YES outcomes, so maybe low risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family environment might lower risk, so medium.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this was linked to higher risk (Example 5), so maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the drug use is a strong indicator, but other factors are mixed. I think the prediction is YES with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"19 years old is within a range where recidivism can vary, but not strongly indicative on its own.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"First-time arrest with conviction shows some risk but isn't definitive.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No clear correlation with recidivism in examples.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate instability but isn't conclusive.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma might reduce risk but isn't certain.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"One job suggests some instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs is a strong indicator of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, which might lower risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Stable family could reduce risk but isn't certain.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence might slightly increase risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
