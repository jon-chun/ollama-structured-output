    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. In the examples, multiple arrests without conviction sometimes led to YES outcomes, like Example #1 and #5, but others like Example #3 and #6 were NO. So maybe this is a medium risk factor because the lack of conviction might lower the risk a bit.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 215 lbs. Looking at the examples, larger individuals sometimes had higher risk, like Example #14, but others didn't. I'm not sure if this is a significant factor, so maybe low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living alone was common in many examples, both YES and NO. Maybe it's a low risk factor since it's not strongly correlated.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education seems protective; many with college enrollment had NO outcomes, like Example #6 and #16. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs in the past year. Stable employment can be a protective factor, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially multiple drugs, was a high risk factor in several YES cases, like Example #12 and #23. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues sometimes increased risk, but the absence might lower it, so low.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background might be protective, so low.\n\nDoesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this didn't seem to affect much, but maybe it's a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risks are his age, multiple arrests, and drug use. However, his education and employment might mitigate these. So I'm leaning towards a YES prediction, but with moderate confidence because of the mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"20 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction indicate some risk but not as high as multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment history is protective.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
