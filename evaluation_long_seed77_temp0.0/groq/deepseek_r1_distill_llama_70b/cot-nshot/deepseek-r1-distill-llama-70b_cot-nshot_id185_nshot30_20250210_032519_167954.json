    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Asian/Pacific Islander male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, had varying outcomes. Age itself isn't a strong indicator, but being young might mean more life instability, so I'll consider it a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, some with one arrest and no conviction had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example 2 and 3. However, others with similar stats sometimes recidivated. So, this might be a low risk factor since no conviction could mean less severe offense.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. Looking at the examples, size didn't seem to be a significant factor unless extreme, which this isn't. So, I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common among those who recidivated, but it's also common in many cases. It might indicate isolation or lack of support, so I'll consider it a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor; having a diploma is good, but not being enrolled might mean less structured time. This could be a low risk factor since education generally reduces recidivism.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Without a job, he might have financial instability, leading to higher risk. This is a high risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Drug use was a significant factor in many examples that led to \"YES\" outcomes. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk if untreated. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, religious beliefs were associated with lower recidivism, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: high risk from unemployment, medium from depression and living alone, the rest are low. The examples show that unemployment and mental health issues can significantly increase recidivism. However, the lack of drug use and stable upbringing might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction because the protective factors might outweigh the risks, but I'm not very confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old, which is young but not a strong indicator on its own\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"1 arrest with no conviction suggests lower severity\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"unemployment increases financial instability risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"high school diploma is protective\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"living alone may indicate isolation\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"depression can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"stable upbringing is protective\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"lack of religious influence may have mixed effects\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
