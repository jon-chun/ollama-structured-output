    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old mixed-race female based on the given risk factors and the examples provided. Let me go through each factor one by one and assign a weight to them.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those around 18-20, seem to have varying outcomes. Since she's female, I'm not sure how that affects it, but age might still be a moderate risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, some with one arrest and no conviction had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example 3 and 6. So maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'5\" and 120 lbs. Looking at the examples, weight and height don't seem to be significant factors unless extreme, which this isn't. So probably low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but I'm not sure if that's a significant factor. Maybe low.\n\nShe's enrolled in school. Education seems to be a protective factor. For example, Example 5 had someone enrolled in college and still had a \"YES\", but others with education had \"NO\". So maybe medium, as education can reduce recidivism.\n\nShe's held 2 jobs. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so maybe low risk.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was common in both \"YES\" and \"NO\" cases. But since it's only marijuana, maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so that's probably a medium factor.\n\nLiving in a household of size 6 as a child. Larger households might indicate instability, so maybe medium risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life. In examples, this didn't seem to correlate strongly, so maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors that stand out are her age, depression, and drug use. However, she's in school and has jobs, which are positive. The examples show that even with some risk factors, if there are protective factors like education, the outcome might be \"NO\". So I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Being 18 years old may indicate youth, which can be a risk factor for impulsive behavior, but also a time for intervention and growth.\"),\n    (\"arrested 1 time, not convicted\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common and not a strong indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"enrolled in school\", \"medium\", \"Education can be a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"held 2 jobs\", \"low\", \"Employment generally reduces recidivism risk, indicating stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can increase recidivism risk, especially if linked to other factors.\"),\n    (\"felt depressed\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed.\"),\n    (\"household size 6\", \"medium\", \"Larger households may indicate instability or stress, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"believes in God\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
