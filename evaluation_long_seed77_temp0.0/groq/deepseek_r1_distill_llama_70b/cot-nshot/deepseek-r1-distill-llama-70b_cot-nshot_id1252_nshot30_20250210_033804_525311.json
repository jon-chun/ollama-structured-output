    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, I saw that younger individuals, especially those around 18-20, sometimes had higher recidivism, but 21 might be on the lower end of that risk. I'm not sure if age alone is a strong factor here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, some people with one arrest and no conviction had \"NO\" outcomes, like Example #3 and #6. So maybe this is a lower risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'8\" and 145 lbs. That's quite tall and underweight. I don't recall height and weight being significant in the examples, so maybe this isn't a major factor. Perhaps low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but I'm not sure if that's a strong indicator. Maybe medium risk because social isolation could be a factor, but not the strongest.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This seems important. In the examples, lack of education often correlated with higher recidivism. For instance, Example #1 had no diploma and was a YES. So this might be a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment can be a protective factor. Having steady jobs might reduce recidivism, so maybe this is a low risk.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. In the examples, drug use sometimes led to YES outcomes, like Example #1 and #5. So this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues, like feeling down, sometimes increased recidivism in the examples. Since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk, so maybe low.\n\nLiving with biological mother in a household of size 4. Stable family environment might reduce risk, so perhaps low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In the examples, this sometimes correlated with lower recidivism, like Example #2 and #4. So maybe this is a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of education is a high-risk factor, drug use is medium, and the rest are low. The employment is a positive. So overall, I think the prediction is NO, but I'm not very confident because the education factor is strong. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 is young but not as high risk as younger ages\"),\n    (\"arrested once, not convicted\", \"low\", \"No conviction reduces risk\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Not significant in examples\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Possible social isolation\"),\n    (\"no education\", \"high\", \"Strong indicator in examples\"),\n    (\"two jobs\", \"low\", \"Employment is protective\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in examples sometimes led to YES\"),\n    (\"no depression\", \"low\", \"Mental health not an issue\"),\n    (\"stable household\", \"low\", \"Positive factor\"),\n    (\"religious belief\", \"low\", \"Can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
