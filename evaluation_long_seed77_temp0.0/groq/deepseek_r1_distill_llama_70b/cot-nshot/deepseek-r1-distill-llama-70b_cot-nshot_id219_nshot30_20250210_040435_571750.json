    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, are strong indicators. For instance, Example #1 had one arrest and conviction leading to a YES. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 165 lbs. In the examples, weight and height didn't seem to play a significant role unless extreme, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried might not be a strong indicator on its own. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education, especially being enrolled, seems to lower recidivism. For example, Example #2 had a diploma and was not enrolled, but still had a NO outcome. So education here might be a protective factor, low risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so having multiple jobs might lower risk. But if it's unstable, maybe not. I'll say low risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine is a significant factor. Many examples with drug use, especially multiple substances, led to YES outcomes. So high risk.\n\nHe's feeling down some of the time. Depression or low mood can increase recidivism risk, so medium risk.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family background might lower risk, so low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high arrest/conviction history and drug use are strong predictors. Education and employment might help, but the drug use and multiple arrests are significant. So I'm leaning towards a YES prediction with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a significant criminal history\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college may reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"holding 3 jobs suggests some stability, reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"use of marijuana and cocaine increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"some feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"living alone may not significantly increase risk\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"living with biological parents suggests a stable upbringing\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"belief in God may provide protective factors against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
