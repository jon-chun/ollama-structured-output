    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old White female who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From the examples, younger individuals, especially males, seem to have higher recidivism, but she's female, which might lower the risk a bit. I'll mark age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a single arrest with conviction sometimes led to YES, like Example 1, but others like Example 2 were NO. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so probably not a significant factor. I'll consider this low risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone was common in many examples, both YES and NO. Maybe it's a low risk factor since it's not strongly correlated.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education, especially being enrolled, seems to reduce recidivism. In Example 2, having a diploma led to NO. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held 3 jobs in the past year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism, so this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was present in both YES and NO cases. It's a moderate risk, maybe medium.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues like depression were sometimes linked to higher recidivism, so not feeling depressed might lower the risk. This could be a low factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a rural area. Stable family environment might reduce risk, so low.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. In some examples, this was associated with lower recidivism, so maybe a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The conviction and drug use are the main concerns, but her education and employment are positives. I think the prediction is NO with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young but not a high-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction may indicate some risk but is not a strong predictor on its own.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common and not strongly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education and enrollment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding three jobs indicates stability, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological parents indicates a stable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
