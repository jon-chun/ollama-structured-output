    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old Hispanic male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 22 isn't too young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, a single arrest with conviction sometimes led to YES, like Example 1, but others with similar stats had NO. So maybe this is a medium risk.\n\nHis height and weight are average, 5'9\" and 180 lbs. I don't see height/weight being a major factor unless extreme, so probably low risk here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage and stable living arrangements often reduce recidivism. In Example 21, being married led to a NO outcome, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED, which is better than not having one. Education can lower recidivism, so this is a low risk.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs in the past year. Stable employment usually reduces risk, so this is a low factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was present in both YES and NO cases. It's a moderate risk, maybe medium.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since he's not feeling depressed, this is low.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults as a child. In Example 1, living with non-biological adults led to YES, so this might be a medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, this was linked to higher risk, like Example 5, so maybe medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors leaning towards YES are the conviction, living situation as a child, and drug use. But he's married, employed, and has a GED, which are protective. I think the risk is moderate, so prediction is NO with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a range associated with moderate recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some risk but not extensive\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average build, not indicative of higher risk\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse suggests stability\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Having a GED reduces recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Steady employment reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk\"),\n    (\"living situation as a child\", \"medium\", \"Non-biological adults in household may indicate instability\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may correlate with higher risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
