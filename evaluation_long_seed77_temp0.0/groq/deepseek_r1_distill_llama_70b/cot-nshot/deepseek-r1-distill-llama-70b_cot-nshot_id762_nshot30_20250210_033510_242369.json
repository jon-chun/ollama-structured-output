    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. But 21 isn't too young, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. In the examples, multiple arrests without conviction sometimes led to YES, like Example #1, but others like Example #3 were NO. So maybe medium risk here because the lack of conviction might lower it a bit.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 195 lbs. That's average, so probably low risk since it's not particularly high or low.\n\nLiving alone and never married. In the examples, living alone often correlated with higher risk, like Example #1 and #5. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor. In Example #2, having a diploma led to NO. So this might lower his risk, maybe low.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Stable employment can reduce recidivism. Example #5 had 2 jobs and was YES, but others with jobs were NO. So maybe low risk here.\n\nDrug use is marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use was present in both YES and NO cases, but it's less severe than other drugs. So maybe medium risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues like depression were a factor in some YES cases, so not feeling depressed might lower the risk, maybe low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in a rural area. Stable family environment is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. In some examples, this was associated with lower recidivism, like Example #2 and #4. So maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors leaning towards lower risk are education, employment, stable upbringing, and no depression. The medium factors are age and arrests without conviction. So overall, I think the prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction indicate some risk but not as severe as multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone is a known risk factor for recidivism as it may indicate social isolation.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding three jobs suggests stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor compared to harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological parents in a stable household is protective.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
