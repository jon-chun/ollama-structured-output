    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White female who has been arrested twice and convicted once. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. From the examples, younger individuals, especially those under 21, seem to have a higher risk. Since she's just a bit older, maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Looking at the examples, most cases are male, but some females also had positive outcomes. Gender alone might not be a strong indicator, so maybe low risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and convicted once. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially with convictions, often led to a higher risk. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHer weight is 272 lbs. Obesity can sometimes be linked to health issues, which might contribute to other factors like depression. I'm not sure how much this directly relates to recidivism, but maybe it's a medium risk.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone is common in the examples, and it didn't always correlate with high risk, but maybe it's a medium factor because social support is lower.\n\nShe has a GED and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is usually a protective factor. Being enrolled might reduce recidivism risk, so this could be a low risk factor.\n\nHeld one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk, but having some employment might mitigate that. Maybe medium risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine is a significant factor. Drug use, especially multiple substances, is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk. So high risk here.\n\nShe's feeling down most of the time. Depression or low mental state can increase recidivism, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nLiving with her biological mother as a child in an urban area. Stable family environment might lower risk, but urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates. Maybe medium risk.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, religious belief was a protective factor. Not having it might slightly increase risk, so medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the high factors are arrest history, drug use, and depression. Medium factors include age, living situation, employment, family background, and lack of religious influence. Low factors are gender and education. The high-risk factors are strong, so I'm leaning towards a YES prediction, but with medium confidence because some factors like education might help reduce the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is slightly above the higher risk younger age bracket but still within a medium risk range.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to male.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"Obesity may contribute to health issues but isn't a direct strong indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no marital ties can indicate lower social support, a medium risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college suggests some stability and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of multiple drugs is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental state\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of depression increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"medium\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area has mixed implications for risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may slightly increase risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
