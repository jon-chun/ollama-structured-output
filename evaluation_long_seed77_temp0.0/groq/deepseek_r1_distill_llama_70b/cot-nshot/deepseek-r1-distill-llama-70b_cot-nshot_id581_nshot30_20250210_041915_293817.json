    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old White female who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From the examples, younger males (like 18-20) had higher recidivism, but she's female and a bit older. I'm not sure how gender affects it, but maybe being female could lower the risk a bit. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. In the examples, people with more arrests, especially those convicted, were more likely to reoffend. Since she hasn't been convicted, that might reduce her risk. So arrest history is low.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't see a strong correlation between physical size and recidivism in the examples, so maybe this is a low factor.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Living alone was a factor in some cases, but not married might mean less stability. However, not living alone could mean she has support, which might lower risk. So maybe medium.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. In the examples, having a diploma or being enrolled sometimes correlated with lower recidivism. Not having a diploma or being enrolled might increase risk, so medium.\n\nShe's held 4 jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate higher risk, as stable employment often reduces recidivism. So maybe medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. Drug use was a significant factor in many examples, so not using drugs is a positive sign. Low risk here.\n\nShe's felt depressed some of the time. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments sometimes had higher recidivism, but living with a biological parent is stable. Maybe medium.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, reducing recidivism. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, she has some medium factors but also several low ones. Her lack of conviction and no drug use are positives. However, job instability and mental health are concerns. I think the positives outweigh the negatives, so I'll predict NO with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not in the highest risk demographic compared to younger individuals in the examples.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"Only one arrest and no conviction suggests lower risk compared to those with multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Not living alone might indicate some social support, which could reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college may indicate some stability but not as much as higher education.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in a year could indicate instability, which might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a positive indicator for lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down some of the time could indicate mental health issues that might increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with a biological mother in an urban area might have mixed effects on recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might provide a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
