    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White female who has been arrested once and convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. From the examples, I saw that younger individuals, especially those around 18-20, sometimes had higher recidivism, but 21 might be on the lower end. I'm not sure if age alone is a strong factor here.\n\nShe's female. Looking at the examples, most cases were males, but some females did have recidivism. However, being female might be a lower risk factor compared to males, as some studies suggest lower recidivism rates among women.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. In the examples, being married and living with a spouse seemed to correlate with lower recidivism. For instance, Example #21 was married and had a NO outcome. So this could be a protective factor, maybe medium or high in reducing risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a factor; having a diploma is better than not, but not continuing education might not be as protective as being enrolled. So maybe a medium risk here.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor. Having a job might reduce recidivism, but only having one job could indicate instability. So maybe medium risk.\n\nDrug use is marijuana in the past four years. Most examples with drug use, especially marijuana, sometimes led to YES outcomes, but not always. It's a common factor, so maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's felt depressed all the time in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk. This seems like a high risk factor because it can lead to poor decision-making or substance abuse.\n\nLiving with her biological mother at a young age in a household of size 5. Stable family environment might lower risk, so maybe low here.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her life. In some examples, this was a protective factor, associated with lower recidivism. So maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from depression, medium from job instability and drug use, and some protective factors from marriage and education. I think the prediction would be YES, but confidence isn't too high because there are conflicting factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is considered young but not significantly high risk compared to younger ages.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Being married and living with spouse can be a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job indicates some stability but could suggest instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can still pose a risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Persistent depression is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother suggests a stable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can be a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
