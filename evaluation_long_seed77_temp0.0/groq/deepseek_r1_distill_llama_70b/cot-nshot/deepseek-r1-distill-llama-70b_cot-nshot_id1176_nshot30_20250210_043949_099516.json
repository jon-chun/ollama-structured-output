    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher recidivism rates because they're still in a phase where they might make impulsive decisions. So I'll consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has been convicted. In the examples, multiple arrests and convictions often led to higher recidivism. For instance, Example #1 had one arrest and conviction leading to YES. So two arrests and a conviction might be a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 160 lbs. This seems average, so I don't think this is a significant risk factor. Probably low.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried at a young age might indicate less stability. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor. Lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism because it limits job opportunities. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Unstable employment can be a risk, but having at least one job might show some stability. Maybe medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. This is a positive sign, so low risk.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the time recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent could provide some support. Maybe medium.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, religious beliefs were a protective factor. So not having this might slightly increase risk, but it's probably low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are the number of arrests/convictions and lack of education. Medium factors include age, living situation, employment, and mental health. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not super confident because some factors like no drug use and living with mom might help. Maybe 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (18 years)\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in late adolescence, may have higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"Arrested 2 times and convicted\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism as it suggests prior involvement in criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"Height and weight (5'9\\\", 160 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Never married and living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate limited social support, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"No high school diploma or GED\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a significant risk factor as it limits employment opportunities and social mobility.\"),\n    (\"Held 1 job during the year\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment history can contribute to recidivism, though having some employment is a positive factor.\"),\n    (\"No drug use in past four years\", \"low\", \"Absence of drug use is a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Felt depressed some of the time\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues, if unaddressed, can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Lived with biological mother in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent can provide stability.\"),\n    (\"Does not consider God's influence\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may slightly increase risk, but it is not a strong predictor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
