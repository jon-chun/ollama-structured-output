    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. From the examples, younger males, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher recidivism rates because they're still in a phase where they might make impulsive decisions. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, seem to correlate with higher recidivism. For instance, Example #1 had one arrest and conviction leading to a YES. So three arrests and a conviction would be a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 215 lbs. In the examples, being taller or heavier didn't seem to directly correlate, but maybe in some cases, it could indicate physical presence or other issues. I'm not sure, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nLiving alone at 18 might indicate a lack of support system, which could be a risk. In the examples, living alone was common, but sometimes it was associated with higher risk. I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nHaving a GED is better than not having one, but not being enrolled in college might mean less stability. In some examples, education was a protective factor, so not having higher education could be a medium risk.\n\nHolding three jobs in a year suggests some instability or difficulty keeping a job, which could be a risk. Unstable employment is often linked to higher recidivism, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana, is present. Many examples with drug use had varying outcomes, but consistent use can be a risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNot feeling depressed is a positive factor. Depression was sometimes linked to higher risk, so not feeling depressed could lower the risk. I'll rate this as low.\n\nLiving with his biological dad in an urban area with a household size of six. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent could provide some stability. I'm not sure, so maybe medium.\n\nNot considering God's influence might reduce a protective factor, as some studies suggest religious beliefs can deter recidivism. So this could be a medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are the number of arrests and convictions. The medium factors include age, living alone, employment instability, drug use, and lack of religious influence. The low factors are physical build and mental state. The high factors are strong indicators, so I'm leaning towards a YES prediction, but not with the highest confidence because some factors are medium. Maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"18 years old, which is a formative and potentially impulsive phase of life.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held 3 jobs, suggesting possible instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use could indicate substance-related issues.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may reduce a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
