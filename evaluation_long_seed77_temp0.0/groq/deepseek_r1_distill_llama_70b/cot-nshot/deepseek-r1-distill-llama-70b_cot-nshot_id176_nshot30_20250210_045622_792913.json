    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. That's a lot of arrests and a conviction. In the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, often led to a higher risk. So this is probably a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'11\" and 165 lbs. That's quite tall and underweight. I'm not sure how much physical build impacts recidivism, but maybe being underweight could indicate other issues, but I don't see a strong correlation in the examples. So maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried is also common. I don't see a strong correlation either way, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor. Having a diploma is good, but not being enrolled might mean less structure. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Without a job, he might have less stability. So high risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was common in the examples, but it's not as severe as other drugs. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health can be a factor, but not feeling depressed might lower the risk. So low risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent could be stabilizing. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. In some examples, religious beliefs were present, but it's unclear how much it impacts recidivism. Maybe low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high arrest/conviction history and unemployment are big red flags. The rest are mixed. So I think the prediction is YES, but I'm not super confident because some factors like education and lack of depression might help. Maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is within a high-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"10 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but not as severe as other drugs.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common but not strongly correlated with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma is positive, but not being enrolled may lack structure.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression might lower risk.\"),\n    (\"living environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban area could have higher crime exposure but living with a parent is stabilizing.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is present but impact unclear.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
