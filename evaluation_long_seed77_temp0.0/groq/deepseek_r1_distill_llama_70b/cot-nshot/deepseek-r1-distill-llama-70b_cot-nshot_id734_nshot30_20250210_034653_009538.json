    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old White male and predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. From the examples, younger males, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, seem to have a higher risk. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has been convicted. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests, especially with a conviction, are strong indicators. Example #1 had one arrest and conviction leading to a YES. Example #7 had 10 arrests but no conviction and was a NO, but that's an outlier. So multiple arrests with a conviction is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 215 lbs. In the examples, weight didn't seem to be a major factor unless extreme. 215 lbs is on the heavier side but not drastically so. Maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. In the examples, living alone was common, but being unmarried might not be a big factor. Maybe low risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor. Having a diploma and being enrolled suggests he's trying to improve his situation, which could lower recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor. Examples like #4 and #15 had no jobs and were YES or NO, but unemployment is generally linked to higher recidivism. So high risk here.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, was present in many examples. It's a moderate risk factor because it's common but not as severe as harder drugs. Medium risk.\n\nHe's felt depressed some of the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism. Feeling down can lead to poor decision-making. Medium risk factor.\n\nLiving in a household of size 6 as a young age. Larger households might indicate instability or less supervision, which could be a risk. Medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence. In some examples, a lack of religious belief was linked to higher recidivism, like example #5 and #13. So maybe medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: high factors are multiple arrests and unemployment, medium factors include age, drug use, depression, household size, and lack of religious influence. Protective factors are education. So the prediction leans towards YES, but confidence isn't too high because of the education factor. Maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests and conviction\", \"high\", \"4 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"No jobs held during the year suggests instability and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a common factor but not as severe as other drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling depressed could contribute to poor decision-making.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Larger household may indicate less supervision or support.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence may correlate with higher recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
