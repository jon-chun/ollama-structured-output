    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times but hasn't been convicted. Multiple arrests without convictions could mean a few things. It might indicate that he's frequently engaging in risky behavior but hasn't been caught in more serious offenses, or perhaps he's had charges dropped each time. Either way, multiple arrests suggest ongoing issues, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'2\" and 140 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height. Maybe he's dealing with health issues or substance abuse, which could contribute to other risk factors. I'm not sure how much this directly impacts recidivism, but it might be a sign of other underlying problems, so I'll consider it low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can indicate a lack of social support, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to reoffend. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a significant risk factor because it limits job opportunities, which can lead to unemployment and increase the likelihood of criminal activity. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without a steady income, individuals might resort to illegal activities. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine, and has used them consistently in the past month. Drug use is a major risk factor because it can lead to criminal behavior to obtain drugs and can impair judgment. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's feeling down constantly for the past month. Depression or mental health issues can increase the likelihood of substance abuse and criminal behavior. This is a medium risk factor because while it's significant, it's a single aspect of his mental state.\n\nHe grew up in a household of four. Household size might not be as significant as other factors, but a larger household could indicate less individual attention or resources, which might contribute to behavioral issues. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community. So this might lower his risk, but I'm not sure how strong this effect is. I'll consider it a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors: multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. These are strong indicators for recidivism. The medium factors like age, living alone, and mental health issues add to the risk. The low factors like health, household size, and religion might slightly mitigate but not enough to outweigh the high-risk factors.\n\nSo, my prediction is YES, he's likely to be rearrested within three years. My confidence is around 85% because the high-risk factors are quite strong, but there's some uncertainty due to the mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests without convictions indicate frequent risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"health\", \"low\", \"Underweight may signal health issues but isn't a direct risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone suggests lack of social support, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use can lead to criminal behavior and impaired judgment.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase substance abuse and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Larger households may offer less individual attention but isn't a major factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide purpose and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
