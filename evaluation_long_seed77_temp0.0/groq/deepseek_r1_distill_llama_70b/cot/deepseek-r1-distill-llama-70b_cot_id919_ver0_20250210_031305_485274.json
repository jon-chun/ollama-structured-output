    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more influenced by peer pressure or impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that he was involved in some illegal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's unclear how serious the offense was. However, having an arrest on his record could still point to some level of involvement in risky behavior.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to recidivism. Unless there's something specific about his physical appearance that's linked to criminal behavior, which I don't think is the case here, so I might not consider this a significant factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can be factors. Being single and living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the risk of reoffending because he doesn't have a stable family environment to provide guidance or emotional support.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism. Without a diploma, his job opportunities are limited, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities as a means of income.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a protective factor because it provides structure and income. However, having had two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk if he's unable to secure steady work in the future.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's only marijuana, can be a risk factor. It might impair judgment and lead to further criminal behavior, especially if it's part of a larger substance abuse issue.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can play a role in recidivism, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might not be a significant factor. However, without knowing his longer-term mental health history, it's hard to say for sure.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of three in a rural area. A stable family environment with biological parents can be protective. Rural areas might have different challenges, like less access to resources or higher unemployment, which could influence behavior.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means he doesn't have a strong support system or moral framework, but this can vary widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors seem to be his young age, lack of education, employment instability, and drug use. These factors together might increase his likelihood of rearrest. However, he doesn't have a conviction history, which is a positive sign. His living situation and marital status are neutral to slightly negative. The absence of depression is a positive factor.\n\nSo, considering all these, I think his risk is medium. He has some concerning factors but also some protective ones. My confidence in this prediction is around 65% because while there are clear risk factors, the absence of a conviction and current stable mental health might mitigate some risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk due to developing decision-making skills and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"While indicating some involvement, the lack of conviction suggests less severity.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma limits job opportunities, increasing financial instability risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Job instability could lead to future difficulties in maintaining steady work.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use might impair judgment and lead to further issues.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No current depression, which is a positive factor.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective, despite rural challenges.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce support systems.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
