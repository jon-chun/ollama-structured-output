    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be going through formative years and could be more impulsive.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that he's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to a conviction. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that's risky.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 195 lbs. That's a bit above average but not excessively so. I don't think this is a significant risk factor on its own, but maybe in certain contexts, like if physical strength is related to the type of crime, it could play a role. But without knowing the nature of his arrests, it's hard to say. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability, but being single isn't necessarily a high-risk factor. Living alone might mean less social support, but again, not a major indicator on its own. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor. It suggests he has opportunities and is engaged in positive activities, which can reduce recidivism risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor. Frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it can still be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. However, since it's not specified as heavy use, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area with a household of five. A stable family background is a protective factor, reducing recidivism risk. Rural areas might have different dynamics, but overall, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are his young age and job instability, both medium. The rest are low. So the overall prediction is that he's not likely to be rearrested, with a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, he is in a higher risk age group for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"low\", \"Two arrests without conviction suggest some engagement with the legal system but not necessarily serious criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"His height and weight are slightly above average but not indicative of a specific risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Being single and living alone may indicate less social support but isn't a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and opportunity, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"job instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year could indicate instability, potentially increasing risk factors.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is common and not strongly indicative of high risk without heavier usage.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk related to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"A stable upbringing with both parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
