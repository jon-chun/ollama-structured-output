    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old Black female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher impulsivity, which can increase the risk of reoffending. But she's also in a 4-year college, which might indicate stability and lower risk.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction isn't too bad, but it does show some involvement with the law. I'll consider this a medium risk factor because it's not a repeat offense, but it's still a concern.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nLiving alone could mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase risk. However, she's in college, so maybe she's managing on her own but has the structure of school. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education is a protective factor, so this should lower her risk. I'll consider this low.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having only one job might indicate some instability. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll consider this low.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is low.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Stable family background is a protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. Her education and lack of recent drug use or mental health issues are positives. The conviction and living alone are concerns but not major. So, I predict low risk of rearrest with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 18, she is a young adult, which is a period of transition and potential vulnerability, but not inherently high risk.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"One arrest and conviction, which is a concern but not indicative of a pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held one job in the past year indicates some stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is less concerning than harder drugs, and there is no indication of current use.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression suggest better mental health stability.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household during youth is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
