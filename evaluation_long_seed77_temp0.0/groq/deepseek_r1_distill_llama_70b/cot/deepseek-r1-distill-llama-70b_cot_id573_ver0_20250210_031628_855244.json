    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more prone to impulsive decisions. However, she's just at the cusp of adulthood, so maybe her risk isn't too high here. I'll mark age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions. So, I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'9\" and 125-149 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to criminal behavior, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less supervision or support, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in a 4-year college. Education is a positive factor; it usually correlates with lower recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, but having only one job might indicate some instability. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a medium risk factor because job instability can sometimes lead to negative outcomes.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal activity. I'll mark this as high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since she's not feeling depressed now, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe lived with adoptive parents in a small household in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but a stable household might mitigate that. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the main high-risk factor is drug use. The rest are mostly low or medium. So, her overall prediction for rearrest is YES, but my confidence isn't too high because there are positive factors like education and employment. I'll set confidence at 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may be more prone to impulsive behavior, but being 18 is on the lower end of high-risk age groups.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction is a minimal indicator of criminal propensity.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not strongly correlated with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being unmarried and living alone is common at this age and not indicative of higher risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held one job in the past year may indicate some instability, but it's not a strong predictor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially with substances like cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of mental health-related issues leading to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with adoptive parents in a small household may have some influence but isn't a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief isn't a strong predictor of criminal behavior.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
