    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those just becoming adults, might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors. But she's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can provide structure and reduce idle time that might lead to criminal activity. So, I'm thinking age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction could indicate either a first-time offense or something that wasn't severe enough for a conviction. However, having an arrest on her record might suggest some level of involvement in risky behavior. I'm leaning towards medium here because it's a single arrest without a conviction, which isn't as severe as multiple arrests or convictions.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. It's more about physical characteristics, which don't directly relate to criminal behavior. So, low risk here.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone. Living with others, especially family, can provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Marriage isn't a factor here, but living situation seems stable, so low risk.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school. Education is a protective factor as it provides routine and opportunities. This should lower her risk, so low.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism by providing income and structure. Having two jobs might indicate responsibility, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing, can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior, either through substance-related crimes or impaired judgment. Marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, but still, it's a risk. I'd say medium here.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed. Depression can lead to poor decision-making or substance abuse as a coping mechanism. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in a rural area. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Rural areas might have less access to certain services, but overall, a stable upbringing is positive. So, low risk.\n\nShe doesn't consider God in her personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk if it means less social support, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, she has a mix of medium and low factors. The school enrollment and employment are strong positives. The drug use and mental health are concerns but not the highest. I think her overall risk is lower, so I'll predict NO with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 18, she is in a high-risk age group for impulsivity, but being enrolled in school may mitigate this risk.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests some risk but not a strong pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs indicates stability and responsibility, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, especially recent, could indicate substance-related risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to poor decision-making or substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone and having family support can reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school provides structure and reduces idle time that could lead to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support but is not a strong risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
