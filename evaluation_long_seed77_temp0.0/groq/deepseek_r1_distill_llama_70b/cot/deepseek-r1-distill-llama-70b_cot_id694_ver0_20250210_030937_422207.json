    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more influenced by peer pressure or impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. Each prior arrest increases the likelihood of future offenses, so this is a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 180 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, physical build alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism. It's more about behavior and other factors, so I'd rate this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence behavior. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could increase the risk, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, increasing the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior. This is a medium risk.\n\nHe's held seven jobs in a year. Job instability is a red flag. It suggests he might have issues with commitment, impulse control, or could be using illegal activities as a means of income. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism. Drugs can lead to impaired judgment and can be linked to criminal activities to support a habit. This is high risk.\n\nHe's felt down in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the risk of recidivism if left untreated. It can lead to poor decision-making and substance abuse. This is a medium risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, but urban areas might have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences. However, since he did live with both parents, this might mitigate some risks, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism, but it's not as strong as other factors. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are prior convictions, job instability, and drug use. Medium risks include living alone, limited education, and mental health issues. The rest are low. Considering all these, the prediction leans towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while there are strong indicators, there's still a chance for intervention and change.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical build alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision and support, potentially increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities and increase criminal behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes suggest potential issues with commitment or impulse control.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"Drug use can impair judgment and lead to criminal activities for income.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Untreated mental health issues can lead to poor decisions and substance abuse.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment mitigates some urban crime exposure risks.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation is a weaker risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
