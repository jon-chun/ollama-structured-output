    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female to predict her 3-year rearrest recidivism. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can provide structure and reduce idle time that might lead to criminal activity. So, I'm thinking age might be a medium risk factor because while young, her enrollment could mitigate some risks.\n\nNext, she's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions. It could indicate a one-time mistake rather than a pattern. So, I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nShe's living alone. Living alone at 18 might mean she has less supervision, which could increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors. On the other hand, it might also mean she's more independent and responsible. I'm leaning towards medium risk here because the lack of supervision could be a factor, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is generally a stabilizing factor. Having two jobs shows she's capable of maintaining employment, which can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can be a risk factor for recidivism. It can impair judgment and lead to associations with higher-risk individuals. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so I'd rate this as medium risk.\n\nShe sometimes feels down and unable to be cheered up. This indicates possible mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase the risk of engaging in criminal behavior, especially if she's self-medicating with drugs. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in a household of six. A larger household might indicate less individual attention or more stress, which can contribute to behavioral issues. However, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior, so I'd consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are protective factors against recidivism. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are mixed. She has some positive factors like education and employment, which lower her risk, but also some concerning factors like drug use and mental health issues. However, the positive factors might outweigh the negatives, leading me to predict a lower likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 65% because while there are some risks, the protective factors are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity but being enrolled in school provides structure.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests a possible one-time mistake.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could reduce supervision but may also indicate responsibility.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs shows stability and reduces criminal likelihood.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can impair judgment and associate with higher-risk individuals.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase criminal behavior risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Larger household may mean less attention but isn't a direct criminal indicator.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs provide purpose and community, reducing risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
