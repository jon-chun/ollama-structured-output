    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. That could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nHe's male, and statistically, males have a higher recidivism rate than females. That might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or convictions, so maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. Probably low.\n\nHe's never been married and not living alone. Living with others might provide some stability, but not being married could mean less social integration. Maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to recidivism, so that's probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. That's positive, so low risk factors for substance abuse and mental health.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a rural area. Stable family environment could be protective, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is lack of education, medium is employment instability and being male, and the rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is low for rearrest, but I'm about 65% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 20 years old, while young, this is not considered a high-risk age bracket for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Being male is associated with a higher likelihood of recidivism compared to female counterparts.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year indicates instability, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental stability.\"),\n    (\"family environment\", \"low\", \"Living with biological father in a stable household is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
