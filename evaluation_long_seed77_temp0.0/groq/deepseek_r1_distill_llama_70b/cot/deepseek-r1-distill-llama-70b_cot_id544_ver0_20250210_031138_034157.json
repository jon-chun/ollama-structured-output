    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This suggests he might not be deterred by legal consequences, so this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 215 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, by itself, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So, I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and social support, which are protective against recidivism. Without these, he might be at higher risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism by providing better job opportunities. Not pursuing higher education might limit his options, so this is a medium-risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism. Unstable employment can lead to financial stress, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. So, this is medium risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be linked to criminal behavior, either through substance-related crimes or impaired judgment. This is a medium-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not currently depressed, this might be a protective factor. So, I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which is a risk factor. So, this is medium.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might increase recidivism risk. I'll consider this a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high and medium-risk factors. His young age, criminal history, unstable employment, and living situation are significant concerns. However, the absence of current mental health issues and drug use might slightly mitigate the risk. Overall, I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest, so the prediction is YES with a confidence level around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Held three jobs in a year, suggesting potential issues with maintaining stable employment.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without a spouse may indicate lack of stable social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not enrolled in college might limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years could indicate ongoing substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, which might reduce immediate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight alone aren't direct indicators of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce social support networks.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
