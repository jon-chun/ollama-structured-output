    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that he's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to a conviction. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that's risky. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some involvement with the legal system, but without convictions, it's not as severe.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 255 lbs. While this might make him stand out, I don't see a direct correlation between physical size and recidivism. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of social support. This could be a medium risk factor because without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to reoffend.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is a big factor in recidivism. Without a diploma, his employment opportunities are limited, which can lead to higher chances of reoffending. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Not having consistent work can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to criminal activity. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it some times in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, is a significant risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the likelihood of recidivism if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor because it indicates potential emotional instability.\n\nHe grew up in a household of nine in an urban area. Large household sizes can sometimes indicate overcrowding or less individual attention, which might contribute to behavioral issues. Urban areas might also have higher crime rates and less access to resources. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support and different coping mechanisms, which might increase recidivism risk. I'll rate this as low because the impact might be less direct compared to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education level, employment stability, and drug use. Medium factors include age, arrests without conviction, living alone, mental health, and upbringing. Low factors are physical size and religious beliefs. The combination of multiple high and medium factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. Therefore, the prediction is YES, and considering the number of high-risk factors, my confidence is around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral issues, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between size and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Limited education reduces employment opportunities, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Ongoing drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal involvement risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can contribute to emotional instability and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Large household and urban environment may contribute to behavioral challenges.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support but has a lesser impact.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
