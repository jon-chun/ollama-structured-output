    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or have less stable life structures. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests, but it still indicates some level of involvement with the law. I think this is a low risk factor because it's just one incident without a conviction.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor. It's more about physical appearance, which isn't a strong indicator for recidivism.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 21 is pretty common. I'm not sure how significant this is, so maybe a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. I'll rate this as medium because it's a neutral factor but could influence his future stability.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate issues with employment, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of reoffending. So I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it can still be a risk factor depending on frequency and impact on behavior. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but since he had a stable home, it's probably not a high risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The medium factors like age, job instability, and drug use are present but not overwhelmingly high. So I think the overall prediction is a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, individuals are often in a transitional phase and may be at higher risk for impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year indicates potential instability which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can still influence behavior and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common at this age and doesn't strongly indicate risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological mother is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
