    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while she's an adult, her youth might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not an extensive history. I'd rate this as medium because while it's not negligible, it's also not a long record.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'4\" and 272 lbs. While being overweight can have health implications, I don't see a direct link to criminal behavior. So, this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor. However, not being married at 21 isn't unusual, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor. Pursuing further education suggests she's trying to improve her situation, which could lower her risk. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might indicate financial instability or issues with commitment. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nShe's been feeling down most of the past month. Depression or low mood can increase the likelihood of substance abuse or other risky behaviors. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a large household as a child. A stable family structure with biological parents is generally a protective factor, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors include age, employment instability, mental health, and criminal history. The low factors are her education, living situation, family background, and lack of religious belief. \n\nConsidering all these, the high drug use and medium factors like young age and unstable employment might push the prediction towards a higher risk. However, her educational pursuits are a positive sign. I'm leaning towards predicting YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are mitigating factors like education. So, I'll set confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may be more prone to impulsive behavior, contributing to a medium risk factor.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system, posing a medium risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding only one job in the past year suggests potential instability, a medium risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including cocaine, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down consistently could indicate underlying issues that might increase risky behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Pursuing education is a protective factor, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 21 is common and doesn't strongly indicate risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"A stable household with biological parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation isn't a strong risk indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
