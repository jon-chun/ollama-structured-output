    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that might lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's female. I remember that, on average, women tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to men. So her gender might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but not serious enough for a conviction. This might indicate some involvement in minor offenses, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might provide more stability and less isolation, which can be a protective factor. So this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities. I'll rate this as low.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism by providing structure and income. Having only one job might indicate some instability, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can increase the likelihood of recidivism. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a small household. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, she has a mix of medium and low risk factors. Her age and employment instability are concerns, but her education and stable living situation are positives. I think the prediction is NO, and my confidence is around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest some criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide stability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religion can reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
