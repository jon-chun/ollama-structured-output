    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's significant because a history of multiple arrests and a conviction indicates a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This makes me think his criminal history is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. It doesn't really contribute to recidivism, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of support, which could be a risk. But it's not the strongest factor, so I'll rate it medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor because it can lead to better job opportunities and stability. However, he's held three jobs in the past year, which might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. The job instability is a concern, so I'll rate employment history as medium.\n\nDrug use is a big one. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has used them recently. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's experienced some depression recently, feeling down for periods. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism if not properly addressed, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHis upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment is a protective factor, so I'll mark family environment as low.\n\nHe has a religious belief, which can provide support and reduce recidivism. So, religious beliefs are a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are criminal history and drug use. The medium factors include age, living situation, employment history, and mental health. The low factors are physical build, education, family environment, and religion. \n\nConsidering all these, the high risk factors are significant enough that I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. So, the prediction is YES, and my confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some protective elements like education and family background that might mitigate the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests better stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year may indicate instability, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, including marijuana and cocaine, is a strong predictor of recidivism due to potential ongoing addiction and related behaviors.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to recidivism if not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
