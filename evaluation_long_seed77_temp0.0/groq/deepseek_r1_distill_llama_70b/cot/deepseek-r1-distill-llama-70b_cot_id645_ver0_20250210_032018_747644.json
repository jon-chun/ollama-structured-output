    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or have less stable life structures. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests, but it still indicates some level of involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows he's had a brush with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHis physical build is 5'9\" and 155 lbs, which is average. I don't see this as a significant factor either way, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that could be a medium risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. I'm considering this a medium risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk. So, medium risk here.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it some times in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, is a known risk factor for recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor because substance use can lead to impaired judgment and legal issues.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is significant, but there are several medium factors that could either increase or be mitigated by protective factors like education and religious beliefs. The prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are both risk and protective factors at play. I'll set confidence at 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age bracket for recidivism as individuals in early 20s may still be in a phase of experimentation or instability.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the law but lacks the severity of multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs suggests some employment history, but frequent job changes could indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to legal issues.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down could indicate underlying mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
