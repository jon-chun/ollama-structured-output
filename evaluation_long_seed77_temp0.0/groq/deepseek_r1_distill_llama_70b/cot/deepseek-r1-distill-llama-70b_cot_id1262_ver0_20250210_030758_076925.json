    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor because it shows some past issues but not a strong criminal history.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. Physical build isn't a strong indicator of recidivism, so that's low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes indicate stability, but living alone at 21 isn't uncommon. However, living alone might mean less social support, which could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism, so having a diploma is good. Not being in college might limit his opportunities, but it's not a strong risk factor on its own. I'd say low.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor because it provides stability and income. Having two jobs shows he's employable and responsible, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a big positive. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so his abstinence lowers his risk. Definitely low here.\n\nNo recent depression is good. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in an urban area. Stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but without more context, it's not a major factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can vary, but some studies suggest that religious involvement can reduce recidivism. However, this isn't a strong factor, so I'll rate it low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk. His age is the only medium factor. Since he has stable employment, education, and no substance abuse, I predict he won't be rearrested. My confidence is around 80% because while the factors look good, age and living alone could still pose some risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, he is in a higher risk age group for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests some involvement with the law but lacks the severity of a criminal record.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"low\", \"Being single and living alone may indicate less social support, but is not strongly indicative of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not being in college may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates stability and responsibility, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years is a strong protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological father in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may not strongly impact recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
