    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a moderate risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to a conviction. This could be a medium risk factor because repeated arrests suggest some level of involvement in activities that attract police attention, even if not leading to convictions.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 134 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical attributes aren't strong predictors. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Being unmarried and living with others might mean she has a support system, which could be a protective factor. However, if she's living with others who might have their own issues, it could go either way. I think this is a low risk factor because the presence of others might provide some stability.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could increase the likelihood of recidivism due to fewer job options. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. Unstable employment can be a risk factor for recidivism, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years. This is a positive sign. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so not using drugs lowers her risk. This is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed. Feeling down could indicate underlying issues that might lead to negative coping mechanisms. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size four when young. A stable family environment can be protective, so this might lower her risk. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, but it's not a strong predictor. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, she has a mix of medium and low risk factors. The lack of drug use and stable family background are positives, but her age, employment instability, and mental health concerns are negatives. I think the overall prediction leans towards a lower risk, so I'll predict \"NO\" with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Repeated arrests suggest potential ongoing issues.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Limited job history may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"mental health concerns\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could affect behavior.\"),\n    (\"lack of drug use\", \"low\", \"Not using drugs reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"stable family background\", \"low\", \"Supportive upbringing is protective.\"),\n    (\"no religious affiliation\", \"low\", \"Less social support but not a strong factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
