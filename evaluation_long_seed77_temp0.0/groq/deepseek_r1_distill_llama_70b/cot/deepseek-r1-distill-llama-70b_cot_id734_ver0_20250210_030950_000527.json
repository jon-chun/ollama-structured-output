    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So, I'd consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's significant. Multiple arrests, especially leading to a conviction, indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This makes me think his criminal history is a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 215 lbs. While this might make him stand out, I don't see a direct correlation between physical size and recidivism. So, I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of support, which could be a medium risk factor. However, it's not as strong as other factors, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor because it can lead to better job opportunities and stability. However, he hasn't held any jobs in the past year, which is a red flag. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism, so I'll rate this as high.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, but since it's not a harder drug, maybe medium. The depression symptoms could also contribute to impulsivity or further drug use, so that's another medium factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of six could mean less individual attention or resources, which might contribute to behavioral issues. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower social support, but this can vary. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are criminal history and unemployment. Medium factors include age, living alone, drug use, mental health, and household size. Low factors are physical build and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, and my confidence is around 75% because there are strong factors pointing towards a higher risk, but there are also some positive elements like education that might mitigate it a bit.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between size and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support system.\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment despite education is a strong risk factor.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression could contribute to impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Large household may have contributed to behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation has minimal impact.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
