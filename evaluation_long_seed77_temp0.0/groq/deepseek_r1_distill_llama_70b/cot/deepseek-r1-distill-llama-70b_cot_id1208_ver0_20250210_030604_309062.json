    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more influenced by peer pressure or impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction is a significant risk factor because it indicates that he's already engaged in criminal behavior and might be more likely to continue down that path. However, since it's only one conviction, it's not as high as someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence recidivism. Being unmarried and living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the risk, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated, might contribute to recidivism. Both of these are medium risk factors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and reducing recidivism. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his young age and lack of education. The medium factors include prior conviction, living alone, job instability, drug use, mental health, and urban upbringing. The low factors are his belief in God and physical build. \n\nConsidering all these, his risk is on the higher side, so I predict a YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some protective elements like his belief and having held jobs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior conviction indicates past criminal behavior and a higher likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding multiple jobs may indicate instability, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior likelihood.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate untreated mental health issues, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments often have higher crime exposure, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
