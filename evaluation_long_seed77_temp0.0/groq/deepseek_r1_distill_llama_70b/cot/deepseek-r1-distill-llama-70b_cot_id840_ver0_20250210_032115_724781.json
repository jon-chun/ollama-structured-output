    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that she's had run-ins with the law, but maybe the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty. This could suggest some involvement in risky behavior, but without convictions, it's a bit unclear. I might rate this as medium because it shows some engagement with the legal system, but not necessarily a strong pattern yet.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I can probably ignore those factors.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others might provide some stability, but if she's in an unstable environment, that could be a risk. However, without more info on her living situation, it's hard to say. Maybe this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit her opportunities. This could be a low risk factor because she has the foundation, but not the advanced education that might offer more stability.\n\nShe's held seven jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which might relate to impulsivity or unreliable behavior. This could be a medium risk factor because frequent job changes might suggest she's struggling to maintain steady employment, which could lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity.\n\nShe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and engagement in risky behaviors. Recent use, especially with harder drugs like cocaine, is a red flag. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nShe's experienced depression, feeling down for periods over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, especially if they're untreated. This could be a medium risk factor because it might impair her judgment or lead to self-medication with drugs.\n\nHer upbringing was with her biological mother in a large household in a rural area. Rural areas might have different challenges, like less access to resources, but I'm not sure how significant this is. It might be a low risk factor unless there were specific issues related to her upbringing.\n\nShe doesn't consider God's influence in her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but it's not a strong indicator one way or the other. I might consider this a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are drug use and maybe the number of arrests. The medium factors include job instability and mental health. The rest are low. So, her overall risk is probably medium. I'm about 65% confident in this assessment because while there are some concerning factors, there are also mitigating ones like her education and lack of convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 18, she is in a transitional phase but not necessarily high risk solely based on age.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Three arrests without convictions indicate some legal involvement but not a strong pattern of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Seven jobs in a year suggests instability, which could indicate issues with reliability or impulse control.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and cocaine, especially recent use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to impaired judgment or substance use.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone might provide some stability, though specifics of her environment are unclear.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living in a rural area with biological mother in a large household has unclear impact without specific issues.\"),\n    (\"religious views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence is not a strong indicator of risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
