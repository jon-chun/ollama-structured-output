    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger offenders are generally at a higher risk because they might not have fully developed impulse control and might be more influenced by peers. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some criminal history, but since it's only one, it's not a very extensive record. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Unless there's something specific about his physical appearance that's linked to criminal behavior, which I don't see, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less supervision and more freedom to engage in risky behaviors without someone to check in. That might contribute to higher risk, so medium.\n\nHe's enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can provide structure and reduce idle time that might lead to criminal activity. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHaving held two jobs in the past year suggests some stability and responsibility, which is another positive sign. Employment can reduce the likelihood of recidivism, so low risk.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. Using marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, especially with recent use, can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior. This is a high risk factor.\n\nFeeling down for most of the past month indicates possible mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase recidivism risk, so high.\n\nLiving in a rural area with a large household as a child might have limited resources or support, which can contribute to higher risk. Medium.\n\nNot considering God's influence might relate to a lack of social or moral support structures, which could increase risk. Medium.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, drug use, and mental health. Medium factors include living situation, rural upbringing, and lack of religious influence. Low factors are physical build, education, and employment. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong indicators, there are also positive factors like education and employment that might mitigate some risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some criminal history but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"No specific risk indicated by height and weight.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Less supervision and more freedom could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school provides structure and reduces idle time.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having jobs suggests stability and responsibility.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Large household in rural area may have limited resources.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious influence might reduce moral support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
