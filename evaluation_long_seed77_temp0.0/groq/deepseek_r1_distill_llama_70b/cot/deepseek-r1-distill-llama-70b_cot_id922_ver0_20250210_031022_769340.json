    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's an adult now, so I'm not sure if age alone is a high risk factor. Maybe medium.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males, so that might be a lower risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but no formal charges stuck. This might indicate some involvement in risky behavior, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism, so I can probably ignore those.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. So that's probably a low risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or due to fewer opportunities. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might increase the risk of recidivism. Maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be a risk factor for recidivism, as it can lead to further legal issues or associate with criminal activities. That's probably a medium risk.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, as they might lead to self-medication or other risky behaviors. So that's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a large household in a rural area. Rural areas might have less access to resources, but living with a biological parent could be stabilizing. Maybe low risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are lack of education and maybe job instability. The rest are medium or low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 18, she is young and may still be developing impulse control, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction indicate some engagement with the justice system but no formal charges.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with her spouse provides stability and support, reducing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and may increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years may indicate substance use issues that could elevate risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to higher risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with her biological mother in a rural area may provide some stability despite household size.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a support system and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
