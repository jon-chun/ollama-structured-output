    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but since she's just entering adulthood, I'm not sure if it's high or medium. I'll lean towards medium because youth can be a risk, but it's not the highest.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor because it's a single arrest without a conviction outcome.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. Maybe low risk because it doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone. Living with others might provide more stability, which could be a protective factor. So, this might be a low risk factor because living with others can reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor, so having a diploma is good. Not being in college might limit her opportunities, but it's not a strong risk factor. I'll consider this low.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate some instability. I'm not sure, but maybe medium risk because job instability can contribute to recidivism.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a known risk factor for recidivism. However, since it's not specified as current use, it's a moderate risk. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nShe didn't feel depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, so not feeling depressed is a protective factor. Low risk here.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults at a young age in a large household. Unstable living conditions can increase risk, so this is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a support system and moral framework. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The medium factors are age, prior arrest, job instability, drug use, and living situation. However, she has several protective factors like education, employment, and religious beliefs. I think the overall prediction is NO, she won't be rearrested, with about 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to risk.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction is less severe.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability can indicate higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Unstable early living conditions can increase risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
