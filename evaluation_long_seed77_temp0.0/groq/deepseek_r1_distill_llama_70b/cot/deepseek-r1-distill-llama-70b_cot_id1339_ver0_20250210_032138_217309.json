    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while he's not a juvenile anymore, he's still relatively young.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low because it's a single arrest without a proven offense.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't think this contributes much to recidivism risk, so low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Being unmarried and living with others could mean less stability or more exposure to environments that might lead to criminal behavior. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, which could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate financial stress or inability to maintain employment, which could lead to criminal activity. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism, especially if untreated. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of six could indicate economic stress or less individual attention, which might contribute to behavioral issues. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community, which might reduce recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a big concern. The medium factors like young age, job instability, mental health, and household size add up. The protective factors like education and spirituality help, but the high drug use is significant. I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, and my confidence is around 75% because while there are several risk factors, there are also some protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but not a proven offense.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may suggest financial instability, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Cocaine use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to criminal activity to support the habit.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to increased risk if left untreated.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household may indicate economic stress or less individual attention, potentially contributing to behavioral issues.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
