    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it still indicates some involvement in criminal activity. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Unless there's a specific reason, like if he's very large and might intimidate others, but 6'3\" and 170 lbs is tall but not overly heavy. I don't see this as a significant risk factor, so low.\n\nHe's married but living alone. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, but living alone might mean less social support or supervision. This could be a low risk factor because the stabilizing effect of marriage might outweigh the solitude.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and financial instability, which are known risk factors for recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor, so not using drugs lowers his risk. That's a low risk factor.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is good, but mental health can fluctuate. However, without recent issues, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but his stable upbringing might mitigate that.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk if it means less community support, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is unemployment/education, medium factors are age and criminal history, and the rest are low. The high factor is significant, but the others might balance it out. I think the overall prediction is a medium risk, so a 60% confidence in rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicates some criminal involvement, but not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment and lack of education can lead to financial instability and idle time, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both biological parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental stability.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Marriage can be stabilizing, though living alone may reduce social support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
