    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but not necessarily found guilty. However, multiple arrests could suggest a pattern of behavior that's concerning. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows some engagement with the justice system, but without convictions, it's not as severe.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'0\" and 285 lbs. While this might make him stand out, by itself, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. Not being married at 20 isn't unusual, but combined with living alone, it might contribute to isolation. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities and stability, which are protective against recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which increases the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This is another high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it some times in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can be linked to higher recidivism rates. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I might rate this as medium.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a stable family environment is a protective factor, so this would be low risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education and employment. Medium factors include age, arrests, living alone, drug use, and mental health. Low factors are physical size, family background, and religion. The high factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and less life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential behavioral issues, though lack of convictions may indicate other factors.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone isn't a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of strong social support can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma limits opportunities and stability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment leads to financial instability, raising recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Ongoing marijuana use is linked to higher recidivism, though less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide purpose and community support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
