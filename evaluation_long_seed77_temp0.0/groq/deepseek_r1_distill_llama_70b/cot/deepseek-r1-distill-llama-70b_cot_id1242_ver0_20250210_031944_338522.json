    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows he's had legal issues before, but it's not extensive.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant risk factor. Physical build isn't a strong indicator of recidivism, so that's low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living alone can sometimes indicate stability, so not having these might suggest a lack of stable social support. I'll consider this a medium risk factor because social stability can influence recidivism.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities and lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent use, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of reoffending. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I might rate this as medium. But considering he's used it recently, maybe it's high. Hmm, I think I'll go with medium because it's not specified as heavy or problematic use beyond marijuana.\n\nHe's been feeling down most of the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk if untreated. This lack of mental well-being can lead to poor decision-making. I'll rate this as high.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five with his biological mother in a rural area. Larger households might have more stress or less individual attention, but rural areas can have different challenges. I'm not sure how significant this is, so maybe low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower social support, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education level, unemployment, and mental health. Medium factors include age, criminal history, living situation, and drug use. Low factors are physical build, household background, and religious beliefs. \n\nWith multiple high and medium factors, especially the strong indicators like unemployment and lack of education, I'm leaning towards a higher risk of recidivism. So the prediction is YES, and my confidence is around 85% because several significant factors are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, he is in a high-risk age group for recidivism, as young adults are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Having been arrested once and convicted indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it is not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years may indicate substance use issues, which can contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for most of the past month could indicate untreated mental health issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
