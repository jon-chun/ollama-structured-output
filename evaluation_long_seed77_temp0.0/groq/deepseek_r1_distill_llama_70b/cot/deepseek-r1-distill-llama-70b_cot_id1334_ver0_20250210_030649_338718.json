    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign. Education can provide structure and reduce idle time that might lead to criminal activity. So, I'm thinking age might be a medium risk factor because while young, her enrollment could mitigate some risks.\n\nNext, she's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions. It could have been a one-time mistake or a minor offense. So, I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5'0\" and 130 lbs. I don't see this as a significant factor. Physical size doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate independence, but it could also mean less social support. However, without more context on her living situation, I'm not sure. Maybe a low risk factor here.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school. Education is a protective factor as it provides routine and can lead to better opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can provide stability and reduce the need for criminal activities. Having a job, even if it's just one, is a positive sign. So, low risk here as well.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common and not as severe as harder drugs. However, any drug use can be a risk factor for recidivism, so I'd rate this as medium risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she hasn't felt depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area with a household size of five. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a larger household might indicate less individual attention, but living with her biological mother is a stable family structure. So, maybe a low risk factor here.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with lower social support, but it's not a strong indicator. I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low risk, with a couple of medium ones. Her age and drug use are the main concerns, but her enrollment in school and employment are positives. So, I think the overall prediction is low for rearrest, with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity but being enrolled in school provides structure.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests a lower risk.\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may indicate independence without clear negative impact.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having a job provides stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a moderate risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family structure with biological mother.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation isn't a strong indicator.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
