    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be going through formative years and may not have fully developed impulse control. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as high risk as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows he's had legal issues before, but it's not a repeated pattern yet.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 198 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but I don't see how that directly relates to criminal behavior. Maybe in some contexts, but overall, I don't think this is a significant risk factor. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 21 is pretty common. I'm not sure how much this contributes, so maybe low risk here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, which should lower his risk. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having only one job might indicate some instability or difficulty in maintaining employment. I'm not sure, but maybe this is a medium risk because job instability can lead to financial stress, which might increase recidivism risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can be a risk factor. It can lead to impaired judgment and potential involvement in criminal activities. So I'll consider this a medium risk.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the likelihood of recidivism if not addressed. This is probably a medium risk factor because untreated mental health issues can lead to negative coping mechanisms.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a small household in a rural area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this might lower his risk. Rural areas might have different challenges, but overall, this seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor. So this is a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are a mix of low, medium, and a couple of medium. The protective factors like education and religious beliefs are positives. However, the presence of drug use, mental health issues, and some employment instability are negatives. I think the overall prediction is that he might reoffend, but I'm not very confident because there are strong protective factors. So I'll say a 60% confidence in a YES prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicates some criminal involvement but not a repeated pattern.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year may indicate instability, which could contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, especially recent, can impair judgment and increase criminal involvement risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unaddressed issues that might increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with criminal behavior, thus minimal risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common at this age and doesn't strongly indicate risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in college is a protective factor, reducing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological mother is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
