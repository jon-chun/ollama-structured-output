    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's female. I remember that, on average, women tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to men. So her gender might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and has a conviction. A single arrest and conviction could indicate a medium risk because it shows she's had contact with the law, but it's not a repeated offense, so it's not as high as someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem directly relevant to recidivism, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a medium risk factor. Marriage and living with others can sometimes provide stability, so not having that might increase the risk slightly.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can be a barrier to employment, which might increase the likelihood of recidivism. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. So this is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe it's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been feeling down most of the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the risk of recidivism if not addressed. This is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nShe lived with her biological dad in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are medium risks, but there are a couple of low ones. The prediction would lean towards a higher chance of rearrest, so I'll say YES. My confidence is around 75% because while there are several medium factors, there are no extremely high-risk elements like multiple convictions or hard drug use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Women generally have lower recidivism rates than men.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicate some criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED without college enrollment can limit employment opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may signal instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may expose individuals to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
