    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old individual to predict the likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while youth can correlate with higher recidivism, it's not the highest on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests, especially leading to a conviction, indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This seems like a high risk factor because prior offenses are a strong predictor of future behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. It doesn't really contribute to recidivism, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of stable social support, which can be a risk factor. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to reoffend. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment and lack of education beyond high school can limit opportunities, leading to higher recidivism. This is a high risk factor because without stable employment or further education, the likelihood of returning to criminal behavior increases.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has experienced depression. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, though maybe not as high as harder drugs. However, combined with feelings of depression, this could indicate unaddressed issues that might lead to further criminal activity. I'll rate this as medium because while it's a concern, it's not the most severe.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of eight in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less access to resources, which might contribute to recidivism. Living in a crowded household could also lead to instability. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his criminal history and unemployment/education status. The medium factors include age, living situation, substance use, and upbringing. The low factor is his physical build. Considering all these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, and I'm about 80% confident because there are multiple significant risk factors present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested three times and convicted indicates a pattern of behavior that is concerning and predictive of future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"high\", \"Having a high school diploma but no college enrollment and no jobs in the past year can limit opportunities and increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years and recent feelings of depression could indicate unaddressed issues that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household in an urban area may have exposed him to environments or situations that could increase the risk of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
