    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old woman based on the given information. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. Four arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending. However, it's not an extremely high number, so maybe medium risk here as well.\n\nHer height and weight are 4'11\" and 110 lbs. I'm not sure how much physical stature plays into recidivism, but maybe being smaller could be a factor in certain types of crimes, but I don't think it's a major risk factor. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married might indicate less social stability, which could be a risk factor. Living with others might provide some support, but if she's not married, maybe she's less settled. I think this is a medium risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit her opportunities, so maybe medium risk here.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism risk because it provides stability. Having two jobs might show she's trying, but maybe it's not very stable. I'm thinking medium risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are positive factors. Substance abuse is a big risk for recidivism, so not using drugs is a good sign. Mental health stability also helps, so both of these should be low risk factors.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this should be low risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but her family stability probably outweighs that.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are medium, but some are low. The prediction is probably NO because there are more protective factors, but I'm not super confident. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age group for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Four arrests indicate some criminal history but not an extensive one.\"),\n    (\"physical_stature\", \"low\", \"Small stature may not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Not being married could indicate less social stability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not attending college might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs shows some stability but may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
