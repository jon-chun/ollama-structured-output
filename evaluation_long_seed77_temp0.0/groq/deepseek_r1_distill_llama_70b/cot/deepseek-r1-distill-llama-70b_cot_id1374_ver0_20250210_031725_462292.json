    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more prone to impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that this was a first-time offense or a less severe crime. However, having an arrest on record could still point to some level of involvement in risky behavior, so this is a moderate risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor here. It doesn't really influence recidivism one way or the other.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of reoffending because he doesn't have a strong support system to guide him away from negative behaviors. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so not having that could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not continuing education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to unemployment or underemployment, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism. Not having consistent work can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to engage in criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to dependency, which in turn can drive criminal behavior to obtain drugs. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not experiencing depression now, that's a lower risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area with a household of six. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Growing up in a rural area might have different influences, but overall, having both parents around is a positive. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor because it might mean less involvement in community support structures that religion can provide. However, this can vary, so I'd rate this as a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are unstable employment and drug use. Medium factors include living alone, limited education, and prior arrest. The lower factors are age, family background, and lack of religious belief. The mental health is a lower risk since he's not currently depressed.\n\nConsidering all these, the high risk factors are significant enough to push the prediction towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, the presence of some protective factors like a stable family background and having a high school diploma might mitigate the risk a bit. So, I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are both high and medium factors balancing out the lower ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest indicates potential involvement in risky behavior, though without conviction it's moderate.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support may increase risk without a stable support system.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a diploma is protective, but not continuing education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for dependency and related criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment with both parents is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce community support, but impact varies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
