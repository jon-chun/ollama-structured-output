    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old Black female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some level of involvement with the criminal justice system, but since it's only one arrest, it's not a very extensive history. I think this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor. However, not being married at 18 is common, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might increase the likelihood of recidivism. So, I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, but since it's not a harder drug, maybe it's medium. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. So, I'll go with medium for substance use.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of size four at a young age. Stable family environment can be protective, so this might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are age and lack of education. Medium factors include prior conviction, living alone, job instability, and substance use. Low factors are physical attributes, family background, and religious beliefs. \n\nThe high-risk factors are significant, but there are also some protective factors. So, I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because of the mitigating factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may signal instability.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious support can reduce recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
