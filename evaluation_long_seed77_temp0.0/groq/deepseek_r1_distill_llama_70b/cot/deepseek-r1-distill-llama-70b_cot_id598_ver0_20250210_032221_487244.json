    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some level of criminal involvement, but since it's only one arrest, it's not an extensive history. I think this is a medium risk factor because while it's a concern, it's not multiple offenses.\n\nHis living situation is alone, which might mean less supervision or support. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there's a lack of positive influences. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, possibly leading to higher risk. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Employment instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate financial instability or a lack of structure. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not experiencing depression now, this might lower his risk. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHis family background is stable; he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't consider religion important. Some studies suggest that religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, so not having this might slightly increase risk, but it's probably a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and drug use. The medium factors include prior conviction, living alone, education, and employment. The low factors are mental health, family background, and religion. The presence of two high-risk factors and several medium ones suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. However, the stable family background and lack of current mental health issues might mitigate some risk. I'm about 80% confident in this assessment, so the prediction is YES with 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision and positive influences, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"One job in the past year suggests possible instability or lack of structure.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism due to impaired judgment and potential criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk related to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"A stable family environment is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious beliefs may slightly increase risk but is a minor factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
