    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'8\" and 145 lbs. That's quite tall and underweight. While height might make him more noticeable, being underweight could indicate possible health issues or a lack of stability, which might contribute to higher risk. I'm leaning towards medium here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone can mean less social support, which is a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so this is a medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to more criminal activity. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism, but having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which could be a risk. I'm considering this a medium risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if not current, can be a risk factor, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as low.\n\nNo recent depression. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size four at a young age. Stable family environment can be protective, so this is a low risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from education, mediums from age, living situation, employment, and physical health, and lows elsewhere. The high education risk is significant, but the presence of employment and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. I'm predicting a YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because there are both risk and protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some involvement with the law but is not as severe as a conviction.\"),\n    (\"physical_health\", \"medium\", \"Being underweight could indicate health issues or instability, which might contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate less social support, which is a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits job opportunities and increases the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs in the past year may indicate job instability, which can be a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is a risk factor but is less severe than other drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk of mental health-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"A stable family environment in childhood is protective against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
