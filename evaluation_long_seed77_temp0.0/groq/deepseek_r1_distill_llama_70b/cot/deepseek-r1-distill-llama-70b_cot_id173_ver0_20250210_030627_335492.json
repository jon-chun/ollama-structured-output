    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that she was involved in a minor offense or perhaps a first-time mistake. Since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a prior conviction, so I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'0\" and 148 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but generally, physical attributes aren't strong predictors, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence support systems. Being unmarried and not living alone might mean she has a family network, which could be protective. However, not living alone might also mean she's in a shared environment where influences could vary. I'm not sure, so maybe medium risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can limit job opportunities and stability. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is another significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This is definitely high risk.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years. Drug use is a major risk factor, but since she hasn't used any recently, this is a positive sign. So, low risk here.\n\nShe's felt down in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. This could be a medium risk factor because untreated mental health issues can lead to poor decision-making.\n\nShe grew up in a household of size five. A larger household might indicate less individual attention or resources, which could be a risk, but it's not as direct as other factors. Maybe medium risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has a role in her life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide a support system or moral framework. The absence might be a low risk factor, but it's not as significant as others.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are lack of education and unemployment. Medium risks include age, mental health, household size, and living situation. Low risks are prior arrest without conviction, physical attributes, drug abstinence, and spiritual beliefs. The high-risk factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher confidence that she might reoffend, but not extremely high because some factors are mitigating. So, I'll predict YES with about 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"No conviction suggests a minor or first-time offense.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma limits job opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can lead to poor decision-making if untreated.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"medium\", \"Larger households may offer less individual support.\"),\n    (\"spiritual beliefs\", \"low\", \"Absence of spiritual support might lack a moral framework.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
