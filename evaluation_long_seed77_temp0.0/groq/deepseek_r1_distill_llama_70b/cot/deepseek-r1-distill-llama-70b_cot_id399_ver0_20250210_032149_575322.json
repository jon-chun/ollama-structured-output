    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and between 125-149 lbs. This is average and doesn't particularly stand out as a risk factor. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving alone at 19 could mean he doesn't have a strong support system, which might increase the risk of reoffending. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can lead to higher recidivism. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, medium risk here.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, is a significant factor. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression. Mental health issues can influence recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed recently, this might lower the risk a bit. I'll rate this as low.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size five. Larger households might have more stress or less individual attention, which could contribute to behavioral issues. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nBelieving that God influences personal events might provide a sense of purpose or support, which could be protective against recidivism. So, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, education, and drug use. Medium factors include prior arrest, living alone, employment, and household size. Low factors are physical build, recent mental health, and religious beliefs. The high and medium factors suggest a higher likelihood of rearrest, so I'll predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest without conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is less severe than a conviction.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not particularly stand out as risk factors.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong support system, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can contribute to financial instability and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk compared to active mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Larger household may contribute to stress or less individual support.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide protective support against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
