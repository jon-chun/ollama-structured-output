    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So, I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some level of criminal involvement, but since it's only one arrest, it's not an extensive history. I think this is a medium risk factor because while it's a concern, it's not multiple offenses.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant factor. Maybe low risk because there's no indication it contributes to criminal behavior.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could mean less social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more at risk, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor as it provides opportunities and structure. This should lower his risk, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and idleness. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use, especially with marijuana and cocaine, is a significant concern. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal activities. I'll mark this as high risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not experiencing depression now, this might be a lower risk. However, without knowing his history, I'm cautious, so maybe medium.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and less resources, which might influence behavior. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can be a protective factor. Religious beliefs often provide a sense of purpose and community, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, unemployment, and drug use. Medium factors include prior conviction, living situation, mental health, and upbringing. Protective factors are education and religion. The high factors might outweigh the protective ones, leading me to predict a higher chance of rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong risk factors, the presence of education and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates some criminal involvement but is not extensive.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and college enrollment are protective factors.\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment can lead to financial instability and increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"No recent depression, but mental health can still impact behavior.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may expose individuals to higher crime rates.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
