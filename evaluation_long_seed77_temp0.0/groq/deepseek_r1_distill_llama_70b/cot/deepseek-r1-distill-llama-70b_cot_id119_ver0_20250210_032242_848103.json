    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might engage in more impulsive behaviors. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 190 lbs. While physical build can sometimes be a factor in certain crimes, it's not a strong indicator on its own. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence behavior; being single and living alone might reduce social controls, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor as it provides structure and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. This seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can stabilize an individual, but having only one job might indicate some instability. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently feeling depressed, this might be a low factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, but urban environments might expose him to higher crime rates. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is drug use, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors include age, living situation, and employment instability. The low factors are his education, lack of conviction, and religious beliefs. Balancing these, I think the overall prediction is a medium risk, but since the question is about a binary YES/NO, I'll lean towards YES because of the drug use. My confidence is around 65% because while there are protective factors, the drug use is a significant concern.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some risk but is not severe.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical build alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social controls and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Education provides structure and opportunities, reducing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability might indicate higher risk factors.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No current depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Stable family but urban environment may pose risks.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
