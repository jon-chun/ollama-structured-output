    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while it's not the highest, it does contribute to potential recidivism.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant number for someone so young. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This seems like a high risk factor because it shows a history of engaging in criminal activities despite previous legal consequences.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 175-199 lbs. While this might make him stand out, physical size alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism. I don't see this as a major risk factor, so I'll mark it as low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 19 isn't unusual, but living with others might mean less stability or more exposure to negative influences. This could be a medium risk factor because living situation can impact behavior, but it's not as direct as other factors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or boredom. This is a high risk factor because education is a key factor in rehabilitation and reducing recidivism.\n\nHe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate irresponsibility or an inability to maintain steady employment, which might lead to criminal behavior as an alternative. This is a medium risk factor because while it's concerning, it's not as severe as other factors like substance abuse.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism because it can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Untreated mental health problems can increase the likelihood of substance abuse or criminal behavior. This is a medium risk factor because while it's important, it's not as directly linked as substance abuse.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size four isn't particularly large, so family environment might not be a major issue. I don't see this as a significant risk factor, so low.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life, which can be a protective factor. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and moral framework, potentially reducing recidivism. This is a low risk factor because it might help him stay on a positive path.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his criminal history, lack of education, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living situation, job instability, and mental health. Low factors are physical size, household size, and religious beliefs. The high factors are strong indicators, so I predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while the factors are concerning, there's still a chance for intervention and positive change.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase criminal involvement risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could contribute to risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability and higher recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
