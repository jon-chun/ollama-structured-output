    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a higher risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nNext, she's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that she was involved in a minor offense or perhaps a first-time mistake. However, having an arrest on her record could still be a risk factor, though maybe not as high as a conviction. I'm leaning towards medium here because it shows some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and 127 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are significant risk factors for recidivism. People of all sizes can commit crimes, so this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have a strong support system, which could be a risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. So, I might rate this as medium because the lack of a support system could contribute to higher risk.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school. Education is a positive factor. It shows she's engaged in productive activities, which can reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. This should be a low risk factor because being in school is a protective factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment can provide stability and reduce recidivism. Having a job, even if it's just one, is a positive sign. So, this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to impaired judgment and involvement in criminal activities to support a habit. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she hasn't felt depressed recently, this might not be a current issue. However, if she has a history of depression, it could still be a factor, but with the info given, I might rate this as low.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of five. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Growing up with both parents can provide support and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide a moral framework and support system. A lack of such beliefs might not be a direct risk factor, but it could indicate a lack of certain support structures. I'm not sure about this one, but maybe it's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are her age and drug use. Medium factors include living alone and the prior arrest. The rest are low. So, the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are both positive and negative factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest indicates some involvement with the law, though without conviction it's less severe.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a strong support system may increase risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, potentially leading to criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Having a job provides stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Enrollment in school is a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
