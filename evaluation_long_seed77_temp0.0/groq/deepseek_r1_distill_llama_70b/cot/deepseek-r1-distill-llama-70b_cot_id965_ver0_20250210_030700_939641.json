    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old individual to predict if he'll be rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and might be more influenced by peers. So I'm thinking age is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that he's had some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record. So I'll mark prior criminal history as low.\n\nHis ethnicity is American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut. I'm not sure how much this directly impacts recidivism, but socioeconomic factors related to ethnicity might play a role. However, without specific data, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and 160 lbs. I don't see height and weight as significant factors for recidivism, so that's low.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could increase the risk of reoffending. So I'll rate living situation as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit job opportunities, which could increase recidivism risk. So education is medium.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. So employment history is medium.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a common factor in recidivism. It can impair judgment and lead to further legal issues. So substance abuse is high.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues, like depression, can increase recidivism risk if not addressed. So mental health is medium.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size four when young. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so family background is low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation might reduce a protective factor, but I'm not sure how significant this is. I'll mark it as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is substance abuse, and several mediums. So I think the prediction is YES, but my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"prior criminal history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some legal involvement but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone isn't a strong indicator without additional socioeconomic context.\"),\n    (\"height/weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics don't significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use is a known risk factor for recidivism, potentially impairing judgment.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"A stable family environment is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce a protective factor but isn't highly significant.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
