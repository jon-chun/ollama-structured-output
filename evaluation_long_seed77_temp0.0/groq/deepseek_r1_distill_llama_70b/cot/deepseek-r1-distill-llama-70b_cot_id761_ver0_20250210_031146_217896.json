Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might engage in more impulsive behavior. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that he's had run-ins with the law, but the lack of convictions could mean the charges were dropped or he wasn't found guilty. This could suggest some involvement in criminal activity, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. While this might make him stand out, there's no direct correlation between physical size and criminal behavior, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might reduce social support, which can increase recidivism risk, but not being married at 20 isn't unusual. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, so having a diploma is good, but not pursuing further education might limit his opportunities, which could be a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, so I'll consider this medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years and no recent depression. These are positive signs as substance abuse and mental health issues often correlate with higher recidivism. Both of these will be low risk factors.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but since he had a stable home, the risk is lower.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the medium factors are age and employment instability, but the rest are low. His positive family background, education, and lack of substance abuse are strong protective factors. So I predict a low risk of rearrest with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life experience.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest potential involvement in criminal activity, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses or successful legal outcomes.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year could indicate instability, which might contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, but at 20, it is not uncommon and may not significantly impact recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
