    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because while it's not the highest, it's still a significant age where decisions can lead to recidivism.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a high risk factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning and suggests a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 175-199 lbs. I don't see this as a significant risk factor. Physical build alone doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of stable social support, which can be a medium risk factor. Marriage and stable relationships often provide a support system that can reduce recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a high risk factor because education is a key factor in employment and stability, which can reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Without education, job prospects are limited, increasing the risk.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a medium risk factor. Steady employment can reduce recidivism, so having only one job suggests instability, which could contribute to higher risk.\n\nDrug use with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a high risk factor. Drugs can lead to criminal behavior to support habits and impair judgment, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health might not be a current issue, but I'm not sure if that's a factor here. Maybe it's low since he's not currently experiencing depression.\n\nLiving in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal activity, so this is a medium risk factor. It might have influenced his early behavior and exposure to crime.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but if he feels disconnected, it might not provide the same support. I'm not sure, but maybe it's a low risk factor since it's more about personal belief than direct behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his criminal history, lack of education, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living situation, employment, and upbringing. Low factors are physical build and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, his prediction for rearrest is likely YES. My confidence is around 85% because multiple high-risk factors are present, but there might be some mitigating circumstances not mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior that is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor as it limits employment opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment history can contribute to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism as it can lead to criminal behavior to support a drug habit.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"urban upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime rates and influences that can contribute to recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
