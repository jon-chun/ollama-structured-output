    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Hispanic male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it still indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think this is a low risk factor because it's not a repeated issue.\n\nHis marital status is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of reoffending. So I'd consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED, which is a positive as it shows he has some education. Not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities, but having a GED is better than not having one. This could be a low risk factor because education can reduce recidivism.\n\nEmployment-wise, he's held two jobs in the past year. Stable employment is a protective factor against recidivism, so having two jobs suggests some stability. I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a common factor in recidivism. However, since it's not specified as current use, it might be a moderate risk. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults at a young age could indicate instability in his upbringing, which might contribute to higher risk. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't feel that God has control over his life. Lack of religious beliefs can sometimes be associated with lower recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are mixed but lean towards lower recidivism. His stable marriage and employment are strong positives. So I predict a \"NO\" with 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher-risk age group for recidivism, though not the highest.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"low\", \"One arrest and conviction, indicating limited criminal history.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with spouse can provide stability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"GED indicates some education, which is positive.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs, suggesting some stability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use could indicate substance issues.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Unstable upbringing may contribute to higher risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence may not strongly impact recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
