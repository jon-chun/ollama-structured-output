    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. That could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as concerning as multiple arrests or actual convictions. So maybe that's a lower risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'3\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical build is a strong indicator for recidivism, so I'll consider that low.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Not being married isn't a big deal, but living with others might provide more support, which could be protective. So maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism because of limited job opportunities. That might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. That seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years. That's a positive sign. Drug use is a known risk factor, so not using is a low risk.\n\nShe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, especially if untreated. This might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Stable family environment is a protective factor, so that's low. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but she's from a stable home, so maybe that's not too bad.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's a protective factor, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The main concerns are job instability and mental health. However, she has protective factors like stable upbringing and no drug use. So overall, I think the prediction is low for rearrest, with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"At 22, while young, this age alone isn't a strong indicator without other factors.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"No indication that height or weight contributes to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Not married but living with others may provide social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED without college might limit job opportunities, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Four jobs in a year could indicate instability, a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive indicator.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family background is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
