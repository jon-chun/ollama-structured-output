    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or impulsivity. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that he's had some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor because the absence of a conviction might mean the offense wasn't too serious or there wasn't enough evidence.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. While this might make him appear more intimidating, physical build alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and idleness, which might drive someone to criminal activity. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Drug use is a known risk factor, but since he's abstained, this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Depression or low mood can increase the risk of engaging in criminal behavior, especially if left untreated. So this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but since he had a stable home, it might balance out.\n\nHe doesn't consider God's influence in his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism, but it's not a strong factor on its own. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is unemployment, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors are age, living alone, and mental health. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because some factors are mitigating. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"While having an arrest on record indicates some involvement with the law, the lack of conviction suggests the offense may not have been severe or there was insufficient evidence.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Physical build alone is not a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to financial instability and idleness.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is a positive indicator, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate mental health issues that may increase the risk of reoffending if untreated.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may have some correlation with higher recidivism rates but is not a strong indicator on its own.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
