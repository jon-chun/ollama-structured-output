    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age where decision-making isn't fully matured.\n\nHe's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate either that he's been in situations where he's at risk, but not necessarily guilty, or that he's had multiple run-ins with the law without severe consequences. This could be a medium risk factor because frequent arrests suggest ongoing issues, even without convictions.\n\nHis height and weight: 5'5\" and 210 lbs. That's a high BMI, possibly indicating obesity. Health issues related to obesity could affect his mental health or limit his opportunities, which might indirectly increase recidivism risk. I'll consider this a low risk factor since it's more of an indirect influence.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others could mean he has a support system, which is a protective factor. However, not living alone might also mean less stability if the household is unstable. I'm leaning towards low risk here because the support could be more beneficial than detrimental.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, but not pursuing higher education might limit his job opportunities, which could be a risk. I'll rate this as medium because while he has a foundation, the lack of further education could hinder his progress.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability is a red flag. It suggests he might have issues with employment, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of reoffending. This seems like a high risk factor because frequent job changes can indicate deeper issues.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to impaired judgment and association with criminal activities. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe's felt down most of the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase recidivism if not addressed, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban household of four. Urban areas might have higher crime rates and less resources, but living with a biological parent is a protective factor. The household size isn't too large, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, acting as a protective factor. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are drug use, mental health issues, and job instability. Medium factors include his age, number of arrests, and education level. The low factors are his health, living situation, marital status, upbringing, and religious beliefs. The high factors are quite significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk of rearrest. However, the protective factors might mitigate this a bit. I'll predict a YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because of the protective elements. Maybe around 72% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity and less life stability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest ongoing legal issues, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses or successful legal outcomes.\"),\n    (\"health/weight\", \"low\", \"Obesity may contribute to health issues but isn't a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others can provide support, reducing isolation that might contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is positive, but not pursuing further education might limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"high\", \"Frequent job changes can indicate instability, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism due to its impact on judgment and behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"high\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated, affecting decision-making and behavior.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological parent in an urban area provides some stability despite potential environmental challenges.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
