    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests, but it still indicates some involvement with the law. I think this is a low risk factor because it's just one arrest and no conviction.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and between 225-249 lbs. While this might make him stand out, there's no direct correlation between physical size and criminal behavior. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Being unmarried and living alone can sometimes indicate a lack of strong social support, which might increase recidivism risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, increasing the likelihood of recidivism. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. However, having two jobs shows he's employable, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it some times in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can increase recidivism risk, so this is a medium factor.\n\nHe felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism if not addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size five. Larger households might have more stress or less individual attention, which could be a risk, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are mixed but lean towards medium. However, considering the presence of mental health issues and drug use, I'm inclined to predict a higher likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 65% because while there are several medium factors, some factors like employment and education might mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and life instability.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction is a lower risk factor compared to multiple arrests or convictions.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"Physical size alone does not strongly correlate with criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Being unmarried and living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs indicates employability, which can be a stabilizing factor.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use could indicate ongoing substance use, which increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down may indicate underlying mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Growing up in a larger household may have stressors but isn't a strong risk indicator.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
