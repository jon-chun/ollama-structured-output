    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor because it's just one arrest without a formal conviction.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could mean less social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. Without a stable family environment, individuals might be more at risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited educational attainment. This can lead to fewer job opportunities, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. So I'll mark education as high risk.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year, which points to unemployment. Unemployment is a significant risk factor because it can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, is a concern. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. I'll rate this as high.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower his risk. So I'll consider mental health status as low.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of 11 in a rural area could have its challenges. Large family sizes might lead to less individual attention, and rural areas might have fewer resources. However, without more specifics, I'm not sure how significant this is. I'll rate it as medium.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life might indicate a lack of spiritual support, which some studies suggest can be protective against recidivism. So this could be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education, employment, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living situation, and upbringing. Low factors are prior arrest, physical attributes, mental health, and spirituality. The high-risk factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are strong indicators, some factors like no conviction and stable mental health might mitigate the risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates some risk but is less severe than a conviction.\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a strong predictor of recidivism due to limited opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it leads to financial instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is strongly linked to higher recidivism rates due to impaired judgment and behavior.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Large household size in a rural area may contribute to environmental risk factors.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Lack of spiritual belief may reduce protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
