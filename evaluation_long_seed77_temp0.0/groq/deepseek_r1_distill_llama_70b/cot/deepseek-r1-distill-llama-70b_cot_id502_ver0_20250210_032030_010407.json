    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, she's not a juvenile anymore, so maybe the risk isn't as high as it could be. I'll mark age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, women tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to men. So, her gender might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction could mean it was a minor offense or a first-time mistake. This might not weigh too heavily, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'3\" and 175-199 lbs. While being overweight can have health implications, it's not directly linked to criminal behavior. So, this is probably a low risk factor.\n\nShe's never married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate independence, but not being married at 20 isn't unusual. This doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism, so low risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Having an education is a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit her opportunities, which could be a medium risk.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be stabilizing, but frequent job changes might indicate instability. However, two jobs in a year isn't too bad, so maybe medium risk.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can increase recidivism risk. Since it's marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe's felt down lately. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a small household in a rural area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so low risk.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The main concerns are her age, job instability, drug use, and mental health. However, she has protective factors like education and family stability. So, I'll predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests a lower risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs in a year may indicate instability, which could elevate recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 20 is not unusual and doesn't strongly correlate with recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"A stable upbringing with biological parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
