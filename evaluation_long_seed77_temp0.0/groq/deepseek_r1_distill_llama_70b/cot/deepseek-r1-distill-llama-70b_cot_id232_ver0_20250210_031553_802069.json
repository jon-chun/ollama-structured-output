Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males, so that might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction could mean it was a minor offense or a one-time mistake. That seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'3\" and 185 lbs. While being overweight might have health implications, I'm not sure how directly that ties to criminal behavior. Maybe low risk.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. That sounds like a low risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities due to financial stress. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, but since it's not a harder drug, maybe medium.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she's not feeling depressed now, that's a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally positive. Maybe low risk.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism. That's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is unemployment, which is significant. Medium factors are age, lack of education, and drug use. The rest are low. So, the overall prediction might lean towards a higher risk, but considering the stabilizing factors like marriage and religion, maybe it's medium. But since unemployment is high, I might lean towards predicting YES with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is relatively young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not extremely high risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female gender is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area is a stable upbringing, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide moral guidance and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
