    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal history, which is a known predictor of recidivism. However, it's not an extensive record, so I might consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'9\" and 190 lbs. While this makes him physically imposing, I'm not sure how directly that ties to recidivism. Maybe in certain contexts, but overall, I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate less social support, which could increase recidivism risk. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism, but having only a high school diploma without further education might limit his opportunities, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism. So, medium here.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if not current, can be a risk factor, but since it's not recent, maybe medium.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, so mental health might not be a current issue, but I'm not sure. Maybe low risk.\n\nLiving in a household of size three as a child. Larger households might have more support, but smaller ones could have less, but I'm not certain. Maybe low.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this might be a protective factor, hence low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are a mix of high, medium, and low. The high factors are age and criminal history, but he also has some protective factors like education and religious beliefs. So, I think the overall prediction is YES for recidivism, but my confidence isn't too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal history, which is a known predictor of recidivism, though not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"While physically imposing, height and weight alone are not strong indicators of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma without further education may limit opportunities and increase risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a risk factor, though not recent, it still poses some risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression, so mental health is not a current risk factor.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Living in a smaller household may have less support, but impact is uncertain.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
