    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 21-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a significant history. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. This seems like a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height is 5'7\", which is average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. It doesn't really influence recidivism, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and social support, which are protective against recidivism. Without that, his risk might be higher. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't in college. Education can reduce recidivism by providing better job opportunities. Not being enrolled might limit his options, so medium risk here.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could mean he's struggling to maintain employment, which is a risk for recidivism. Unstable employment is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Substance abuse and mental health issues are big risk factors, but since he's clear on both, this is a low risk.\n\nHe grew up in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and less resources, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his criminal history and maybe the urban upbringing. The medium factors include age, living alone, education, and job instability. The low factors are height, recent mental health, and religious views.\n\nSo, considering all these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't super high because there are some positive factors like no drug use and stable mental health. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, the individual is in a higher risk demographic for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Three prior arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height is not a significant factor in recidivism risk assessment.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never being married and living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED but not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities and stability, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in one year suggests instability, which can contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces this risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression suggest better mental health, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large household in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime environments and fewer resources.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"A lack of religious influence may not provide the same protective factors against recidivism as active religious engagement.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
