    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can increase the risk of recidivism. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, women tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to men, so her gender might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and has a conviction. A single arrest and conviction could indicate a lower risk since it's not a repeated offense. So I'll consider criminal history as low.\n\nHer education is a high school diploma and she's enrolled in a 4-year college. Higher education is a protective factor as it provides stability and better opportunities, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So education is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held five jobs in the past year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate financial instability or behavioral issues, so I'll rate employment history as medium.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, so her abstinence lowers this risk to low.\n\nShe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Mental health problems can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so I'll rate mental health as medium.\n\nLiving alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. So living situation is medium.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so family background is low.\n\nHer religious beliefs might provide a support system and moral framework, reducing recidivism risk. So religion is low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The presence of positive factors like education and stable family background outweigh the medium risks like age and employment instability. So I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity and less life stability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"A single arrest and conviction may indicate a lower risk of recidivism compared to multiple offenses.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate mental health issues that may increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household reduces recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide a support system and moral framework, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
