    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's significant because a history of multiple arrests and a conviction indicates a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This definitely points to a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Unless there's something specific about his physical build that's related to criminal behavior, which I don't think is the case, this factor is probably low.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could indicate a lack of stable social support. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So I'd consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited educational attainment. Lower education can lead to fewer job opportunities, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk. However, having some employment is better than none, so I might rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over the past four years, is a concern. Substance use can contribute to criminal behavior, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, the risk might be lower than if it were something else. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nLiving in a household of size five at a young age could mean limited resources or more chaotic environments, which might contribute to delinquency. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some protective factor, as religious involvement can sometimes reduce recidivism. So this would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age, criminal history, and education. Medium factors include living situation, employment, drug use, and household size. The protective factor is his religious belief. Considering all these, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, and my confidence is around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential instability and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Limited educational attainment can reduce opportunities and increase criminal engagement risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability might indicate difficulty in maintaining steady, lawful income.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder substances.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Larger households might contribute to chaotic environments.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
