    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate that he's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily serious enough to lead to convictions. This could suggest some involvement in risky behavior, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 215 lbs. While this might make him stand out, by itself, it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor. However, not being married at 20 isn't unusual, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor as it provides stability and opportunities, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which might relate to higher recidivism risk. So I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to further criminal activity. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can change, so I'll note this as low.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk, but it's not a strong indicator, so I'll rate this as low.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are his age, job instability, and drug use. These factors lean towards a higher risk, so I'll predict a YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 75% because while there are significant risk factors, he also has some protective elements like education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction indicate some involvement in risky behavior but not necessarily serious criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical stature alone is not a significant indicator of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 20 is not unusual and does not strongly indicate risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year could indicate instability, which might correlate with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine is a significant risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious influence is not a strong indicator of risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
