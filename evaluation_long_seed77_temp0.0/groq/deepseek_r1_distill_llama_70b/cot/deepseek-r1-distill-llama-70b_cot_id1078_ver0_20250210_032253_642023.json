    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So age is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. High risk here.\n\nHe's Black, but I don't think race itself is a risk factor. It's more about systemic issues, but I won't assign a risk factor based on race alone.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so no risk factor there.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of stable social support, which can be a medium risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of recidivism. That's a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism, so that's high risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. While not as severe as harder drugs, any drug use can be a risk. I'll rate this medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health isn't a current issue. Low risk.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is a stabilizing factor. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism, but it's not a strong factor. I'll say low.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are high or medium. So the prediction is YES, and I'm about 85% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in risky behaviors.\"),\n    (\"arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"10 arrests and a conviction indicate a significant criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a concern but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment may have higher crime exposure, but living with a biological parent is stabilizing.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation has some correlation with recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
