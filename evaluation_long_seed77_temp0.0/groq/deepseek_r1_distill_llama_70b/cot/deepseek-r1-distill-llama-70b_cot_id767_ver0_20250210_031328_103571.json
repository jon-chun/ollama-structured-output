    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that could lead to rearrest. This seems like a high risk factor because it shows a history of engaging in criminal activity.\n\nHer employment status is unstable; she's held two jobs in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or opportunity. I'd consider this a medium risk factor because while it's not the most severe, it does contribute to overall risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of recidivism. This is a medium risk factor because education is a key component in rehabilitation and stability.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor as it might be linked to other behaviors or addictions that contribute to criminal activity. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'd rate this as medium.\n\nShe's experienced depression recently, feeling down for periods. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not properly addressed, as they might lead to poor decision-making or further substance abuse. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which is important for rehabilitation. Without a strong support system, the risk might increase, so I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHer living situation as a child was with her biological mother in a rural area. Rural areas might have fewer resources for support and rehabilitation, which could be a risk factor. However, since she's no longer in that environment, I'd consider this a low risk factor.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can be a protective factor. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are her age and criminal history. The medium factors include employment instability, lack of education, drug use, mental health, and living alone. The low factors are her upbringing and religious beliefs. Considering all these, I think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are some protective factors in place. So I'll set confidence at 72%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to rearrest.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs in the past year, suggesting potential instability that could contribute to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"lack of education\", \"medium\", \"No high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years could indicate substance-related behaviors contributing to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression may impact decision-making and increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, a key factor in rehabilitation.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a rural area; less direct impact as she's no longer in that environment.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
