    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because younger people are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors that could lead to rearrest.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that she was involved in a minor offense or perhaps a first-time mistake. This could be a low risk factor since it's a single arrest without a conviction history.\n\nHer height and weight don't seem particularly relevant to criminal behavior, so I'll consider that a low risk factor. It's more about physical description and less about behavior.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Being unmarried and not living alone might mean she has a support system, which could be a protective factor. However, if she's living with others who might have negative influences, it could vary. I'll rate this as low since the support could be positive.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher stress and potentially more desperation, which might increase the likelihood of criminal activity. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is a positive sign. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, so her abstinence lowers her risk. This is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size four isn't particularly large, so family environment might not be a significant issue. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHer religious beliefs might provide a support system and moral framework, which can be a protective factor against recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are her educational background and employment instability. The medium factors are her age, recent mental health, and job changes. The low factors include arrest without conviction, living situation, physical attributes, family size, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, her overall risk seems moderate. However, the lack of education and unstable employment are significant, so I'm leaning towards a higher risk. But since she hasn't been convicted and doesn't use drugs, it's not the highest. I'll predict a YES for rearrest but with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behaviors.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction suggests lower risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED limits opportunities, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate financial stress.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could affect behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Support system may reduce risk.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"May provide protective framework.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
