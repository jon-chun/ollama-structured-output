    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old female to predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger offenders, especially those in their late teens, are generally at a higher risk of recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or lack stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested seven times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests at a young age, indicating a pattern of behavior that's concerning. Prior convictions are strong predictors of future criminal behavior, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHer employment status is unstable; she's only held one job in the past year. Unemployment or job instability can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to criminal activities. This seems like a medium risk factor because while it's not the most severe, it does contribute to the overall risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or due to fewer opportunities. This is another medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially with harder drugs like cocaine, is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. It can lead to further criminal behavior to support the habit. So, substance abuse is a high risk factor.\n\nLiving situation: she's not living alone and comes from a large household. While living in a larger household might provide some support, it could also indicate instability or lack of supervision, especially if the household is urban and possibly resource-challenged. I'm not sure about this one, but maybe it's a low risk factor since the support could be positive.\n\nShe considers God's influence in her life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose or community that might reduce recidivism. So this could be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, she has several high-risk factors like age, prior arrests, and substance abuse, which are strong predictors. The medium factors like education and employment add to the risk. The protective factors like her beliefs might lower the risk a bit, but overall, the high-risk factors dominate. So, I predict she's likely to be rearrested, with a confidence level around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, especially those in late adolescence, are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrests and convictions\", \"high\", \"Seven arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can contribute to financial stress and increased likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and may contribute to cycles of poverty and crime.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, particularly with cocaine, is a strong indicator of potential ongoing issues that can lead to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Living in a larger household in an urban area may provide some support, though it could also indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
