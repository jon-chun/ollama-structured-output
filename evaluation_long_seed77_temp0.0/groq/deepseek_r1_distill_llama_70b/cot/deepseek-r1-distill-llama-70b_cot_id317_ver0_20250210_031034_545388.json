    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic male and predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might not have fully developed impulse control and may be more influenced by peer groups. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal history with convictions. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 215 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, physical size alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism. So I'll mark this as low.\n\nLiving alone and never being married. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but not being married at 20 isn't unusual. This seems like a medium risk factor because the lack of a stable family environment could contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having one, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially leading to higher risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability can be a risk factor because it might indicate irresponsibility or an inability to maintain steady employment, which is a protective factor against recidivism. So this is a medium risk.\n\nDrug use is a significant factor. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used some in the past month. Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism because it can lead to criminal behavior to support the habit. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's experienced depression recently. Mental health issues, especially feeling down, can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis upbringing was in an urban area with a large household. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and less resources, which could contribute to higher risk. Living in a larger household might also indicate less individual attention, but I'm not sure how significant this is. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community. So this might lower his risk, making it a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and drug use. Medium factors include prior arrest, living situation, education, employment, mental health, and upbringing. Low factors are physical size and religious beliefs. The presence of multiple medium and a couple of high factors makes me lean towards a higher risk. However, the protective factor of religious beliefs might mitigate some risk. So I'll predict a YES for rearrest but with a confidence level that's not extremely high, maybe around 72%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and peer influence.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"While not as severe as a conviction, it indicates some criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"Size alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation and marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED is positive, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes suggest instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism due to potential criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent depression can increase risky behaviors and recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing in urban area\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may have higher crime rates and fewer resources.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 72\n}\n```",
