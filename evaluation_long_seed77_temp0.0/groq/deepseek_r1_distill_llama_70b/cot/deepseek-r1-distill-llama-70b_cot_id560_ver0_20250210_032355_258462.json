    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old individual to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Two arrests and a conviction indicate some criminal history, but it's not an extensive record. This could be a moderate indicator, so I'll mark criminal history as medium.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll consider that a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone and never being married might point to a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk. So living situation is medium.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can lead to higher recidivism. Education is a high risk factor here.\n\nUnemployment is a significant factor. Having no jobs in the past year could mean financial instability, which is a known contributor to criminal behavior. So employment status is high risk.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years, is a concern. While not the most severe drug, any drug use can impair judgment and is linked to recidivism. So substance abuse is medium.\n\nMental health issues, like feeling down, could indicate unaddressed problems that might increase recidivism risk if not managed. So mental health is medium.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban area as a child might have provided some stability, but urban environments can also have higher crime rates. However, having both parents is a protective factor, so family background is low.\n\nReligious beliefs might provide a support system and moral framework, which can be protective. So religion is low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are education and employment, which are strong predictors. The medium factors include age, criminal history, living situation, substance abuse, and mental health. The low factors are physical characteristics, family background, and religion. \n\nConsidering all these, the individual has several high and medium risk factors, which might outweigh the low ones. Therefore, the prediction is YES for rearrest, and I'm about 80% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals, especially males, are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate some criminal history, which is a moderate risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical characteristics\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never being married may indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED and no college enrollment suggests limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which is a known contributor to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years could indicate substance abuse issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down for extended periods could indicate unaddressed mental health issues, which may increase recidivism risk if not managed.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household during childhood is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide moral guidance and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
