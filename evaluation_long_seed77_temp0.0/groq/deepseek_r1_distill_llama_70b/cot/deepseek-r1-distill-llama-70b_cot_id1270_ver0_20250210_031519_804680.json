    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old Hispanic male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and haven't yet stabilized in their lives.\n\nHe's been arrested once and has a conviction. A prior conviction is a significant risk factor because it indicates past involvement in criminal activity, which can be a predictor of future behavior. However, since it's only one conviction, it's not as high as someone with multiple convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 240 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, physical size alone isn't a strong indicator of recidivism. It could be a factor in certain contexts, but on its own, it's probably low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence recidivism. Being unmarried and living alone might indicate a lack of stable social support, which can increase the risk of reoffending. I'd rate this as medium.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without a steady income, individuals might resort to illegal activities out of necessity or due to a lack of structured activities. This is another high-risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and can be linked to criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower the risk associated with mental health issues, but the drug use itself is still concerning. I'd rate this as high.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Living in an urban environment, especially in high-crime areas, can expose individuals to more criminal influences and opportunities. This is a medium-risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community, which might reduce recidivism risk. So, this is a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. Medium factors include living alone and urban upbringing. Age and religious beliefs are lower. The combination of multiple high-risk factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. Therefore, the prediction is YES, and I'm about 85% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential ongoing behavioral issues and life instability.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction indicates past criminal involvement but isn't as severe as multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"physical size\", \"low\", \"While intimidating, size alone isn't a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without marital support may indicate lack of stable social support, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, increasing the likelihood of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"employment status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to criminal behavior due to financial necessity or lack of structure.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for impaired judgment and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may expose individuals to higher crime rates and influences.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
