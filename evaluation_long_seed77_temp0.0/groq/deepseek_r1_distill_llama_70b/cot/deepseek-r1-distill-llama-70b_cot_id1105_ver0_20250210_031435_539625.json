    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old Hispanic female's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or have less stable life structures. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that she's had some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. This could be a low risk factor because it shows she's had a brush with the law but didn't result in a conviction, which might mean it was a minor offense or she's taking steps to avoid further issues.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't think physical build is a major contributor here, so I'll consider that low.\n\nShe's never been married and not living alone. Being unmarried and living with others might mean she has a support system, which is a protective factor. However, not living alone could also mean less stability if the household is large or chaotic. But overall, I think this leans towards a low risk factor because having a support system can reduce recidivism.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a strong protective factor. It shows she's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, which can lower the likelihood of rearrest. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held four jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism. Frequent job changes might suggest she's struggling to maintain employment, which could lead to financial instability and increase the risk of reoffending. So I'd rate this as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor. It might indicate substance use issues, which can contribute to criminal behavior. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I might rate this as medium.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she's not experiencing depression now, this is a low risk factor.\n\nShe grew up in a large household of seven in an urban area. A large household might mean less individual attention, and urban areas can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risky environments. This could be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means she doesn't have a strong support system or moral framework, but this can vary. I might rate this as low since the impact can be subjective.\n\nPutting it all together, the risk factors are a mix of low, medium, and one low. The presence of job instability and drug use are the main medium factors. However, her education and support system are strong protective factors. So overall, I think the prediction is NO for rearrest, with a confidence level around 70% because while there are some risks, the protective factors are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential ongoing development and life instability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests limited involvement with the law, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests engagement in positive activities and better opportunities, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding four jobs in a year may indicate instability, which could contribute to financial stress and increased recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use could indicate substance use issues, which might contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living with others may provide a support system, acting as a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large urban household might expose her to higher crime environments and less individual attention.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce a potential protective factor, though impact can vary.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
