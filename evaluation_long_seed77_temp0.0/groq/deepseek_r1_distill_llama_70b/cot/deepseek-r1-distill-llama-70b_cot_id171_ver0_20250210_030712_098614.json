    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. Statistically, females tend to have lower recidivism rates compared to males, so gender here is a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate less severe involvement in criminal activity, so I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to pose a significant risk. That's low.\n\nLiving alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk, but she's also in college, which is a positive factor. I'll balance this as medium.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in college, which is a protective factor. Education usually correlates with lower recidivism, so this is low risk.\n\nHaving held three jobs in a year might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if not current, can be a risk factor, but since it's not specified as ongoing, I'll consider it low.\n\nNo recent depression is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so this is low.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is protective, so this is low.\n\nShe has a religious belief, which can provide support and reduce recidivism. That's another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low, with a couple medium. Her positive factors like education and family background likely outweigh the medium risks. So I predict a low risk of rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential instability.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One prior arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal involvement.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not indicate heightened risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which could increase risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is less indicative of serious criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces mental health-related risks.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological parents is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
