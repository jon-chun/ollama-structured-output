    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be figuring out their lives and may be more impulsive. So I'm leaning towards a medium risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction isn't too bad, but it does show some involvement with the law. I think this is a medium risk factor because it's not a repeat offense, but it's still a concern.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet and 190 lbs. I'm not sure how much physical build impacts recidivism. Maybe in some contexts, but I don't see it as a significant factor here. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behavior. So this seems like a low risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a strong indicator of lower recidivism. Being in college suggests he's focused on his future and less likely to get into trouble. Definitely a low risk here.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can provide stability and reduce the need for criminal activity. However, having two jobs might indicate some instability or difficulty in maintaining employment, which could be a slight concern. I'm thinking medium risk for this one.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it can sometimes be linked to other behaviors. However, since it's not a harder drug, I don't see it as a high risk. Maybe medium, but considering it's just marijuana, perhaps low.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not feeling depressed now, this is a positive sign. So low risk here.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this is low risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but his stable upbringing might mitigate that.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are positive factors. So low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The higher risks are his age and employment stability, but the positives like education and marriage are strong. So I think the overall prediction is low for rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22 years old, individuals are in a higher risk group for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"arrest and conviction history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicates some involvement with the criminal justice system, but it's not extensive.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not strongly correlate with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide stability and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college suggests stability and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs in a year may indicate some instability, which could pose a moderate risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use is relatively common and not strongly indicative of high recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
