    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So, I'd rate age as a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. Prior convictions are strong predictors of recidivism, so this is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here. Unless there's something specific about his physical appearance that's linked to criminal behavior, which I don't think is the case, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could indicate a lack of stable social support. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to reoffend. So, I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college points to limited educational attainment. Education often provides opportunities and skills that can reduce criminal behavior, so this is a high-risk factor.\n\nUnemployment is another big one. Not having a job can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to commit crimes. So, unemployment is a high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years, is a concern. While marijuana is less severe than other drugs, any drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of criminal activity. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is a positive sign. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower his risk a bit. So, mental health is low risk here.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults at a young age could indicate instability in his upbringing, which is linked to higher recidivism rates. So, unstable upbringing is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some structure or moral guidance, which could be protective. So, religious beliefs are a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like age, prior arrests, education, and unemployment. These outweigh the lower-risk factors, so I predict a high likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 85% because while the factors are strong, there's always some uncertainty in individual cases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Six arrests indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, increasing the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"No specific risk associated with height and weight in this context.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education reduces opportunities and increases the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, increasing the risk of criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use, while less severe, can still impair judgment and contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk compared to those with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living with non-biological adults at a young age may indicate instability, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide moral guidance, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
