    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old woman's likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of experimentation or less stable life circumstances. So I might rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's female. From what I remember, females typically have lower recidivism rates compared to males. So her gender might be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and has a conviction. A single arrest and conviction could indicate a lower risk since it's not a repeated offense. So I might consider criminal history as low.\n\nHer education is a high school diploma and she's enrolled in a 4-year college. Higher education is a protective factor because it's associated with better opportunities and stability. So education would be a low risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor because it might indicate financial instability or issues with maintaining employment, which can lead to recidivism. So employment history might be medium.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor because it can lead to other behaviors or relapse. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe it's a medium risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since she hasn't felt depressed, this might be a low factor.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so family environment is low.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are low or medium. The higher risks are age and employment instability, but the protective factors like education and stable upbringing might outweigh them. So I think the overall prediction is low, and I'm about 75% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is considered young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Being female is generally associated with lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"One arrest and conviction suggest limited criminal history, which is a lower risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college indicates higher educational attainment, which is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held 3 jobs in the past year may indicate instability, which could be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use could indicate substance use issues, which are often linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed in the past month suggests better mental health, reducing the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Believing that God influences personal events can provide emotional support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
