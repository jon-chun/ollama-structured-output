    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age where decision-making isn't fully matured.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a high risk factor. Multiple arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. A conviction shows that at least one of those arrests led to a guilty verdict, which suggests more serious offenses.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably a low risk factor. There's no indication that his physical stature would contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which is a medium risk factor. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a high risk factor because it limits job opportunities, which can lead to higher chances of recidivism.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a medium risk factor. Steady employment can reduce recidivism, so having only one job suggests instability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent use, is a high risk factor. It can impair judgment and is often linked with criminal activity.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase the risk of recidivism, so this is a medium risk factor. Poor mental health can lead to poor decision-making and substance abuse.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so this is a medium risk factor. The influence of the neighborhood can play a role in criminal behavior.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. This could be a protective factor, but since it's not a strong indicator, I'll consider it low. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism, but it's not as impactful as other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his criminal history, lack of education, and drug use. Medium factors include age, living alone, unstable employment, mental health, and upbringing. The low factors are physical build and religious beliefs. The high-risk factors are significant, so I'm leaning towards a high confidence that he will be rearrested. But considering some medium factors might mitigate slightly, I'll set confidence at 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21 years old, he is in a high-risk age group for recidivism, as younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Four arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and is associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held only one job in the past year suggests instability, which can increase the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use could indicate ongoing substance use issues, which are linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling 'down in the dumps' suggests potential mental health issues that could contribute to recidivism if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of social support, which can increase the risk of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area in a household of size 4 may have exposed him to higher crime rates and socioeconomic challenges.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Believing that God influences personal events may provide some protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
