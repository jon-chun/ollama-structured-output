    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'll consider this a medium risk factor because the arrest shows some level of risk, but without a conviction, it's not as strong.\n\nHis physical build is 5'4\" and 125-149 lbs. Being of smaller stature might not necessarily be a significant risk factor on its own, but in some contexts, it could relate to perceptions or vulnerabilities. However, I don't see a strong correlation here, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate a lack of strong social support, which is a known risk factor for recidivism. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might increase his risk. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment and lack of education beyond high school are significant risk factors. Without a steady job or further education, he might lack structure and opportunities, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a common factor in recidivism, as it can be linked to criminal activity either directly or through association. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this isn't a factor. So, low risk here.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a rural area with a household size of three. A stable family environment with biological parents is a protective factor, so this would be low risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So, this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age and unemployment/education status. Medium factors include prior arrest, living alone, and drug use. The rest are low. Considering these, I think he's at a moderate risk overall, so I'll predict \"YES\" for rearrest but with a confidence level that's not too high, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest\", \"medium\", \"A prior arrest indicates some involvement with the law, though without conviction it's less severe.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Smaller stature alone isn't a significant risk factor.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support, a known risk factor.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment and lack of higher education can lead to instability and higher risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a common factor but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide protective support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
