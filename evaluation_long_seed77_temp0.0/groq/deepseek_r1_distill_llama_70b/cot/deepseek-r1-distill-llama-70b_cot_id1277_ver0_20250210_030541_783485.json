    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So, I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement with the law, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I think this is a low risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so physical build doesn't seem to pose a significant risk. That's probably a low factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 21 is common. I'm leaning towards medium here because the lack of a strong support system could be a factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is a protective factor. Being in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities and has better opportunities, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can reduce recidivism as it provides structure and income. However, having two jobs might indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use is a significant concern. He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and has used some in the past month. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's experienced depression recently, feeling down for periods. Mental health issues can increase recidivism if not addressed, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, so this is low. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but the stable family mitigates that, so maybe still low.\n\nHe has religious beliefs, which can provide support and reduce recidivism. This is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from drug use is a big concern, but he has protective factors like education and family. The prediction is probably NO because the positives might outweigh the negatives, but I'm not too confident. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"low\", \"While an arrest indicates some legal involvement, the lack of conviction suggests lower culpability or circumstances that may not strongly predict future offending.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not typically correlate with increased criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate less social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in college and having a stable work history are protective factors against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially with multiple substances, is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could indicate unmet mental health needs, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and support, reducing the likelihood of recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
