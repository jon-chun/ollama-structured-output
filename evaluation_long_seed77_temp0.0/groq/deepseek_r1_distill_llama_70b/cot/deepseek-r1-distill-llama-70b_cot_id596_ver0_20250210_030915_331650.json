    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Hispanic male's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their early 20s, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest and conviction might not be as significant as multiple offenses, but it does indicate some involvement with the criminal justice system. I think this is a medium risk factor because it shows a history, but it's not extensive.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so I don't see that as a significant risk factor. Physical build isn't a strong indicator of recidivism, so that's low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk, but being unmarried at 21 isn't unusual. I'm leaning towards low here because it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and idleness. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it's still a risk factor. However, since it's not a harder drug, I might rate this as medium.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a large household of 10 in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a large household might indicate less individual attention, which could be a risk. I think this is a medium factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can be a protective factor. Religious beliefs often correlate with lower recidivism because they can provide a sense of purpose and community. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is unemployment, mediums are age, criminal history, drug use, and upbringing, and lows are the rest. The high unemployment is a strong indicator, so I'm predicting YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't too high because other factors are medium or low. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 21, he is in a higher-risk age group for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest and conviction indicate some criminal involvement but not an extensive history.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being unmarried at 21 is common and not a strong risk factor on its own.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment and lack of higher education can lead to financial instability and idleness, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is a risk factor but less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests better mental health, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"A large household in an urban area may indicate less individual support and higher exposure to crime.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
