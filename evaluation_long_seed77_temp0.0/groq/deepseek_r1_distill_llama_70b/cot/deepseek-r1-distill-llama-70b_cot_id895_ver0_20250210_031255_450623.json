    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 20-year-old Black male who's been arrested four times and convicted. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to criminal behavior. So age might be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant history. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This seems like a high risk factor because it shows repeated involvement with the law.\n\nHis height is 6'6\". While this might make him stand out, I don't see height itself as a direct risk factor for recidivism. It's more of a physical characteristic without a clear link to criminal behavior, so I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living alone can sometimes indicate a lack of stable social support, which might contribute to higher risk. Without a strong support system, individuals might be more likely to reoffend. So this is probably a medium risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to unemployment, which is another risk factor. This seems high.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without a steady income, individuals might resort to criminal activities out of necessity or due to idle time. So this is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it some time in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps some time in the past month. This indicates possible mental health issues like depression. Untreated mental health problems can increase the risk of recidivism, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of seven. A large household might indicate overcrowding or less individual attention, which can contribute to behavioral issues. However, without more context, I'm not sure how significant this is. Maybe low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be linked to lower social support and higher risk, but this can vary. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are criminal history, lack of education, and unemployment. Medium factors include age, living alone, drug use, and mental health. Low factors are height, household size, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering all these, the high risk factors are quite strong, so the prediction is YES for recidivism. My confidence is around 85% because while there are several high-risk elements, some factors like drug use and mental health are moderate and might be addressable with intervention.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, contributing to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a concerning pattern of behavior.\"),\n    (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height alone isn't a direct risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of stable social support.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education limits job opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can impair judgment but isn't as severe as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Depression can increase recidivism risk if untreated.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Large household may contribute to behavioral issues but isn't significant alone.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may reduce social support but varies.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
