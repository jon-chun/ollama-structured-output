    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old woman. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might have higher impulsivity, which can lead to risky behaviors. However, she's married and living with her spouse, which might provide stability. So, age could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction does indicate some level of past involvement in criminal activity, but it's only one instance. This could be a medium risk factor because it shows she's had legal issues before, but it's not a extensive history.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't see how that would influence recidivism much, so low risk.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can provide emotional support and stability, which are positive factors. This likely reduces the risk, so low.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can impact employment opportunities, but having a diploma is a foundation. Not attending college might limit her job options, but she's held three jobs in a year, which shows she's employable. Maybe medium risk because job instability could be a stressor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a strong positive. Substance abuse and mental health issues are big risk factors, so her abstinence and mental state lower the risk.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so low risk here.\n\nShe believes God influences her life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, which are positive influences. So, low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are her young age and prior conviction, but she has several protective factors like marriage, stable upbringing, and no substance abuse. So, I think the overall prediction is low for rearrest, with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity, but being married provides stability.\"),\n    (\"prior conviction\", \"medium\", \"One conviction indicates past issues but isn't extensive.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average, not significant for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Marriage offers emotional support and stability.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is good, but not attending college might limit jobs.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Held three jobs shows employability despite potential instability.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"low\", \"Abstinence for four years is positive.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"family background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing is protective.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Beliefs provide purpose and community.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
