    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So, I'd consider age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem directly related to criminal behavior, so I'll note that as low.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could mean instability or lack of support, which might increase the risk. I'll consider this a medium factor.\n\nHe has a GED, which is a positive sign as it shows he completed his education, but not being enrolled in college might limit his opportunities. This could be a medium risk.\n\nUnemployment is a significant factor. Not having a job can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of criminal activity. So, high risk here.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over the past four years, is a concern. While it's not as severe as harder drugs, it can still impair judgment. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is a positive sign. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, so this is low.\n\nLiving with non-biological adults as a child might indicate instability in his upbringing, which can be a risk factor. I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHis religious beliefs might provide a support system and reduce recidivism, so this is a low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors lean towards a medium risk overall. However, considering the unemployment and living situation, I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't very high because some factors like education and mental health are positive.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 18 years old, he is in a high-risk age group for criminal behavior, as younger individuals are more likely to engage in impulsive actions.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"Having been arrested once but not convicted suggests some involvement in criminal activity, but the lack of conviction may indicate less severity.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which is a known risk factor for criminal recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use indicates some level of substance use, which can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone at a young age may indicate a lack of stable support systems, which can contribute to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED suggests some level of educational attainment, which can be protective against recidivism, though not being enrolled in college may limit opportunities.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
