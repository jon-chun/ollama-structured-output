    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old woman's likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 21. Younger individuals, especially those in their early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. However, 21 isn't extremely young, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests or actual convictions. So I'd say that's a low risk factor.\n\nHer living situation is alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate instability or lack of support, which might increase the risk. But it's not a strong indicator on its own, so maybe medium.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can limit job opportunities and stability. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a risk factor. However, having multiple jobs might also show she's trying to work, so maybe medium.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be a risk factor, but since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe medium.\n\nShe's felt down lately. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so that's a medium factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally stable, so maybe low.\n\nShe believes in God. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide support and reduce recidivism, so that's a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from education, medium from job instability, and mental health, but some lower factors like religion and living with family. I think the prediction is YES, but confidence isn't too high, maybe 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"21 years old is relatively young, which can be associated with higher impulsivity and risk-taking behavior, but not extremely high risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating lower risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which could increase vulnerability to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it limits opportunities and stability.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which can contribute to higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a moderate risk factor, though not as severe as harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in an urban area provides some stability, though urban environments may have higher crime exposure.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
