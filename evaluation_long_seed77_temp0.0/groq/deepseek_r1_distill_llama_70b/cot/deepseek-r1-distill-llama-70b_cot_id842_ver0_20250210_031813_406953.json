    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Having a prior record, especially multiple arrests, is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. This definitely points to a high risk factor.\n\nHis current enrollment in school is a positive sign. Education can provide structure and opportunities, reducing the likelihood of reoffending. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving alone might indicate instability or lack of support, which could increase the risk of reoffending. I'm not sure if this is high or medium. Maybe medium because it's not as severe as other factors but still a concern.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the risk. So I'd rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use, especially with marijuana and cocaine over four years, is a significant risk factor. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates, so this is high.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently is a positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this is a low risk factor.\n\nLiving with both biological parents at a young age in a stable household is a protective factor. This would lower his risk, so that's low.\n\nBelieving in God might provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor. So that's another low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are age and prior convictions and drug use. Medium factors are living alone and unstable employment. The rest are low. So overall, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest, and I'm about 80% confident.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"A history of multiple arrests and a conviction increases the likelihood of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"current_enrollment_in_school\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in school provides structure and reduces idle time, lowering recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of support system, which could increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can lead to impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of recidivism linked to mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"A stable family background with biological parents can provide support and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
