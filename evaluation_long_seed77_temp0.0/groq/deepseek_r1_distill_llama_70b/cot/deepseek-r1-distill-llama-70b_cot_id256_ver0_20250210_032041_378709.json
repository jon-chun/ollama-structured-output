    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 20-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a medium risk factor because, while not the highest, it's still a significant age where decision-making isn't fully matured.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate some involvement in criminal activity, but since there's no conviction, it's not as severe. I'd rate this as low because it's a single incident without a formal record.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a significant factor. I don't think physical build is a major contributor here, so low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Not being married at 20 isn't unusual, but the isolation could contribute to higher risk, so maybe medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of employment and education can lead to idle time and fewer opportunities, increasing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities. This seems like a high risk factor because unemployment is a known predictor of recidivism.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common, but it can still be a risk factor depending on frequency and impact on behavior. I'd say medium risk here.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed recently, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, so not feeling depressed is a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household of five. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life, which can be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community. This would be a low risk factor as it might deter criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are unemployment and lack of education. Medium factors include age, living situation, drug use, and upbringing. Protective factors are his belief and mental health. The high factors might outweigh the protective ones, leading me to predict a higher likelihood of rearrest, but I'm not extremely confident because of the mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals may have higher impulsivity and less life stability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests some involvement but not a strong criminal history.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment and lack of stable work history are strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can still contribute to impaired judgment and decision-making.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area with a larger household may expose individuals to higher crime environments.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and reduce recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
