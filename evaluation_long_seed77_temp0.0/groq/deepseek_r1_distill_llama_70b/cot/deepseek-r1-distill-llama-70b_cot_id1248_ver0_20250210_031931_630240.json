    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. I know that younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, tend to have higher recidivism rates because they might still be involved in risky behaviors or haven't yet stabilized their lives. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as multiple arrests, but it still indicates some involvement with the law. I think this is a low risk factor because it's just one incident without a conviction.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. While physical build can sometimes be a factor in certain crimes, it's not a strong indicator on its own. I don't see this as a significant risk factor, so low.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marriage and living situation can be stabilizing factors. Not being married and living with others might mean less stability, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can limit job opportunities and lead to unemployment, which is linked to higher crime rates. This seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but having multiple jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. However, having some employment is better than none, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it can still be a risk factor depending on frequency and type. Since it's marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he hasn't felt depressed, this might lower the risk. So, low.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a large household in a rural area. A stable family environment with biological parents is generally positive, but a large household might have its own challenges. Rural areas might have less access to resources, but I'm not sure how significant this is. I'll rate this as low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has control over his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not a strong indicator. I'll consider this low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factor is lack of education, which is a strong indicator. The medium factors are his age and employment instability. The rest are low. Considering these, I think the overall prediction is YES for rearrest, but my confidence isn't very high because there are only a couple of significant risk factors. Maybe around 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to potential ongoing behavioral challenges and life instability.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"low\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests limited criminal history, indicating a lower risk factor.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics alone are not strong predictors of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not being married and living with others may suggest some instability but is not a strong indicator.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it limits opportunities and can lead to unemployment.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs suggests some employment history, which can be stabilizing, though frequent job changes may indicate instability.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use is a moderate risk factor, though less severe than harder drugs.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk compared to active mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a rural area may have challenges but generally indicates a stable upbringing.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief is not a strong indicator of recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
