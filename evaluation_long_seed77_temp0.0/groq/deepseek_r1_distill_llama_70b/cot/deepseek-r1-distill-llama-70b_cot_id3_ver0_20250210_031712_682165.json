    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 18-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 18. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because their decision-making skills are still developing, and they might be more influenced by peer pressure or impulsive behaviors.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean a few things. It might indicate that he's had run-ins with the law but hasn't been found guilty, which could either mean he's innocent or perhaps the charges were dropped. However, multiple arrests do suggest some level of involvement in risky behavior, so that's a point to consider.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 180 lbs. That's pretty average, so I don't think that's a significant factor here. Physical build isn't a strong indicator of recidivism unless it's extreme, which it's not in this case.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but since he's only 18, it's not unusual for someone his age to be single. Living alone might indicate some independence, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's a risk factor. Maybe it could mean less supervision, but I'm not sure. I'll mark this as low for now.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a protective factor. It shows he's engaged in positive activities and has access to resources that can help him stay on track. This is a good sign and should lower his risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor. Frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment, which could lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in illegal activities out of necessity or frustration. However, it could also mean he's exploring different career paths, so I'm not sure. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. It can lead to impaired judgment and can be linked to criminal behavior, either through drug-seeking crimes or through associations with criminal elements. This is definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, that's a positive sign. However, if he had a history of mental health issues, that would be different. So I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size five. A larger household might indicate less individual attention, which could be a risk if it led to neglect or lack of supervision. However, it's not a strong indicator on its own. I'll mark this as low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means he doesn't have a strong support system or moral framework. However, this can vary widely among individuals, so I'm not sure. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are his young age and drug use. The medium risk factor is his job instability. The rest are low. So, considering these, I think his risk of rearrest is medium. Therefore, the prediction is YES, but my confidence isn't extremely high because there are positive factors like education that might mitigate some risks. I'll set confidence at 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to developing decision-making skills and potential impulsive behavior.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest involvement in risky behavior, though lack of convictions may indicate other factors at play.\"),\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone at 18 is common and not indicative of significant risk without additional context.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in college is a protective factor, indicating positive engagement.\"),\n    (\"job instability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes may indicate financial instability, a potential risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a significant risk factor for impaired judgment and criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No current depression is a positive sign, reducing this risk factor.\"),\n    (\"household size\", \"low\", \"Larger household size alone isn't a strong indicator without additional context.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious affiliation may indicate less support, but impact varies widely.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
