    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction might indicate that this was a first-time offense or a less severe issue. Since there's no conviction, it's not as severe as a criminal record, so I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis marital status is married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, providing emotional support and reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. This seems like a protective factor, so I'll rate it as low risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education is a protective factor against recidivism because it provides skills and opportunities. However, not pursuing higher education might limit his job prospects, so I'll assess this as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is a strong protective factor as it provides stability and income, reducing the need to engage in criminal activities. Having two jobs shows he's employable and responsible, so this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism, but since he's abstained for four years, this is a positive sign. However, he has felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe grew up in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and exposure to negative influences, which could be a risk factor. A large household might indicate less individual attention, potentially contributing to behavioral issues. I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. This would be a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age and possibly his mental health. The medium factors include his arrest history, education, living situation, and upbringing. The low factors are his marital status, employment, and religious beliefs. The protective factors seem to outweigh the risks, so I'm leaning towards a lower likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is around 65% because while there are some risks, the protective factors are strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and potential lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior arrest without conviction\", \"medium\", \"A single arrest without conviction suggests a lower risk compared to multiple convictions.\"),\n    (\"marital status\", \"low\", \"Being married and living with a spouse can provide emotional support and stability, reducing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Having a high school diploma is protective, but not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Steady employment provides stability and reduces the likelihood of criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"substance use and mental health\", \"medium\", \"Abstinence from drugs is positive, but recent depressed feelings could pose a risk if unaddressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large urban household might expose him to higher crime rates and less individual attention.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
