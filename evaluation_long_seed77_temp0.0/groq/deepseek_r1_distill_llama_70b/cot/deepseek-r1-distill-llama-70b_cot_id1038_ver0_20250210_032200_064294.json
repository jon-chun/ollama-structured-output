    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old Hispanic male regarding his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. That's interesting. Arrests without convictions might mean he's had run-ins with the law, but not necessarily found guilty. I'm thinking this could be a moderate risk factor because repeated arrests suggest some involvement in activities that lead to legal issues, even if not resulting in convictions.\n\nNext, his age is 22. Younger individuals, especially males, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So, his age might be a medium risk factor. However, he's also enrolled in a 2-year college, which could be a positive sign indicating he's trying to improve his situation, so that might lower the risk a bit.\n\nHe's living alone and has never been married. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase the risk of recidivism. On the other hand, not being married at 22 isn't necessarily a high risk factor by itself, but combined with living alone, it could contribute to a medium risk.\n\nHis education background is a GED and he's in a 2-year college. Education is usually a protective factor, so this might lower his risk. However, he's held three jobs in the past year, which could indicate instability. Job instability is a known risk factor for recidivism, so that's probably a medium risk.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has used it some time in the past month. Drug use, especially ongoing use, is a significant risk factor for recidivism. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, maybe it's a medium risk rather than high.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. Mental health issues, especially depression, can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. This could be a medium risk factor, but without more severe symptoms, maybe it's on the lower side.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five. Larger family size might not directly relate, but if it led to neglect or lack of supervision, it could be a risk. However, without more info, I'm not sure, so maybe low.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not as significant as others. Maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be his age, job instability, drug use, and mental health. These point towards a medium risk. However, his education and lack of convictions might lower it a bit. So, I'm leaning towards a medium risk prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is within a higher risk age bracket for recidivism, but not excessively high.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a GED and being enrolled in college suggests positive engagement and lower risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year indicates instability, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is less severe than harder drugs but still a risk factor.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Feeling down could indicate issues, but not severe enough for high risk without more info.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, slightly increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"arrests\", \"medium\", \"Three arrests without conviction suggest legal involvement but not necessarily guilt.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Large household size without neglect indicators is low risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious belief isn't a strong risk factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
