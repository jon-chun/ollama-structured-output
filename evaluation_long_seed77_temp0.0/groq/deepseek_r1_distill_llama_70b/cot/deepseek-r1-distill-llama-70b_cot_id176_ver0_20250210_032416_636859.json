    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing impulse control and life stability. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. Prior convictions are a strong predictor of future recidivism, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight don't immediately stand out as risk factors. Being 6'11\" and 165 lbs might make him stand out in a crowd, but unless there's a specific reason related to criminal activity, this isn't a significant factor. I'll consider this low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability and social support, which are protective factors. Without them, he might be at higher risk, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Lack of education beyond high school and unemployment are both linked to higher recidivism rates. Without a steady job, he might resort to criminal activities out of necessity or boredom. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior, either through drug-related crimes or impaired judgment. However, since it's only marijuana and not harder drugs, I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might lower his risk. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and exposure to criminal influences, which might have contributed to his past behavior. This is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide a sense of purpose and community, acting as a protective factor against recidivism. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors like his criminal history, age, unemployment, and living situation. These outweigh the protective factors like his education and religious beliefs. Therefore, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest, with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Ten arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics alone do not significantly impact recidivism risk without specific context.\"),\n    (\"marital status and living situation\", \"medium\", \"Lack of marital and family support can increase risk, though not as significantly as other factors.\"),\n    (\"education and employment\", \"high\", \"Limited education and unemployment are linked to higher recidivism rates, indicating instability.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can contribute to impaired judgment but is less severe than other substances.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces risk compared to active mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"childhood environment\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may expose individuals to higher crime environments and influences.\"),\n    (\"religious beliefs\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide protective factors against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
