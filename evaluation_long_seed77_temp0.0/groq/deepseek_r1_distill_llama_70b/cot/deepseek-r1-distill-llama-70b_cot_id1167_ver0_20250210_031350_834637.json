    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 20-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and haven't yet settled into stable life patterns. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, showing a pattern of criminal behavior. Prior convictions are a strong predictor of future offenses, so this is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that doesn't seem to pose any particular risk. I don't think physical build is a major factor here, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marriage and living with others can provide stability, so living alone might indicate a lack of support systems. This could be a medium risk factor because without a strong support network, he might be more likely to reoffend.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being in college points to limited education. Education often provides opportunities and stability, so the lack of it can increase the likelihood of recidivism. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism because it can lead to financial instability and desperation. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nDrug use, especially with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, is a significant concern. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive, but mental health can fluctuate. Since he's not currently experiencing depression, I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a large household of seven in an urban area might have exposed him to higher crime environments or less individual attention, which can increase risk. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his life might indicate a lack of spiritual support, which can be protective for some. Without this, he might not have the same coping mechanisms, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nPutting it all together, most of his risk factors are high or medium. His history of multiple arrests, lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use are strong indicators. Therefore, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest. My confidence is 85% because while the factors are strong, there's always some uncertainty in individual cases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism due to potential ongoing involvement in risky behaviors and lack of life stability.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_and_convictions\", \"high\", \"Six arrests and a conviction indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not pose a specific risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_and_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without marital support may indicate a lack of stabilizing social influences.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and increases the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment can lead to financial instability, increasing the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk compared to if mental health issues were present.\"),\n    (\"family_and_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Living in a large urban household may expose individuals to higher crime environments or less individualized attention.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of spiritual belief may reduce a potential protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
