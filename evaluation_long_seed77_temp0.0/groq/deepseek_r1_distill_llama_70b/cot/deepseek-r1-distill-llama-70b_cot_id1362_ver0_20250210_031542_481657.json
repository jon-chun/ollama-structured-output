    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 21-year-old Black male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. Younger individuals, especially males, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be in a phase of higher impulsivity and less life stability. So I'd rate age as a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested four times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had multiple run-ins with the law, but the lack of convictions might indicate that the charges weren't severe or didn't hold up. However, multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to future legal issues. So I'll consider this a medium risk factor.\n\nHis physical build is 5'10\" and 170 lbs, which is average. I don't see this as a significant risk factor either way, so low.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism. Not being married could also mean less stability, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor because it can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of engaging in criminal activities. This is a high risk factor.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Unstable employment can contribute to recidivism as it might indicate difficulty in maintaining steady work, which is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common, but it's not as severe as harder drugs. However, any drug use can still be a risk factor, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nHe's felt down recently. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk if not addressed, so this is a medium factor.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates and less resources, so this could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose and community, so this might lower his risk, making it a low factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk from education, mediums from age, arrests, living alone, employment, drug use, mental health, and upbringing, and a low from spirituality. The combination leans towards a higher risk, so I predict YES with 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism due to impulsivity and less life stability.\"),\n    (\"arrests without conviction\", \"medium\", \"Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to future legal issues, though lack of convictions may indicate less severe offenses.\"),\n    (\"physical build\", \"low\", \"Average build does not significantly contribute to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\"),\n    (\"employment stability\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can contribute to recidivism as it may indicate difficulty in maintaining steady work.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use is common but can still be a risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could increase recidivism risk if not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime rates and fewer resources.\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and community, potentially reducing recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
