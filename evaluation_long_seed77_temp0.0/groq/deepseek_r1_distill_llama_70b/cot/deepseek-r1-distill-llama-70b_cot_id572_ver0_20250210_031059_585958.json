    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 22. I remember that younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be involved in risky behaviors and might not have fully developed impulse control. So I'd rate age as a high risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses. That definitely points to a high risk factor.\n\nHis employment history shows he's held three jobs in the past year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor because it might indicate irresponsibility or an inability to maintain steady work, which could lead to engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or boredom. I think this is a medium risk factor because while it's not the most severe, it does show some instability.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially leading to situations where he might reoffend. However, having a diploma is better than not, so I'd rate this as low risk.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could indicate a lack of strong social support. Without a stable family environment, individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors. This seems like a medium risk factor because social isolation can contribute to recidivism.\n\nHis drug use includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase recidivism risk, but since he's not currently experiencing depression, this might lower his risk. I'll consider this a low risk factor.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in a rural area might have provided a stable upbringing, which is a protective factor. Rural areas might have different dynamics, but overall, a stable family background is positive. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life, which can provide a sense of purpose and accountability. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism. I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the high risk factors are his age, criminal history, and drug use. The medium factors are employment instability and living situation. The low factors are education, mental health, upbringing, and religious beliefs. \n\nConsidering the high-risk factors, especially criminal history and drug use, I think the prediction is YES for rearrest. My confidence is around 80% because while there are strong risk factors, there are also some protective elements like education and family background that might mitigate the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals, especially in their early 20s, are at a higher risk for recidivism due to potential impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"criminal history\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of future offenses.\"),\n    (\"employment instability\", \"medium\", \"Holding three jobs in a year suggests instability, which could indicate irresponsibility or difficulty maintaining steady work.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma is a protective factor, though not pursuing higher education may limit opportunities.\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never being married may indicate a lack of strong social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression suggests lower risk, as mental health issues can increase recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Living with both biological parents in a stable household is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in a higher power can provide a sense of purpose and accountability, acting as a protective factor.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
