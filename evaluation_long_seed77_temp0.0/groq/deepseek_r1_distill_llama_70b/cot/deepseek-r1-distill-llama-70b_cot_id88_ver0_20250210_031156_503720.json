    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially in their late teens to early twenties, are often still developing and might be more impulsive. This could be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is on its own. Maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has a conviction. That's a lot of arrests for someone so young. Prior criminal history is a strong predictor of recidivism. High risk here.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and 155 lbs. That's a bit underweight for his height. I don't know if body weight is a significant factor, but maybe being underweight could indicate something about his health or lifestyle. I'm not too sure, so maybe low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which can be a risk factor. Not being married could also indicate instability. Maybe medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher chances of recidivism. High risk.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor. High risk.\n\nHe's used drugs, specifically marijuana and cocaine, in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism. High risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. That's a positive, so maybe low risk for mental health issues contributing to recidivism.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments might have higher crime rates, so maybe medium risk. Living with his mother could provide some stability, but urban areas can have more challenges.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective, providing a support system or moral framework. So maybe low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, he has several high-risk factors: prior arrests, lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use. These are strong indicators. Despite some lower risks, the high ones dominate. So I predict YES for rearrest, with high confidence, maybe 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to ongoing development and potential impulsivity.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Ten prior arrests indicate a significant history of criminal behavior, which is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Being underweight may indicate potential health issues but is not a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can indicate a lack of social support, which may increase the likelihood of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and is associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unstable employment history is a known risk factor for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant predictor of recidivism as it can lead to further criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent feelings of depression reduce the risk of mental health-related recidivism.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in an urban area may expose individuals to higher crime environments, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide a protective factor against recidivism by offering moral guidance and support.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
