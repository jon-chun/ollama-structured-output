    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male to predict his likelihood of rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals, especially those in their late teens to early twenties, are statistically more likely to engage in risky behaviors. So, age is a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that's concerning. This definitely points to a high risk.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem particularly relevant here, so I'll mark that as low.\n\nLiving alone and never being married could indicate a lack of stable social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. That's a medium risk.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not being enrolled in college suggests limited education and possibly fewer opportunities, which can lead to higher recidivism. That's a high risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year, which might indicate instability in employment. Unstable employment can contribute to higher recidivism, so that's a medium risk.\n\nDrug use, especially with marijuana and cocaine over the past four years, is a significant factor. Substance abuse is a known contributor to criminal behavior, so that's high risk.\n\nNo recent feelings of depression might lower the risk associated with mental health issues, so that's low.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of size four at a young age doesn't immediately stand out as a high-risk factor, so I'll consider that low.\n\nBelieving that God has a role in his life might provide some stabilizing influence, which could be protective, so that's low.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors like age, prior arrests, education level, and drug use are significant. The medium factors like living situation and employment instability add to the risk. The low-risk factors might help a bit but aren't enough to outweigh the others. So, I predict a high likelihood of rearrest, with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals are at a higher risk of recidivism due to impulsivity and ongoing development.\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Three prior arrests indicate a pattern of behavior that may lead to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics are not indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate limited social support, which can increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED suggests limited opportunities and higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Job instability may contribute to financial stress and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces the risk associated with mental health issues.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Living with biological mother in a stable household reduces risk.\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may provide a protective factor against recidivism.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
