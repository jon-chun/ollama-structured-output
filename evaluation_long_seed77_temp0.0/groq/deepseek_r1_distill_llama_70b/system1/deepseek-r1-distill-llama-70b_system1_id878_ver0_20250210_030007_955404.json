    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors depending on other variables, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are significant because they can indicate a history of engaging in risky or illegal behavior, which might point to a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'10\" and 135 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but unless there's a health concern, this might not be a major risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 isn't unusual, but it could indicate a lack of strong social support, which might be a risk factor for various issues.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and is often linked to higher risks of unemployment, poverty, and other social issues.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other personal challenges.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to addiction, legal problems, and other health issues.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive, but the absence of depression doesn't necessarily offset other risk factors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four when young. A stable family environment can be protective, but without more details, it's hard to assess the impact here.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his personal life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, but again, without context, it's hard to gauge the impact.\n\nPutting it all together, the history of arrests, convictions, drug use, lack of education, and job instability are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like living alone and young age might not be as significant on their own, combined with the others, they contribute to an overall high-risk assessment. I'm about 85% confident in this prediction because the combination of legal history, substance use, and socioeconomic factors are strong predictors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
