    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean she's had run-ins with the law, but no convictions might lower the risk since it didn't lead to a guilty verdict. However, multiple arrests could indicate a pattern.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'6\" and 180 lbs. That gives her a BMI around 30, which is obese. Obesity can lead to health issues, which might be a risk factor for certain outcomes, but I'm not sure how it ties into behavioral or legal risk.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 21 isn't unusual, but it might indicate independence or possible isolation. Not being married at a young age isn't a significant risk factor on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is generally a positive factor, showing she's pursuing further education, which might lower risk factors related to unemployment or instability.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability can be a factor; having two jobs might indicate she's working hard, but frequent job changes could also suggest instability. Without knowing the reasons, it's hard to assess.\n\nDrug use: She's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other behavioral problems. Recent use, especially cocaine, is more concerning than marijuana.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase risk factors for various negative outcomes, including substance abuse.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area with a household of five. A stable family background with both parents is a protective factor, but urban environments can have higher crime rates and other risks. Household size might relate to socioeconomic status, but again, without more info, it's neutral.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: The significant risk factors here are the drug use, especially cocaine, and the recent feelings of depression. These can contribute to higher risk behaviors. The arrests without convictions and job changes are moderate factors. Her educational pursuit and stable upbringing are positive. So, overall, there are some concerning factors, but they might not be at the highest risk level yet. I'd say the prediction is YES for high risk, but the confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are mitigated by her education and family background.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"arrests without conviction\", \"feelings of depression\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
