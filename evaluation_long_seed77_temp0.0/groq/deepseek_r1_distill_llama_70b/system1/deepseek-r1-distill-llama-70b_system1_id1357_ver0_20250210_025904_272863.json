    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not definitive.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A criminal history is a known risk factor, but only one arrest and conviction might not be a strong indicator on its own. It depends on the nature of the offense, which isn't provided here.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'4\" and 145 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height. This could indicate possible health issues, which might relate to other factors like substance use or mental health.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which can be a risk factor for various issues, including recidivism or mental health struggles.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower stability, but having a GED is better than not having one.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to higher risk factors like financial instability or personal issues.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some recent use. Drug use is a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues. However, marijuana is generally considered less severe than other drugs.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are significant risk factors for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five in an urban area. Larger households might indicate less individual attention, and urban areas can have higher crime rates or more exposure to risk factors.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, drug use, mental health issues, and living alone are notable. However, the criminal history is limited, and he has some positive factors like a GED and religious beliefs. The mental health aspect is concerning but not severe enough on its own without more information.\n\nI think the risk is present but not extremely high. So, prediction is YES, but confidence isn't too high, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 4 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
