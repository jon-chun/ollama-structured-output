    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not definitive on its own. Next, he's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, so that's a point towards higher risk.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and 145 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong indicators of risk, so I'll note that but not give it much weight.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not a strong indicator. Being enrolled in school is actually a positive factor because education can reduce recidivism.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, so having a job might lower the risk, but only having one job could indicate instability, so that's a bit of a mixed signal.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to impaired judgment and contribute to criminal behavior. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a small household, which is a stable upbringing, a positive factor. He also believes in God, which can provide emotional support and reduce risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrests and convictions are concerning, as is the drug use. However, he's in school and has a job, which are positive. His stable upbringing and religious beliefs also lower the risk. So, while there are some risk factors, the positives might balance them out. I'm leaning towards a lower risk prediction, maybe 40% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"living alone\", \"young age\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
