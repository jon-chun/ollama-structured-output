    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs between 100-124 lbs. That's within a normal weight range, so I don't see that as a risk factor. She's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect risk, but not living alone might mean she has a support system, which could be a protective factor.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive sign as it indicates she's engaged in education and possibly has structure in her life. She's held two jobs in the past year, which shows some stability, though job changes can sometimes indicate instability, but two jobs in a year isn't too bad.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is relatively common and while it can be a risk factor, especially if frequent, it's not as severe as harder drugs. She's felt down several times in the past month, which could indicate some mental health issues like depression. That's a significant risk factor because mental health can impact other areas of life.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a large household of 8 in a rural area. A stable family background with both parents is generally a protective factor, though a large household might have its own challenges. However, rural areas might have less access to resources, which could be a risk.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk if it means she doesn't have a support system, but it's not a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the main concerns are the arrest (though no conviction), marijuana use, and recent feelings of depression. These could indicate some level of risk, but they aren't extremely severe. The protective factors like being in school and having a stable upbringing balance this out. So, I don't think it's a high risk situation. My confidence is around 70% because while there are some risk factors, they aren't overwhelming.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"marijuana use\", \"recent feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
