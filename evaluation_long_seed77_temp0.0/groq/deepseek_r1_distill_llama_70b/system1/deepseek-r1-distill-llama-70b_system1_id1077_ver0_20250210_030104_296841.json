    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being Hispanic alone isn't necessarily a risk factor. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate some issues, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 285 lbs. That's quite heavy, which could relate to health issues, but not directly a risk factor for behavior. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 20 isn't unusual, but not having a strong support system might be a concern.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment or lower socioeconomic status, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors. He's held only one job in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background might be a protective factor, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or exposure to negative influences. He believes God influences his life, which might provide some emotional support or protective effect.\n\nPutting it all together, the lack of education, limited employment, drug use, and mental health concerns are significant risk factors. However, the absence of convictions and a stable family background might lower the risk a bit. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but the confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are mitigated.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 20-year-old male\",\n    \"Ethnicity: Hispanic\",\n    \"Arrests: 2 times but no convictions\",\n    \"Height and Weight: 6 feet 0 inches, 285 lbs\",\n    \"Marital Status: Never married, living alone\",\n    \"Education: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college\",\n    \"Employment: Held 1 job during the year\",\n    \"Drug Use: Used marijuana in the past four years\",\n    \"Mental Health: Felt down in the dumps some of the time during the past month\",\n    \"Family Background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area at a young age\",\n    \"Religious Beliefs: Believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
