    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but I'm not sure how race plays into this beyond potential systemic issues.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean a few things\u2014maybe he's had run-ins with the law but hasn't been found guilty, which might indicate either innocence or perhaps ongoing issues that haven't led to convictions yet. This could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 255 lbs. That's a large build, which might be relevant in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but on its own, it's not a direct risk factor unless we're assessing for violence or something similar.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate social isolation, which can be a risk factor for mental health issues or other behaviors. Not being married at 21 isn't unusual, though.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lack of education can limit opportunities, increase unemployment, and potentially lead to higher risk behaviors due to fewer options.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana is common, but chronic use can still have implications, especially if it's affecting his life. However, it's not as severe as harder drugs.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors for various negative outcomes, including substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of nine in an urban area. Large household size might indicate overcrowding or less individual attention, which can be a risk factor. Urban areas can have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but it depends on the individual. For some, it might mean less social support or different coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of education, job instability, drug use, mental health issues, and living situation all point towards higher risk factors. However, the arrests without convictions and the drug use being marijuana (which is less severe) might lower the confidence a bit. So, I think the prediction is YES, but the confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested 2 times\", \"no high school diploma\", \"unstable job history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"large household\", \"urban upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
