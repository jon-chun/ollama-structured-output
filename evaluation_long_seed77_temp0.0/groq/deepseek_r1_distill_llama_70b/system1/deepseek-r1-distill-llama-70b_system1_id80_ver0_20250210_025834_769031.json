    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested three times but hasn't been convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate some issues, but without knowing the context of the arrests, it's hard to gauge the severity. Maybe she's had some run-ins with the law, but no convictions could mean the charges were dropped or she wasn't found guilty.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 134 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side for her height, but not significantly so. BMI-wise, that's about 25.5, which is just into the overweight category. Not a major risk factor unless there are other health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 20 is pretty common, and living situation can vary. Not living alone might mean she has a support system, which could be a protective factor.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having a diploma, but not being in college might limit her future opportunities, which could be a risk factor for economic stability.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Job stability can be a risk factor. Only having one job might indicate she's either just starting her career or had issues with employment, which could relate to financial instability.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a bigger risk factor, so this is good.\n\nShe's felt down some of the time in the past month. This could indicate mild depression or stress, but it's not at a level that's debilitating. However, mental health issues can be a risk factor if they're severe or persistent.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size four when young. A stable family environment can be protective, so this might not be a risk factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personally. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main potential risk factors are the arrests without convictions, limited job stability, and mild depressive symptoms. However, the absence of drug use and a stable living situation are protective factors. The risk doesn't seem high enough to warrant a \"YES\" prediction. So, I'll go with \"NO\" and a moderate confidence level, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested 3 times without conviction\", \"held 1 job in the past year\", \"some feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
