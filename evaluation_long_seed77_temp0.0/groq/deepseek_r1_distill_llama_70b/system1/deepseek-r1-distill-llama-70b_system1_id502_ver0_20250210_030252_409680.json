    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs between 175-199 lbs. Her weight could be a health concern, possibly indicating obesity, which has its own risks, but I'm not sure how that ties into the overall risk assessment unless it's related to other factors.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at a young age might indicate independence, but it could also suggest isolation or limited support systems. Not being married isn't a risk factor per se, but combined with living alone, it might contribute to other issues.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect socioeconomic status and opportunities, which might influence risk factors, but again, not directly a high-risk indicator.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate financial instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which can lead to other issues.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down some of the time in the past month. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with mental health issues. Feeling down could indicate depression or other mental health concerns, which can increase risk if not addressed.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a small household in a rural area. Rural areas might have less access to resources, which could be a risk factor. Living with only her mother might not be a risk, but depending on the family dynamics, it could contribute.\n\nShe believes God influences her personal events. This could be a coping mechanism or a support system, which might reduce risk factors by providing emotional support.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors seem to be the arrest (though no conviction), job instability, drug use, and possible mental health issues. However, she has a high school diploma and a belief system that might provide support. The lack of conviction and the presence of support systems might lower the overall risk. So, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not high. Therefore, the prediction would be \"NO\" with a confidence level around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest without conviction\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\", \"possible mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
