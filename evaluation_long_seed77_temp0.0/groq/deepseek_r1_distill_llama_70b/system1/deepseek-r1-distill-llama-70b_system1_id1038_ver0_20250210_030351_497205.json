    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher risk behaviors. Next, he's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but no formal charges stuck. That might suggest some risky behavior but not necessarily a conviction history.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 165 lbs, which is average build, so nothing stands out there. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate independence, but it might also mean less social support, which can be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a positive factor, but maybe he's not completing things or it's a recent enrollment. He's held three jobs in a year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some of the past month he felt down. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five, which is a larger family. Depending on the environment, this could be neutral or a slight risk if it was unstable. He doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life, which might affect his support system or coping mechanisms, but this is more about personal belief and not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, job instability, drug use, and possible mental health issues are the main risk factors. However, he's enrolled in college, which is a positive. The lack of convictions and ongoing education might lower the risk. So, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not high. Confidence is around 60% because while there are concerning factors, there are also mitigating ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
