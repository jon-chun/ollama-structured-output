    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to societal factors, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be a strong indicator, but it could suggest some involvement in activities that led to legal issues, which might be a risk factor.\n\nHer height and weight: 5'9\" and 275 lbs. That gives her a BMI in the obese category. Obesity can lead to health risks like diabetes or heart issues, which could be a concern.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate independence, but it could also mean limited social support, which might be a risk factor for mental health.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a positive factor, suggesting stability and better opportunities, which might lower risk.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Job stability can be a risk factor; frequent job changes or unemployment might indicate instability, but having one job could mean she's employed, which is positive.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some drug use in the past month. Drug use can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or if it's impacting her life. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, but it's still a consideration.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or mental health issues, which are significant risk factors if not addressed.\n\nShe grew up in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and other stressors, which might contribute to risk factors. A large household might mean less individual attention or resources, which could be a risk.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk by offering a sense of community and purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: The mental health issues (feeling down) and drug use are significant. However, she's enrolled in college and has a job, which are positive. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. Obesity is a health risk. Urban upbringing and living alone might contribute, but her education and employment are mitigating factors.\n\nI think the mental health and drug use are the main risks here. They could indicate a higher risk, but her stable education and employment might lower the overall risk. So, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not extremely high. Maybe a confidence level around 60% for indicating some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"obesity\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
