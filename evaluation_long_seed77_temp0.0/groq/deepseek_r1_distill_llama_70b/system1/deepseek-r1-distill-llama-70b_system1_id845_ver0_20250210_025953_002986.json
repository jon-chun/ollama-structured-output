    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or other risks.\n\nShe's 5'4\" and weighs 130 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk factors unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be. Being married and living with her spouse could be a stabilizing factor, which might lower risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. She's held one job in the past year, which might indicate some instability, but it's not a major red flag.\n\nDrug use is a key factor here. She's used marijuana in the past four years and used it all the time in the past month. Frequent drug use can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues, health problems, and impaired judgment.\n\nShe's felt down for the past month, which could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase risk factors, especially if left untreated. Her living situation as a child with her biological mother in a household of five might not be a significant risk factor unless there were other adverse conditions, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of community.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the criminal history and recent drug use, along with possible mental health issues. However, she has some stabilizing factors like being married and having a high school diploma. The drug use and mental health are concerning, but without more severe indicators, the overall risk might not be extremely high. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a prediction of \"YES\" with a confidence around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year.
