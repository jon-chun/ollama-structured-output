Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 160 lbs. His height and weight don't immediately stand out as risk factors unless we're considering something specific, but in general, they don't indicate high risk.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of strong social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being enrolled in college doesn't necessarily indicate risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or interferes with life. However, since it's only mentioned as past use, it's not clear if it's ongoing.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of depression is a positive indicator, so that's a good sign.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban area can have its challenges, but living with a biological parent is generally a stable environment.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks, acting as a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest, job instability, and past drug use. However, the absence of conviction, lack of depression, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs are protective factors. The risk seems moderate but not high. So, I would predict \"NO\" with a confidence level around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"held 3 jobs in a year\", \"past marijuana use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
