    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but I'm not sure how race plays into this beyond potential systemic issues.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which could indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 175-199 lbs. That's average, so probably not a risk factor unless in specific contexts, but I don't see how that's relevant here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including recidivism.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher risk of unemployment and recidivism. Education often provides stability and opportunities, so lacking it could be a risk.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment is a known risk factor for recidivism. It suggests he might not have a steady income, leading to potential illegal activities.\n\nDrug use in the past four years with marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism and other negative outcomes. It can impair judgment and lead to illegal activities to support a habit.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive, but mental health can fluctuate. However, the absence of depression might lower some risks, but other factors are more concerning.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Large household size might indicate overcrowding or less attention, and urban areas can have higher crime rates, exposing him to more risks.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but it depends on the individual. Without a strong support system, it might not contribute much to risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, unstable employment, lack of education, drug use, and living alone are all significant risk factors. His age and living situation add to the context. While not feeling depressed is a positive, the other factors outweigh it. So, I think the prediction is YES for high risk. Confidence is high, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"unstable employment\", \"lack of education\", \"drug use\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
