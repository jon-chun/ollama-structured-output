    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Hispanic might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can indicate a higher risk of reoffending, depending on the nature of the offense. However, since it's only one arrest and conviction, I'm not sure how severe it is.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 175-199 lbs. That's average, so probably not a risk factor unless in specific contexts, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors. Not being married at 19 is pretty common, so that alone isn't a big issue.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college and hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a risk factor because it might lead to financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug. Recent use in the past month could indicate ongoing issues.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. That could point to mental health issues like depression, which is another risk factor if left untreated.\n\nHe grew up in a large household in an urban area with his biological mother. A large household might mean less individual attention, but urban areas can have higher crime rates, which might expose him to more risks.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor if it provides him with a support system or positive outlook.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, unemployment, drug use, mental health issues, and living alone are all risk factors. However, his belief and having a high school diploma might be protective. The drug use and mental health are concerning, but without knowing the severity of his criminal history, it's a bit balanced. I'm leaning towards high risk but not extremely high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
