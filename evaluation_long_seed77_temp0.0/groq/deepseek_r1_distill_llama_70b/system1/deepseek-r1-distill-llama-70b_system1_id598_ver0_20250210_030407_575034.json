    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk for certain behaviors, but age alone isn't a strong indicator. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can correlate with higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and 160 lbs. Physical characteristics don't really play into risk assessment much, so I can probably ignore that. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not too strong on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but again, not a major risk factor. He's held one job in the past year. Employment history can be a stabilizing factor, but only having one job might suggest some instability, though it's not a huge red flag.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor because it can lead to dependency, impaired judgment, and engagement in risky behaviors. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, which lowers risk. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor if it means less social support, but it's not a major indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the criminal history and drug use. However, he has some protective factors like a stable upbringing and no current depression. The other factors are either neutral or not strong indicators. So, while there are some risks, they might not be high enough to warrant a \"YES\" prediction. I'm leaning towards \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
