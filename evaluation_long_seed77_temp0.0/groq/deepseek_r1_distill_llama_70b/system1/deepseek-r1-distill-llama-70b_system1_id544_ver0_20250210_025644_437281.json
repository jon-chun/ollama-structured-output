    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. I know that being young and male can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but I'm not sure how significant race is here. Maybe it's more about societal factors rather than an inherent risk.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a higher risk, especially if they're frequent. This might suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 2 inches and 215 lbs. I'm not sure how physical size relates to risk factors. Maybe in certain contexts, but on its own, it doesn't seem like a strong indicator.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might not be unusual, but not being married could indicate less social stability, which sometimes is linked to higher risk factors.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not having higher education can limit opportunities and might be associated with higher risk if it leads to unemployment or lower socioeconomic status.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might indicate difficulty maintaining employment, which can lead to financial instability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues. However, since he hasn't felt depressed recently, that might lower the risk related to mental health.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a large household might indicate less individual attention, which could contribute to risk factors.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but it depends on the individual. Without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests and convictions are significant. The job instability and drug use also add to the risk. However, the absence of recent depression and having a GED might slightly lower the risk. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but I'm not 100% confident. Maybe around 80% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
