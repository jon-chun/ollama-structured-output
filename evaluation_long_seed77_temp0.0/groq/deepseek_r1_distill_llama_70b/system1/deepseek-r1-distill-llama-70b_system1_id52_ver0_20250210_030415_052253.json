    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in risky or illegal behavior, which could indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'6\" and 146 lbs. That's average and doesn't seem relevant to risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate some level of independence, but not necessarily a risk factor. Not being married is common at his age.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a red flag. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, leading to higher risks of unemployment, lower income, and potentially engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other personal issues, increasing risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially if frequent, can be a risk factor. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, but it's still a consideration.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's positive; lack of depression could lower some risks associated with mental health issues.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five. Larger family size might relate to socioeconomic status or support systems, but without more context, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could provide a support system and reduce certain risks, as religious beliefs can be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, job instability, and drug use are significant risk factors. However, his mental health seems stable, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The confidence level is high because several factors point to elevated risk, but not all are extreme.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED\", \"Job instability\", \"Drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
