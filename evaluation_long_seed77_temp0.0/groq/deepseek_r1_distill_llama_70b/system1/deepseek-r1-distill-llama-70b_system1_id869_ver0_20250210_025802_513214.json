    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 128 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically indicate risk unless there's something unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 18 is normal, and living situation might relate to stability, but not necessarily a high risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college could be a neutral factor.\n\nShe's held one job in the past year. Employment history can indicate stability; having one job isn't bad, but maybe limited work experience could be a consideration.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is relatively common and might not be a high risk unless it's frequent or problematic. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign regarding mental health.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults as a child in a large household. Unstable living situations can be a risk factor, but it's just one part of her history.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and aren't typically a risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors here don't strongly indicate high risk. The arrest without conviction and living situation might be minor concerns, but overall, the factors don't point to a high risk. So, I would predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 18\",\n    \"Gender: Female\",\n    \"Race: White\",\n    \"Arrested once, not convicted\",\n    \"Height: 5 feet 5 inches\",\n    \"Weight: 128 lbs\",\n    \"Never married\",\n    \"Not living alone\",\n    \"High school diploma\",\n    \"Not enrolled in college\",\n    \"Held 1 job in the past year\",\n    \"Drug use (marijuana) in the past four years\",\n    \"No depression in the past month\",\n    \"Lived with non-biological adults as a child\",\n    \"Believes God influences personal events\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
