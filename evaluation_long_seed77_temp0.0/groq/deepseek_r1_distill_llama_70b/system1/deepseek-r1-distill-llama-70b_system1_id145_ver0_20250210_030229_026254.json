    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement in risky behavior, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 215 lbs. That's a large build, which might be relevant in certain contexts, like physical altercations, but on its own, it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for some behaviors, but it's not definitive. Having a high school diploma and being enrolled in a 4-year college is a positive factor, suggesting he's engaged in education, which usually correlates with lower risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate some issues, maybe with commitment or reliability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more serious issues. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, reducing risk. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's not a strong indicator.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the drug use and job instability. However, he's in college, which is a positive, and he comes from a stable home. The lack of convictions and no recent depression are also positives. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't strongly indicate a high risk overall. I'd say the prediction is NO with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
