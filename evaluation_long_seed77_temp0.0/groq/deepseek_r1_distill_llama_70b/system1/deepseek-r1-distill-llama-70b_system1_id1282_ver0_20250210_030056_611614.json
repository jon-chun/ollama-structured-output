    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which could point to a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 180 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side for his height, but unless there's a specific health concern, this might not be a major risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 isn't unusual, but it could indicate a lack of strong social support, which might be a risk factor for various issues.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and increase the risk of unemployment, poverty, and other social issues. This is a significant risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment, especially prolonged, can lead to financial instability, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including criminal behavior or mental health issues.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana is legal in some places, frequent use can still be a risk factor, especially if it's affecting his life negatively. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is a positive sign regarding his mental health.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults as a child in an urban area. Unstable living conditions and non-traditional upbringing can be risk factors for behavioral issues and other problems later in life.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his personal life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests, lack of education, unemployment, and unstable living situation are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like his religious beliefs might mitigate risk, the overall picture leans towards high risk. I'm about 85% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unemployment\", \"Unstable living situation\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
