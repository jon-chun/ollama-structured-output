    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. Age and race can sometimes be factors, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean less life experience, but that's not inherently risky.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior, so this does raise some flags.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and between 175-199 lbs. That's pretty average for a male, so I don't see that as a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor, but not being married at 20 is pretty common and not necessarily risky on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college might limit future prospects, but it's not a direct risk indicator.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job stability can be a factor; having only one job might indicate some instability, but it's not a strong indicator without more context.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive. No recent substance abuse or mental health issues reduces risk factors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size three. A smaller household might mean more individual attention, which is generally positive, so this isn't a risk factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and structure, which is a protective factor against risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor is the criminal history. However, the other factors like stable mental health, education, and religious beliefs are positive. So, while there's some risk, it's not extremely high. I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
