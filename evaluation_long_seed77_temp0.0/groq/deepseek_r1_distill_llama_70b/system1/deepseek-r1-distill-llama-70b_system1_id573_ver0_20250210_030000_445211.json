    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'9\" and weighs between 125-149 lbs. That's within a normal weight range, so no obvious health red flags there. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some independence, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a positive factor, suggesting stability and lower risk. She's held one job during the year, which is pretty standard for a college student and doesn't raise any red flags.\n\nNow, she has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use, especially cocaine, can be a significant risk factor. It's associated with higher risks of various negative outcomes, so this is a point against her.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues can increase risk, but the absence here is a good sign. She lived with adoptive parents in an urban area as a child. Adoption itself isn't a risk factor, but growing up in an urban area might have different influences compared to rural areas, but it's not a clear indicator.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. This could relate to her support systems or coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor unless it's linked to other issues.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor here is the drug use. However, she's in college, has a job, and no recent mental health issues. The lack of conviction and positive educational and employment status might mitigate the risk from drug use. So, while there's some risk, it's not extremely high. I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
