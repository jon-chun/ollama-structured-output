    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male from an American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut background. I know that certain demographics can have higher risk profiles due to societal factors, but I'm not sure how significant this is on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions are definitely risk factors, especially if they're recent. This could indicate a pattern of behavior that might lead to reoffending.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'2\" and 160 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height, which might indicate possible health issues or neglect, but I'm not sure how this ties into risk assessment directly.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone, especially at a young age, might suggest social isolation, which can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including mental health issues or substance abuse.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for unemployment, poverty, and potentially criminal behavior. It limits opportunities and can lead to a cycle of poverty.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor. It can lead to financial instability, which might drive someone to engage in risky behaviors, including crime or substance abuse.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some of the time in the past month felt down. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent. Feeling down could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which can increase risk if not addressed.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban area might expose someone to higher crime rates or environmental risks, but living with both parents could be a stabilizing factor, which might lower risk compared to broken homes.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors like substance abuse or criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: the convictions, unemployment, lack of education, drug use, and possible mental health issues are strong indicators of high risk. While living with both parents and religious beliefs might mitigate some risk, the other factors are significant. I'm about 85% confident this indicates high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"age\", \"arrests\", \"convictions\", \"lack_of_education\", \"unemployment\", \"drug_use\", \"mental_health_issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
