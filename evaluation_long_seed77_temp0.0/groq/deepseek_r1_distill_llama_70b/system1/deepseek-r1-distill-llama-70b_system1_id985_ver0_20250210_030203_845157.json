    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior. \n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 170 lbs. His height and weight don't immediately stand out as risk factors unless we're considering physical strength, but that's not directly linked to recidivism without other context.\n\nHe's married but living alone. Marriage can sometimes be a stabilizing factor, but living alone might indicate social isolation, which could be a risk factor. However, it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can affect employment opportunities, which in turn can influence recidivism. Not having a job in the past year is a red flag because unemployment is a known risk factor for reoffending.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive because substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors, and their absence lowers the risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but without more context, it's hard to weigh this heavily.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide a support system, but the absence doesn't necessarily increase risk unless it's linked to other factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are his criminal history and unemployment. However, the absence of drug use and mental health issues, along with a stable upbringing, are protective factors. The other factors like age, marital status, and living situation are less significant. So, while there are some risks, they aren't overwhelming. I'd say the confidence is around 40% that these factors indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}\n```",
