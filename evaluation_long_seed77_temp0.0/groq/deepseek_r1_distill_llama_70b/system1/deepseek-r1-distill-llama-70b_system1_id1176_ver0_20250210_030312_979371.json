    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but being young might indicate less life experience. He's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can point to a higher risk, especially if they're recent or related to serious offenses.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 160 lbs. Physical characteristics don't usually indicate risk unless in extreme cases, which this isn't. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities and is often linked to higher risk of recidivism or other negative outcomes. He's held only one job in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is a positive sign. However, he's felt down recently, which could indicate mental health issues. Depression can increase risk if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, and a large household might mean less individual attention. He doesn't believe God influences his life, which might affect his support system or coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: young, convicted, limited education, unstable employment, recent depression, and a challenging upbringing. These factors do suggest a higher risk, but the absence of recent drug use is a mitigating factor. So, I'd predict high risk but with moderate confidence because some factors are positive.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"young age\", \"arrests and conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"unstable employment\", \"recent depression\", \"challenging upbringing\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
