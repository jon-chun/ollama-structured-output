    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. So, that's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. So, that's a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 220 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, body size alone isn't a direct risk factor unless it's used in a harmful way. So, probably low risk here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 isn't unusual, and not being married at this age is common. So, that's neutral.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school. Being in school is generally a positive factor, indicating stability and engagement. So, that's a low risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs could indicate instability or perhaps a good work ethic. Without more context, it's hard to say, but it might lean towards moderate risk if job instability is a concern.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and, while it can be a concern, it's not as severe as other drugs. So, that's a low to moderate risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Lack of recent depression is a positive sign. So, that's low risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a rural area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so that's low risk.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors. So, that's low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and job changes. However, the lack of conviction, enrollment in school, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs are positive factors that mitigate risk. So, overall, the risk isn't high. The confidence is around 85% because while there are some factors, the positives outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"held 2 jobs in the past year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
