    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Her race doesn't particularly indicate a risk here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior, so this might lean towards higher risk. However, it's just one arrest and conviction, so I need to consider the context. What was she arrested for? The details aren't provided, so I can't weigh it too heavily, but it's still a point to note.\n\nHer physical characteristics: 5 feet 3 inches and 125-149 lbs. This doesn't seem relevant to risk assessment unless it's related to health, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships can be a protective factor, reducing risk. It suggests a support system, which is positive.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a base level of education. Not attending college doesn't necessarily increase risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate instability or issues with employment. However, at 20, she might still be figuring out her career path, so this isn't too alarming.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. These are positive indicators. Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant risk factors, and their absence lowers the risk.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Growing up in an urban area might have its challenges, but without more context, it's hard to say. Overall, a stable upbringing is a good sign.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Spiritual beliefs can provide emotional support and reduce risk factors related to mental health or behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest and conviction are the main risk factors, but they're mitigated by her stable marriage, lack of substance abuse, stable upbringing, and positive mental health. The job changes are a minor concern but not a major risk. Overall, the protective factors seem to outweigh the risks, so I would predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once and convicted\", \"held 3 jobs in the past year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
