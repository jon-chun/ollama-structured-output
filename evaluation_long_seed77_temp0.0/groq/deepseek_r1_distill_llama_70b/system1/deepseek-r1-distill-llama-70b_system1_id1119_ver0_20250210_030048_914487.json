    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher risk behaviors, but race alone isn't a risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested six times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had multiple run-ins with the law, but no formal charges stuck. This might indicate a higher risk of reoffending or being in risky situations.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'2\" and 140 lbs. That's quite underweight for his height. Could indicate possible health issues or neglect, which might tie into other factors like substance use or mental health.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can limit opportunities, potentially leading to higher risk of unemployment or engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of risky behaviors, including criminal activity or substance abuse.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years and used all the time in the past month. Frequent drug use is a significant risk factor for various negative outcomes, including health issues, legal problems, and impaired judgment.\n\nHe's felt down for the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are risk factors for self-harm, substance abuse, or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size four. Larger household size might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to assess. It could mean more support or more stress, depending on the situation.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose, which might reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, unemployment, lack of education, recent heavy drug use, and possible mental health issues are all significant risk factors. However, his belief in God might act as a protective factor. The confidence level is high because several factors point towards high risk, but not 100% because of the potential mitigating effect of his beliefs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests\", \"unemployment\", \"lack of education\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and all of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 4. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
