    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can indicate a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 155 lbs. That's within a normal range, so probably not a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might suggest some level of independence, but it could also indicate social isolation, which can be a risk factor for mental health issues.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socioeconomic challenges, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other underlying problems.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and some of the time in the past month felt down. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other substance use or mental health issues. Feeling down could indicate depression or other mental health concerns.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risks, but living with a biological parent is generally a stable factor.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and reducing risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, lack of education, job instability, drug use, and possible mental health issues are all risk factors. However, his religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The presence of multiple risk factors, especially criminal history and mental health indicators, leans towards a higher risk assessment. But I'm not 100% confident because some factors like living with a biological parent and religious beliefs could lower the risk. So, I'll predict high risk with 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
