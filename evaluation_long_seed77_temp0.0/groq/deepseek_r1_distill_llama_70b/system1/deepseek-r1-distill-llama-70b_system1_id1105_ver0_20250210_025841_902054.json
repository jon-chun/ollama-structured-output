    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean the charges were dropped or dismissed, which might lower the risk compared to a conviction. So this is a moderate factor.\n\nHer height and weight are average, so no risk there. Not being married and not living alone\u2014living with others might provide support, which could lower risk factors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college. Education is generally a positive factor, associated with lower risk. However, having held 4 jobs in a year could indicate instability, which might be a risk factor.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and while it can be a risk factor, especially if frequent, it's not as severe as harder drugs. She hasn't felt depressed recently, which is positive.\n\nShe grew up in a large household (7 people) in an urban area with her biological mother. Large families can sometimes have stress, but urban areas might offer more resources. Living with her mother is a stable factor.\n\nShe doesn't believe God influences her life. This could relate to coping mechanisms; some people find support through religion, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the job instability and past drug use are moderate risk factors, but education, lack of depression, and stable living situation are positive. The arrest without conviction is a point but not too severe. So overall, the risk is moderate, but not high. I'll predict \"NO\" with 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"held 4 jobs in a year\", \"past marijuana use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
