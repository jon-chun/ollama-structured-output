    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age and ethnicity alone aren't strong indicators, but being young might relate to higher impulsivity. Next, he's been arrested 9 times and has a conviction. That's a significant number of arrests, which suggests a pattern of behavior that could be risky or problematic.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and 180 lbs. While this might be relevant in certain contexts, like physical risk, it's not directly a risk factor for recidivism or other behavioral risks. His marital status is single, living alone. Being unmarried and living alone might indicate less social support, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors.\n\nHe has a GED and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education can be a protective factor, showing he's trying to improve his situation. However, he's held only 2 jobs in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a risk factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years and has felt down recently. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other behaviors. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which if untreated, might increase risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is usually a protective factor, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or exposure to negative influences. He believes God influences his life, which might provide emotional support and could be a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of high risk. Unstable employment and drug use add to that. However, his education and family background might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards high risk but not with complete certainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Unstable employment history\", \"Drug use\", \"Recent feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a GED certificate and is enrolled in a 2-year college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
