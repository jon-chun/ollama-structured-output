    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender might not be significant on their own, but they can influence other factors. Being young might mean she's still developing and could be more susceptible to certain risks.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests and convictions can indicate a history of engaging in risky or illegal behavior, which might point to a higher risk level. The number of arrests is moderate, but the fact that she has a conviction suggests that her actions were serious enough to warrant legal consequences.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 4 inches, and she weighs 272 lbs. This gives her a high BMI, which is in the obese category. Obesity is linked to various health risks, including diabetes, heart disease, and mobility issues. This could be a significant risk factor for health-related problems.\n\nShe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of social support, which can be a risk factor for mental health issues. Not being married at 21 isn't necessarily a risk on its own, but combined with living alone, it might suggest limited support systems.\n\nShe has a GED and is enrolled in a 2-year college. A GED is equivalent to a high school diploma, so she has completed her basic education. Being enrolled in college is a positive factor as it suggests she's seeking further education, which can be protective against certain risks by providing better opportunities and social support.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. This could indicate instability in employment, which might relate to financial instability or other issues. However, it's also possible she's focusing on her education, so this isn't definitively negative.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is associated with more severe health and legal issues. Recent drug use can lead to addiction, health problems, and impaired judgment, increasing overall risk.\n\nShe has felt down most of the time in the past month. This indicates possible depression or other mental health issues. Persistent feelings of sadness can impair daily functioning, relationships, and overall well-being, increasing the risk of more severe mental health problems.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size five when young. A larger household might have led to less individual attention or resources, potentially contributing to stress or neglect, which can be risk factors for various negative outcomes.\n\nShe believes God has nothing to do with her personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be a protective factor for some people. Without such beliefs, she might not have the same coping mechanisms, which could increase risk in certain situations.\n\nPutting it all together, the presence of drug use, possible mental health issues, high BMI, employment instability, and limited social support all point towards high risk factors. However, her enrollment in college is a positive factor that might mitigate some risks. Considering the balance, I would predict a high risk with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests and conviction\", \"obesity\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"limited social support\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
