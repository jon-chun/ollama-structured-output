    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, although it depends on the nature of the offense.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and weighs 145 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk behavior unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest independence, but it could also mean less social support, which can sometimes be a risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a protective factor, as higher education can lead to better opportunities and stability. She's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing use, can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, though marijuana is generally considered less risky than other substances. She hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can increase risk factors.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in a rural area. A stable family environment is a protective factor, and rural areas might have different social dynamics but aren't inherently risky. She believes God has a role in her life, which can provide emotional support and reduce certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and conviction, job instability, and past drug use. However, she has several protective factors like education, stable upbringing, and current mental well-being. The presence of both risk and protective factors makes it a moderate risk, but not high. So, I would predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested and convicted\", \"job instability\", \"past drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
