    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male from an American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut background. I know that certain demographics might have higher risk profiles due to societal or systemic issues, but I'm not sure how significant this is on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as severe, but it still indicates some involvement with the law, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't contribute much to the risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might increase risk factors, but it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, so not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities, potentially increasing risks like unemployment or lower income, which can be stressors.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as it might lead to financial instability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other behaviors or as a coping mechanism for other issues.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are significant risk factors for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four when young. A stable family environment is a protective factor, so this might lower his risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the mental health issues and drug use are significant. The arrest and job instability add to the risk. However, the stable upbringing and education might mitigate some of that. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so I'll predict \"YES\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
