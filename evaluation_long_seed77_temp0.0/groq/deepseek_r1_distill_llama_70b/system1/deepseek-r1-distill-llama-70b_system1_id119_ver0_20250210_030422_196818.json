    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 190 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side, but not necessarily a risk factor unless it's related to health issues, which isn't mentioned here. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate independence, but it might also suggest limited social support, which could be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally a positive factor, so this might lower his risk. He's held one job during the year, which could indicate some instability, but it's not a major red flag.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more serious issues. However, he hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health can influence risk behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Believing that God has something to do with his life might provide emotional support and reduce risk factors related to behavior.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor is the drug use, particularly cocaine. However, other factors like education and family background are positive. The lack of conviction and current mental health status also mitigate the risk. So, while there's some risk, it's not high overall.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use (marijuana and cocaine)\", \"arrest without conviction\", \"living alone\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
