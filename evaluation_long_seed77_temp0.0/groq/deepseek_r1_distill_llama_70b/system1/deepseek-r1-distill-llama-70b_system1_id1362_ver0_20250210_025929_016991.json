    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not definitive.\n\nHe's been arrested four times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean he's had run-ins with the law, but no formal charges stuck. This might indicate some risky behavior but not necessarily a high risk of future issues.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that's probably not a factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lower educational attainment can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and potentially higher involvement in risky activities.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial stress or other underlying problems.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common, but chronic use could be a risk factor for other substance use or dependency, though it's not as severe as harder drugs.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or low mental health, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates and more exposure to risks, but family structure here seems stable with the biological mother.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk-taking behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: The lack of education, job instability, drug use, and mental health issues are concerning. However, the absence of convictions, religious beliefs, and stable upbringing might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a prediction of \"YES\" with around 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"young age\", \"multiple arrests\", \"low educational attainment\", \"unstable employment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 4 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
