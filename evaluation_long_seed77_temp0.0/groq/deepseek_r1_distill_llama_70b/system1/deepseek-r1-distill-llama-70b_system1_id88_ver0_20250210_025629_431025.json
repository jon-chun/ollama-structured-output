    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but age alone isn't a strong indicator. Next, he's been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which definitely points towards a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 155 lbs. His physical build doesn't seem particularly unusual or indicative of risk. Not being married and living alone at 19 isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own, but it might suggest some social isolation.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor as it might limit job opportunities and contribute to higher recidivism rates. He's only held one job in the past year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, another risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs like marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a known risk factor for criminal behavior and recidivism. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which might lower the risk compared to if he had active mental health issues.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally a stabilizing factor. He believes God has a role in his life, which might provide some positive influence, potentially lowering risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unstable employment, and drug use are strong indicators of high risk. While some factors like living with a biological parent and religious beliefs might mitigate risk a bit, the overall picture leans towards high risk. I'm about 85% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unstable employment\", \"Drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
