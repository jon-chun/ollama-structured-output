    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or other risks.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and weighs 145 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong indicators of risk in this context. Moving on, she's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but it's not a direct indicator. She's held three jobs in a year, which could indicate instability, but again, not a strong predictor on its own.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and used it most of the time in the past month. Drug use, especially frequent use, can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including legal issues or impaired judgment. Additionally, she's felt down most of the past month, which suggests possible depression or mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase risk factors, especially if left untreated.\n\nShe lived with her biological dad in an urban area as a child. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, which might influence behavior, but this is more of an environmental factor. She believes God has something to do with her life, which might provide some emotional support, potentially mitigating some risks.\n\nPutting it all together, the key factors are the criminal history, frequent drug use, and signs of depression. These are strong indicators that could point to a higher risk. However, without more context on the nature of the arrest or conviction, and the severity of her mental health state, the confidence isn't 100%. But considering these elements, I would lean towards a high risk prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
