    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might mean less life experience, which could be a factor.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can indicate potential for reoffending, especially if it's a recent conviction.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'3\" and 180 lbs. That's on the taller side but not necessarily a risk factor on its own unless it's related to physical behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate a lack of strong social support, which can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher risk for unemployment, poverty, and other social issues, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate financial instability, which is a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or combined with other issues.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which is a risk factor for other problems.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of five when young. A larger household might indicate economic stress or less individual attention, which can be a risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor, but in some contexts, it might indicate a sense of hopelessness or lack of support system.\n\nPutting it all together, the criminal history, lack of education, job instability, drug use, mental health issues, and living situation all point towards higher risk factors. However, the confidence level isn't 100% because some factors like age and drug use (marijuana) might not be as severe as other substances. So, I'd say high risk with about 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"low educational attainment\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"living situation\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
