    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still a flag.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 145 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but not sure how that ties to risk. Maybe health issues, but not directly a risk factor for, say, recidivism or other behaviors.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect stability, but not necessarily a high risk on its own. No high school diploma or GED and not in college. Education level is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, like unemployment or lower earning potential, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job instability could be a risk factor, indicating possible issues with employment, which might lead to financial instability. However, at 20, it's not too unusual to have job changes.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. These are positive factors, indicating lower risk for substance abuse or mental health issues that could contribute to other risks.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a rural area with a household of four. Stable family environment as a child, which is a protective factor. Believes God has a role in his life, which can provide emotional support and reduce certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education and job instability are concerning, but the absence of drug use, mental health issues, stable upbringing, and positive beliefs are mitigating factors. So, overall, the risk might not be high. I'm about 65% confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"no high school diploma\", \"held one job\", \"young age\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
