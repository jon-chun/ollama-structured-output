    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Next, she's been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor because a high number of arrests and a conviction can point to a pattern of behavior that might be risky or problematic.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. Her physical characteristics don't immediately stand out as risk factors unless related to health, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 18 is normal, and living situation might relate to support systems, but without more context, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socioeconomic challenges, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe's held only one job in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other underlying problems.\n\nShe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use, especially with a substance like cocaine, is a significant risk factor. It can lead to addiction, legal issues, and other health-related problems.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While that's positive, the absence of depression doesn't necessarily offset other risk factors.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area. A large household in an urban setting might have its own challenges, like limited resources or exposure to higher-risk environments.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. This could be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of community, which might mitigate some risks.\n\nPutting it all together: the multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, limited employment, and drug use are strong indicators of high risk. While her belief in God might help, the other factors are more concrete and significant. So, I would predict high risk with high confidence, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Lack of education\", \"Limited employment history\", \"Drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
