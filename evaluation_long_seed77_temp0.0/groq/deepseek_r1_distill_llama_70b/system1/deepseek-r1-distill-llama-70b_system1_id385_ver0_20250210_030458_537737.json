    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior, though one arrest isn't the highest indicator.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 198 lbs. His weight might put him in an overweight category, which could relate to health risks, but not necessarily behavioral risks. Being unmarried and living alone at 21 is pretty common, so that might not be a major risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college, which is a positive factor. Education often correlates with lower risk behaviors. He's held one job during the year, which could indicate some instability, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common and while it can have risks, it's not as severe as other substances. However, he's felt down several times in the past month, which could indicate mental health issues like depression. Mental health can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a rural area with a household size of three. A stable family environment is generally a protective factor. Believing that God influences his personal events might provide emotional support, which is positive.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and conviction, marijuana use, and recent feelings of depression. However, he's also in college and has a stable upbringing, which are protective. The risk isn't extremely high, but there are some concerning points. I'd say the prediction is YES, but with moderate confidence, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest and conviction\", \"marijuana use\", \"recent feelings of depression\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
