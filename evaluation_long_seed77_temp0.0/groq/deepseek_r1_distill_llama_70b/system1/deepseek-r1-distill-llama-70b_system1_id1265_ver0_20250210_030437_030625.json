    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested 8 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which suggests a history of criminal behavior. This is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHe weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. Weight doesn't seem relevant to risk assessment unless it's related to health, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence social support. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can correlate with higher risk, as it might limit job opportunities and stability.\n\nHe's held 3 jobs in a year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which is a risk factor for recidivism as it relates to financial instability.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor, though it's less severe than harder drugs. However, it's still a concern.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. That's a positive sign, as mental health issues can increase risk if not managed.\n\nHe lived with his biological father in an urban area as a child. Growing up in an urban environment might expose someone to higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent is generally a positive.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing a support system and moral framework.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions are the most concerning. While other factors like job instability and drug use contribute, the strong conviction history is a major red flag. However, the presence of religious beliefs and lack of recent depression might lower the risk slightly. So, I'd predict high risk with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"high arrest and conviction history\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
