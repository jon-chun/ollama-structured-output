    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 127 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically indicate risk unless there's something unusual, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 could mean independence, but it might also indicate a lack of support system, which could be a risk factor. However, she's enrolled in school, which is a positive sign as it suggests she's engaged in education and possibly building a future.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having a job shows responsibility, but only having one job might indicate instability or perhaps she's focusing on her studies. It's a bit of a neutral factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more serious issues. However, she hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive because mental health issues can compound other risks.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of five when she was young. A stable family background is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Additionally, her religious views don't seem to play a role in her personal life, which is neutral.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the arrest and drug use. However, the lack of conviction, stable family background, current enrollment in school, and absence of recent depression are mitigating factors. The drug use is concerning, but without more information on frequency or current usage, it's hard to gauge the severity. Overall, while there are some risk factors, they don't seem to indicate a high risk at this point.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest history\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
