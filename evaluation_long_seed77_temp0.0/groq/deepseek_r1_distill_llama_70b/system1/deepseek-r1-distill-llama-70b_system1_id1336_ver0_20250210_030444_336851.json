    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction could mean the charges were dropped or dismissed, which is better than a conviction. So this might not be a strong indicator.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 137 lbs. That's a bit underweight, but unless there's a health issue, physical characteristics alone don't usually indicate risk.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, which might lower risk factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is moderate, which is a neutral factor. Not necessarily a risk.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job stability can vary, but having two jobs might indicate responsibility or perhaps instability if he's moving around a lot. Not sure yet.\n\nNo drug use in four years. That's a positive sign, reduces risk of substance-related issues.\n\nHe's felt down some times in the past month. This could indicate mild depression or stress, but not severe enough to be a major risk unless it's persistent or severe.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with biological parents is a positive. Household size of six might mean limited resources, but again, not a direct risk.\n\nHe believes God influences his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: the main concerns are the arrest (though no conviction) and some feelings of depression. However, the lack of drug use, stable marriage, and education are positives. The risk seems moderate but not high. So I'd predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"some feelings of depression\", \"lived in urban area\", \"large household size\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
