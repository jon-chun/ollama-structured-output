    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors depending on other variables, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It could still be a red flag, but maybe not the highest risk.\n\nHis height and weight: 6'1\" and 140 lbs. That seems underweight for his height, which might indicate possible health issues, but I'm not sure how that ties into risk assessment unless it's related to substance use or other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might not be unusual, especially if he's just starting out. Not being married at 18 is pretty common, so that might not be a significant risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Having a GED is better than not having a diploma, but not attending college might limit his opportunities, which could be a risk factor for unemployment or lower income, but again, not directly a high risk indicator.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor, especially if it's a pattern, as it might lead to financial instability or other issues. This could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use is common, especially among young adults, and while it can have risks, it's generally considered lower risk compared to other substances. However, any drug use can be a risk factor depending on frequency and context.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Current mental health is good, which might lower the risk.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults at a young age in a household of size 3. This could indicate instability in his upbringing, which might be a risk factor for various negative outcomes. Unstable living situations can contribute to behavioral issues or other risks.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal life. This could be a protective factor, as religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks.\n\nPutting it all together: The unemployment and living situation might be moderate risk factors, but the lack of conviction, current mental health, and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The drug use is there but not the most severe. So overall, I don't see a high risk here. Maybe moderate at most, but not high. So the prediction would be NO, with a confidence level around 70% since there are some factors but not enough to indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once but not convicted\", \"unemployed in the past year\", \"lived with non-biological adults as a child\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
