    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It could indicate potential future issues, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'11\" and 158 lbs. That's within a normal range, so no risk there.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but it's not a strong indicator.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment and lower socioeconomic status, which might correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky activities.\n\nHe's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently. That's a positive sign, but mental health can change, so it's something to consider but not a direct risk here.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of 11 in a rural area. A large household might indicate economic stress or less individual attention, which could contribute to risk factors. Rural areas might have less access to resources and support.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be a protective factor for some, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education, unemployment, and drug use are significant risk factors. The arrest without conviction is a concern but not as severe. Living alone and coming from a large household add some context but aren't as impactful. The absence of depression is a positive point.\n\nI think the combination of unemployment, lack of education, and drug use are strong indicators for high risk. The arrest adds to it, but without a conviction, it's not as bad. So, I would predict high risk with moderate confidence, maybe around 70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"lack of education\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\", \"arrest history\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
