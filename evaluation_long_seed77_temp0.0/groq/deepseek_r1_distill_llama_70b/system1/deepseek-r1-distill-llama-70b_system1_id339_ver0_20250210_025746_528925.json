    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but it's not a definitive indicator on its own. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can point to potential recidivism or ongoing behavioral issues.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 141 lbs. His physical build doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor unless it's related to substance use or other health issues, which I don't have information on here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate some level of independence, but it could also suggest isolation or a lack of support system, which might contribute to risk factors.\n\nHe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can provide stability and reduce certain risks. However, he's held two jobs during the year. Job instability could indicate issues with maintaining employment, which might relate to other problems like substance use or personal issues.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug and can lead to more severe consequences. Additionally, he's felt down most of the time in the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health issues, which can increase risk if not addressed.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of six in a rural area. A large household might have led to less individual attention or resources, which could contribute to risk factors. Rural areas sometimes have less access to support services, which might exacerbate issues.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support, which might be a protective factor for some people. Without it, he might not have that network to rely on.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, drug use, mental health issues, job instability, and lack of support systems all point towards higher risk. However, being enrolled in school is a positive. I'm leaning towards high risk, but I'm not 100% certain because of the education factor. Maybe around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\", \"job instability\", \"lack of support system\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
