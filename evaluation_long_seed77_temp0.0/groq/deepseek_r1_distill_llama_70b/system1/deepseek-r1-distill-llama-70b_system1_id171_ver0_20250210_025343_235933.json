    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 140 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate some independence, but not necessarily a risk. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college, which is positive\u2014education usually correlates with lower risk.\n\nShe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate instability or issues with employment. She's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor depending on frequency and context, but it's not the most severe.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. Growing up with both biological parents in an urban area of size four. A stable family background is a protective factor, so that's good. She believes God has something to do with her life, which can provide emotional support and is generally a positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest without conviction, job instability, and past drug use are points to consider. However, her stable upbringing, education, lack of depression, and religious beliefs are protective. The risk factors present are moderate but not severe. So, I would predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"held 3 jobs in the past year\", \"past drug use (marijuana)\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
