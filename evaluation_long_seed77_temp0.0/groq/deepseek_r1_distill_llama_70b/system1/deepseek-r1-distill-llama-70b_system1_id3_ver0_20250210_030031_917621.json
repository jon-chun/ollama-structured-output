    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors depending on the context, but alone, they don't necessarily indicate high risk. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without more context, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions could mean a few things. Maybe he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, or perhaps the charges were dropped. This could indicate some level of risk, but since there are no convictions, it's not as severe.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'8\" and 180 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side for his height, but not excessively so. BMI-wise, he might be overweight, but that's more of a health factor than a risk factor for behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest independence, but it could also mean limited social support. Not being married at his age is pretty common, so that's not a big risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education is a positive factor. It shows he's taking steps towards his future, which is a good sign and might lower risk.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor. It might indicate issues with commitment, behavior, or maybe he's still figuring out his career path. This could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other behavioral problems. Cocaine, in particular, is a harder drug and can have more severe consequences.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but since he's not currently feeling depressed, it's a good indicator.\n\nHe grew up in a household of five. A larger household might mean more siblings or extended family. This could be neutral or even positive if it provided a supportive environment, but it could also be a stressor if resources were limited.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could relate to his coping mechanisms or support systems. If he doesn't find solace in religion, he might rely on other methods, which could be positive or negative depending on what they are.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the drug use and job instability. The lack of conviction and positive educational steps are mitigating factors. So, while there are some risks, they might not be high enough to warrant a \"YES\" prediction. The confidence is moderate because there are both positive and negative factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"drug use\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
