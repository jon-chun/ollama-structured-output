    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female of mixed race. Age and gender might influence risk, but race isn't typically a direct risk factor. Being young could mean she's still developing and might be more susceptible to certain risks, but it's not definitive.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could indicate a lower risk since it didn't lead to a guilty verdict. However, the fact that she was arrested at all might suggest some level of involvement in risky behavior.\n\nHer physical characteristics\u20145'5\" and 120 lbs\u2014don't seem relevant to risk assessment unless we're considering health-related risks, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate independence, but it could also mean limited support systems, which might increase certain risks like mental health issues if she's isolated.\n\nShe's currently enrolled in school, which is a positive factor. Education can provide stability and reduce certain risks associated with unemployment or lack of structure.\n\nShe's held two jobs in the past year. This could indicate responsibility, but frequent job changes might also suggest instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years and some use in the past month. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor for other substance use or dependency. However, marijuana is generally considered lower risk compared to other drugs.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which are significant risk factors for various negative outcomes, including substance abuse or self-harm.\n\nShe grew up in a household of six. A large family might have provided support, but it could also mean less individual attention or resources, potentially leading to behavioral issues.\n\nShe believes God influences her personal events. This could provide emotional support and reduce certain risks, as religious beliefs can offer coping mechanisms and a sense of community.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest, drug use, and mental health concerns are notable. However, she's in school and has a job, which are protective factors. The lack of conviction and her religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The mental health aspect is concerning but not severe enough on its own without more information.\n\nI think the overall risk isn't high. The factors don't strongly indicate a high risk profile, so the prediction would be \"NO\" with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction)\", \"marijuana use\", \"felt down in the past month\", \"living alone\", \"held 2 jobs in the past year\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

She is enrolled in school at the present moment. She has held 2 jobs during the year.
