    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male, Asian/Pacific Islander. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, he's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and 180 lbs. His physical size could be a factor in certain contexts, but without more info, it's hard to say. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate some isolation, which can sometimes be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Not pursuing higher education could limit his opportunities, potentially leading to higher risk situations due to unemployment or underemployment. He hasn't held any jobs in the past year, which is a red flag. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. Recent drug use is a bigger risk factor than past use, so this is a good sign. However, he's felt down a lot in the past month. Feeling down could indicate depression or other mental health issues, which can be a risk factor if left unaddressed.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a large household in an urban area. A stable family background is generally a protective factor, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or exposure to risky situations. He doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be associated with different coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are his unemployment, recent feelings of depression, and the arrest. However, the absence of drug use and a stable upbringing are positives. The risk seems moderate, but not extremely high. So, I'd predict a moderate risk, maybe a 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"unemployment\", \"recent depression\", \"arrest without conviction\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
