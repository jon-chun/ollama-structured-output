    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and 180 lbs. His physical size could be a factor in certain contexts, but alone, it doesn't necessarily indicate risk. He's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might suggest some isolation, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities, but having a diploma is a positive. He's held one job in the past year, which could indicate some instability, but it's not a major red flag.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive and reduces risk factors related to substance abuse or mental health. His upbringing was with both biological parents in an urban area, which is a stable family background. Believing in God might provide emotional support, which is a protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors don't point to high risk. The arrests are a concern but without convictions, and other factors like stable upbringing and no substance abuse lower the risk. So, I'd predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 20\",\n    \"Gender: Male\",\n    \"Race: White\",\n    \"Arrests: 2 (no convictions)\",\n    \"Height: 6'1\\\"\",\n    \"Weight: 180 lbs\",\n    \"Marital Status: Never married\",\n    \"Living Situation: Lives alone\",\n    \"Education: High school diploma, not in college\",\n    \"Employment: Held 1 job in the past year\",\n    \"Drug Use: None in the past 4 years\",\n    \"Mental Health: No depression in the past month\",\n    \"Family Background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area\",\n    \"Religious Beliefs: Believes God influences personal events\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
