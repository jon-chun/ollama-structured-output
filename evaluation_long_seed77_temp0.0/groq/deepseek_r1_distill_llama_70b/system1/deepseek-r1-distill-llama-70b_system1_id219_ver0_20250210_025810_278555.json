    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Being young might mean he's still developing, but without more context, it's neutral.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which could point to a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 165 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk factors unless in extreme cases, which this isn't. So, this is probably not a significant factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Living alone might indicate less social support, which could be a risk factor, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a protective factor. Being enrolled in college suggests he's trying to improve his situation, which might lower his risk.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor. Frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment, which could relate to other problems like substance abuse or behavioral issues.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, legal issues, and other risky behaviors. Recent use, especially with harder drugs like cocaine, increases the risk.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase risk, especially if left untreated.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban household of five. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Growing up in an urban area might have its challenges, but having both parents around is positive.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by offering a sense of community and purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: The multiple arrests, convictions, drug use, and mental health issues are strong indicators of high risk. However, his educational enrollment and stable upbringing might mitigate some of that risk. The job instability is a bit concerning but not as severe as the other factors.\n\nI think the risk is present, but considering the mitigating factors, the confidence isn't extremely high. Maybe around 70% confidence that these factors indicate high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and convictions\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held 3 jobs during the year.
