    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and has been convicted. That's a significant number of arrests and a conviction, which could indicate a pattern of behavior that might be risky. Recidivism is a concern here.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 11 inches and he weighs 165 lbs. That's quite tall and underweight. Maybe health issues, but not sure how that ties to risk behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might not be unusual, but not having a stable family structure could be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit opportunities, which could increase risk factors like unemployment.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including recidivism or further legal issues.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can sometimes be a risk factor, though it's less severe than harder drugs. However, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, which might influence behavior. Living with his mother could be a stabilizing factor, but the urban setting might pose risks.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing support and reducing risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together, the high number of arrests and convictions are red flags. Unemployment and lack of education beyond high school could contribute to ongoing issues. However, the absence of depression and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but the confidence isn't 100% because there are some positive factors too.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and convictions\", \"Unemployment\", \"Limited education\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
