    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but I'm not sure how race plays into this beyond potential systemic issues.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, especially if it's a recent conviction.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 150-174 lbs. That's average, so probably not a risk factor unless in specific contexts, but I don't see how that's relevant here.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can affect support systems. Not living alone might mean he has family around, which could be a protective factor, but not having a stable partner might indicate less social support.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lower educational attainment is linked to higher risk of unemployment and recidivism. Education often provides skills and opportunities that reduce criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of criminal behavior. Without a steady income, individuals might resort to illegal activities out of necessity or due to idle time.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially recent, can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. However, marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, so the impact might be moderate.\n\nHe's felt down most of the past month. This indicates possible depression. Mental health issues can increase the risk of criminal behavior, especially if untreated. Depression can lead to impulsivity or hopelessness that might contribute to criminal acts.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. A larger household might mean less individual attention, but living with a biological parent is generally a positive. Rural areas might have different challenges, like less access to resources or higher unemployment rates.\n\nHe doesn't believe God influences his life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a risk factor, as religion can provide a support system and moral framework. However, this can vary widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: criminal history, unemployment, lack of education, recent drug use, and mental health issues are strong indicators. His living situation and background are mixed. The combination of these factors, especially the criminal history and unemployment, points towards a higher risk. However, the presence of family (living with mom) might mitigate some risk. Confidence is high but not certain because some factors are protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"unemployment\", \"lack of education\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
