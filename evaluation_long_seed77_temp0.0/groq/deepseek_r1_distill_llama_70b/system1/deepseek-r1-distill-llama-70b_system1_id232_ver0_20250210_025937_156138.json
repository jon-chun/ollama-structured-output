    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it could still indicate some level of risk.\n\nShe's 5 feet 3 inches and weighs 185 lbs. Her BMI would be around 34.5, which is considered obese. Obesity can lead to various health issues, which might be a risk factor for certain outcomes, but I'm not sure how it ties into behavioral or recidivism risk.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marriage can be a stabilizing factor, which might lower risk. Having a stable living situation can provide support and reduce certain risks associated with instability.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and other socioeconomic challenges, which might increase risk in some contexts.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor for various negative outcomes, including financial instability, which might contribute to higher risk.\n\nShe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a common factor, but it's not as severe as harder drugs. However, any drug use can still be a risk factor depending on the context.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. This is a positive indicator; lack of recent depression might lower risk factors related to mental health issues.\n\nShe grew up with her biological parent in an urban area with a household size of four. Living with biological parents can be a stabilizing factor, but urban areas might have higher crime rates or other environmental risks.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce certain risks by providing a sense of community and purpose.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors that might indicate higher risk are the arrest, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. However, she has stabilizing factors like marriage, living with spouse, no recent depression, and religious beliefs. The absence of a conviction and the fact that she's married might mitigate some risks. Obesity is a health risk but not directly related to behavioral risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a lower risk assessment because the positive factors might outweigh the negative ones. Her lack of education and unemployment are concerning, but without more severe indicators like convictions or harder drug use, the overall risk might not be high. So, I would predict \"NO\" with a moderate confidence level, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once (no conviction\", \"no high school diploma or GED\", \"unemployed\", \"past drug use (marijuana)\", \"obesity\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
