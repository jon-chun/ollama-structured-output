    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can be factors, but alone they don't indicate much. Next, she's been arrested three times but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might suggest she's had run-ins with the law, but without convictions, it's unclear if she's a high risk.\n\nShe's 5'1\" and weighs 155 lbs. That's a bit on the heavier side for her height, but not significantly so. Physical characteristics alone don't usually indicate risk unless there's something else.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 18 is normal, and living situation might relate to stability, but not necessarily a risk factor.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is a factor, but having a diploma is a positive. Not being in college could relate to job stability or future prospects.\n\nShe's held seven jobs in a year. That's a high turnover, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor, especially cocaine, which is a harder drug. Recent use in the past month could indicate ongoing issues.\n\nShe's felt down several times in the past month. This could point to mental health issues like depression, which is another risk factor.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in a household of five in a rural area. A rural upbringing might have different challenges, but not necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. This could relate to her support system or coping mechanisms, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, high job turnover, drug use, and mental health issues are significant. However, the lack of convictions and having a diploma are positives. The mental health and drug use are concerning, but without more severe indicators, I'm leaning towards moderate risk. So, prediction is YES, but confidence is around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests\", \"high job turnover\", \"drug use\", \"mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
