    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. It might not have been a serious offense, or maybe the charges were dropped. However, having an arrest on record could still indicate some level of risk, especially if it's related to behavior that could recur.\n\nHe's 5'5\" and weighs 146 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk factors unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Not living alone might mean he has a support system, which could be a protective factor. On the other hand, not being married at 20 is pretty common, so it's not a strong indicator.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect opportunities and stability. Not being enrolled in college might limit his future prospects, which could contribute to risk factors if he's struggling to find stable employment.\n\nHe's held three jobs in a year. Job instability can be a risk factor. Frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment, which could relate to financial instability or other underlying problems.\n\nHe's used cocaine in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor. Cocaine use can lead to addiction, legal issues, and other behavioral problems. Recent drug use, even if not frequent, is a concern.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate depression or other mental health issues. Mental health struggles can increase risk, especially if left untreated. They can affect behavior, relationships, and overall stability.\n\nHe grew up in a household of six. A large family might mean less individual attention or resources, which could contribute to various risks, but it's not a direct indicator on its own.\n\nHe believes God influences his personal events. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, providing support and a sense of purpose. However, if taken to an extreme, it might not contribute to risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the significant risk factors here are the arrest, cocaine use, recent feelings of depression, and job instability. These factors can contribute to behavioral issues, legal problems, and mental health concerns. However, the absence of a conviction, having a high school diploma, and religious beliefs might mitigate some of the risk. The confidence level is moderate because while there are concerning factors, there are also elements that suggest stability or support.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrest history\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\", \"job instability\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
