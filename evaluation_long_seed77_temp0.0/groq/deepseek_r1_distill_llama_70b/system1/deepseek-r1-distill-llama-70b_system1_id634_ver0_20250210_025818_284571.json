    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being Hispanic alone isn't necessarily a risk factor. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because a criminal history can indicate a higher risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 180 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong indicators of risk. Being married and living with his spouse could be a stabilizing factor, which might lower risk. Having a GED suggests he has a basic education, which is better than not having it, but not as good as a high school diploma or college enrollment.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but frequent job changes might indicate instability, though two jobs in a year isn't too bad. He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially ongoing, can be a risk factor for various behaviors, but marijuana is less severe than harder drugs.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month, which is positive. However, his living situation as a child with non-biological parents in a small household might indicate some instability or lack of support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. This could relate to his support system or outlook on life, but it's not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the criminal history and past drug use. However, he has stabilizing factors like marriage, employment, and no recent depression. So, while there are some risks, they might not be high enough to classify as a high risk overall. I'm leaning towards a \"NO\" prediction with moderate confidence, maybe around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"past drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
