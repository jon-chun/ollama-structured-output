    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Young males are often associated with higher risk behaviors, so that's a point to consider. He's been arrested four times and has a conviction. Multiple arrests and a conviction definitely point towards a higher risk, as it indicates a history of engaging in illegal activities.\n\nHe's 6 feet 2 inches and weighs between 175 and 199 lbs. While height and weight can be factors in certain contexts, like physical altercations, they alone don't necessarily indicate high risk without other factors. So I'll note this but not weigh it too heavily.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at a young age isn't unusual, but living situation can sometimes relate to stability. Not living alone might mean he has family support, which could be a protective factor, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and potentially higher involvement in criminal activities. This is a significant point towards higher risk.\n\nHe's held five jobs in a year. Job instability can indicate issues with employment, which might relate to behavioral problems or inability to maintain steady work, both of which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential issues, including higher risk of reoffending or engaging in risky behaviors. Recent drug use, especially cocaine, is more concerning than marijuana.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can increase risk if left untreated. Mental health struggles can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of size four. Household size alone isn't a strong indicator, but it might relate to family dynamics. Without more info, I won't give this much weight.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose or community, which might lower risk. However, this can vary widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, job instability, drug use, and mental health issues all point towards high risk. The religious belief might slightly lower the risk, but the other factors are more significant. So, I'd predict high risk with high confidence, maybe around 85%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Lack of education\", \"Job instability\", \"Drug use\", \"Mental health issues\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
