    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but I'm not sure how significant they are on their own. Being young might mean less life experience, but it's not a direct indicator of high risk.\n\nHe's been arrested four times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which could point to a higher risk of reoffending or other negative outcomes.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 155 lbs. I don't think physical characteristics like height and weight are strong indicators of risk. They don't really correlate with behavior or risk levels.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status and living situation can influence stability. Living alone at a young age might indicate a lack of support system, which could be a risk factor, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for various negative outcomes, including unemployment and higher likelihood of criminal activity. This is a significant point.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial instability, which might increase the risk of engaging in illegal activities or other risky behaviors. This is another important factor.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially over an extended period, can be a risk factor. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, so the impact might be lower, but it's still a consideration.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health can play a role in risk, but not feeling depressed doesn't necessarily indicate low risk. It could mean he's coping well, but without more info, it's hard to assess.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a large household in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates or environmental risks, which could contribute to higher risk factors.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose or community, which might lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use are all significant risk factors. While some factors like religious belief might mitigate risk, the combination of the others leans towards a higher risk assessment. I'm about 85% confident in this prediction.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"multiple arrests and conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
