    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black female. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal record can indicate a higher risk, especially if it's a recent conviction. However, I don't know the nature of the offense, which could affect the risk level.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'10\" and 127 lbs. That seems average, so probably not a risk factor unless it's related to health, but there's no indication of that here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest independence, but it could also mean less support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a positive factor, indicating stability and lower risk. Being enrolled suggests she's focused on her future.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Having a job shows responsibility, which is a positive sign. It might indicate stability and lower risk.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, but marijuana is less severe than other drugs. It depends on frequency and impact on her life, which isn't detailed here.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Good mental health is a positive sign, reducing risk factors related to mental health issues.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, lowering risk. Urban areas can have higher risks, but with a stable home, the impact might be mitigated.\n\nShe believes God has a role in her life. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce risk factors by promoting positive behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction is a red flag, but other factors like education, employment, stable upbringing, and mental health are positive. The drug use is there but not severe. So, the overall risk might not be high. I'm leaning towards a low risk prediction with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"conviction\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
