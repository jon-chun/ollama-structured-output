    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but race alone isn't a risk factor.\n\nHe's been arrested five times and has a conviction. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in criminal behavior, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism.\n\nHis height and weight (5'11\", 260 lbs) don't directly indicate risk unless related to health issues, but that's not specified here. So I'll set that aside.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Marital status and living situation can relate to stability. Not living alone might mean less stable living conditions or less accountability, which could be a risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for unemployment and higher likelihood of criminal involvement. It can limit opportunities and increase the chances of recidivism.\n\nHe's held only one job in the past year. Unstable employment history is another risk factor. It suggests difficulty maintaining employment, which can lead to financial instability and increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if not current, can be a risk factor, especially if it's associated with other behaviors. However, marijuana is less severe than other drugs, so the impact might be lower.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed in the past month. Current mental health isn't indicating a problem, but past mental health issues could still be a factor if present.\n\nHe lived with non-biological adults at a young age in an urban area. Unstable family environment and growing up in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates and influences, increasing risk factors.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with lower social support, which might be a risk factor, but it's not as strong as others.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unstable employment, and unstable living situation are strong indicators. Drug use is present but less severe. The living situation as a child and current social factors add to the risk. So, overall, these factors do indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"Multiple arrests and conviction\", \"Lack of education\", \"Unstable employment\", \"Unstable living situation\", \"Drug use\", \"Unstable childhood environment\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
