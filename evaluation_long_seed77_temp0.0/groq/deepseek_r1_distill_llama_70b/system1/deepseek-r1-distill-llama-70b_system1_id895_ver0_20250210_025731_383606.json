    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one and see how they contribute to the overall risk.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors depending on other variables, but alone they don't necessarily indicate high risk. However, being young might mean less life experience and possibly more impulsive behavior.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and has been convicted. That's a significant factor. Multiple arrests and a conviction suggest a history of engaging in illegal activities, which is a strong indicator of potential recidivism or continued risky behavior.\n\nHe's 6 feet 6 inches tall. Height alone isn't typically a risk factor, but it might contribute to how he's perceived by others, possibly leading to more scrutiny or interactions with law enforcement.\n\nHe's never been married and is currently living alone. Marital status and living situation can influence social support. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and higher rates of criminal activity. Without education, job opportunities are limited, which can lead to more desperation or involvement in illegal activities.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is another significant risk factor. Without a steady income, individuals might resort to illegal means to make money, increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and some of the time in the past month felt down. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can impair judgment and decision-making. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues like depression, which if untreated, can lead to more severe problems, including substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nHe grew up in a household of seven. A large household might indicate a stressful or unstable environment during formative years, which can contribute to behavioral issues later in life.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support or a different coping mechanism, which might influence his behavior and decision-making, though this is less directly tied to risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the multiple arrests, conviction, lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and possible mental health issues all point towards a higher risk. The other factors like living alone and household size add to the context but aren't as directly impactful. The confidence level is high because several strong indicators are present, but it's not 100% because there might be mitigating factors not mentioned, like support systems or rehabilitation efforts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Multiple arrests and conviction\",\n    \"Lack of education\",\n    \"Unemployment\",\n    \"Drug use\",\n    \"Possible mental health issues\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
