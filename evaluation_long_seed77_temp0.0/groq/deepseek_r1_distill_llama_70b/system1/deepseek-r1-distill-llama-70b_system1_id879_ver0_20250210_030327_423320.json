    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old Black female. Age and race might not be direct risk factors, but being young could relate to inexperience or impulsivity. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal record can impact future opportunities and behavior.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. I don't see how her physical characteristics directly relate to risk unless it's about health, but that's not indicated here. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest independence, but without more context, it's hard to say if that's a risk.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. She's held three jobs in a year, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be a risk factor.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign. Her living situation as a child\u2014living with her biological mother in a household of four\u2014doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor unless there were issues like abuse or neglect, which aren't mentioned.\n\nShe believes God influences her life, which can be a protective factor, providing emotional support and a sense of purpose.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction, lack of education, job instability, and drug use are risk factors. However, her mental health seems stable, and her beliefs might help mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so a confidence level around 60% seems appropriate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"conviction\", \"lack of education\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
