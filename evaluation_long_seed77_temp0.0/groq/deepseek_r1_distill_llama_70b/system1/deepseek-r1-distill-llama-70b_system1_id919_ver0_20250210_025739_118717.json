    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Being Black might relate to systemic issues, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to personal risk here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it still shows some involvement with the law, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 165 lbs. That seems a bit underweight for his height, but I'm not sure how that relates to risk assessment. Maybe it's a red herring.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 19 might indicate independence, but it could also suggest limited social support, which could be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor for unemployment, lower income, and potentially higher involvement in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability, a known risk factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if it's just marijuana, can be a risk factor, especially if it's frequent or interferes with daily life. However, since it's only mentioned as past use, the current risk might be lower.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Current mental health is good, which might lower the risk.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a rural area at a young age. Rural areas might have different access to resources, but living with a biological parent is generally a stable environment.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could relate to his support system or coping mechanisms, but I'm not sure how significant this is in risk assessment.\n\nPutting it all together: the lack of education, job instability, and past drug use are notable risk factors. However, he hasn't been convicted, isn't currently depressed, and has a stable living situation as a child. The arrest without conviction and current living situation might not be as high risk as other factors. \n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, but not extremely high. So, the prediction would be \"YES\" for some level of risk, but the confidence isn't very high, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"no high school diploma\", \"job instability\", \"past drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
