    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction might not be as significant as a conviction, but it's still something to note.\n\nShe's 5'3\" and weighs between 150-174 lbs. That's within a normal weight range, so I don't see that as a risk factor. She's never been married and isn't living alone. Not being married at 22 is pretty common, and living situation might relate to support systems, but not sure if it's a risk factor.\n\nShe has a GED and isn't in college. A GED is equivalent to a high school diploma, so that's fine. Not being in college could relate to employment stability, but she's held four jobs in a year. That might indicate instability or difficulty keeping a job, which could be a risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. However, she's felt down some times in the past month. Feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which can be a risk factor if severe.\n\nShe grew up with her biological mother in an urban area. Urban environments can have different challenges, but without more info, it's hard to assess. She believes God influences her life, which might provide emotional support, potentially lowering risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the job instability and recent feelings of sadness stand out. However, she has a stable living situation, no drug use, and a support system. The arrest without conviction is a minor concern. Overall, while there are some flags, they don't strongly indicate a high risk. So, I'd predict low risk with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"age\", \"arrested once\", \"held 4 jobs in a year\", \"felt down in the past month\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
