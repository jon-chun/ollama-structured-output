    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't necessarily mean high risk on its own. Next, she's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, although it depends on the nature of the offense.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 145 lbs. Physical characteristics like height and weight don't typically correlate with risk behavior unless in extreme cases, which this doesn't seem to be. She's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might indicate independence, but it could also suggest isolation, which sometimes is a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is usually a protective factor, as higher education can lead to better opportunities and stability. However, she's held five jobs in a year. Job instability could be a risk factor, as frequent job changes might indicate issues with employment or personal stability.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive sign. Recent drug use is a stronger indicator of risk, so her abstinence is good. However, she's felt down some of the time in the past month. This could indicate mild depression or stress, which might be a risk factor if it's severe, but it's not clear if it's at a level that impairs functioning.\n\nShe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background is a protective factor, but urban environments can sometimes have higher crime rates or exposure to risks. She believes God has a role in her life, which can provide emotional support and be a protective factor against risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest and conviction are concerning, but she has several protective factors like education, stable upbringing, and no recent drug use. The job instability and occasional feelings of sadness are notable but not severe enough on their own. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't strongly indicate a high risk overall. I'll predict \"NO\" with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested and convicted\", \"job instability\", \"occasional feelings of sadness\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
