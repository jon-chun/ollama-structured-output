    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk for certain behaviors, but age alone isn't the only factor. He's White, but I don't think race is a significant risk factor here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. That's a red flag because a history of arrests and convictions can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending or engaging in risky behavior.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't contribute much to the risk assessment.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at a young age might suggest some instability or lack of strong social support, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education can be a protective factor, but not pursuing higher education might limit his opportunities, potentially increasing risk if he can't find stable employment.\n\nHe's held seven jobs in a year. Job instability is a concern because it can indicate issues with commitment, behavior, or reliability, all of which can contribute to higher risk.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, including marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it can lead to dependency, impaired judgment, and involvement in criminal activities.\n\nHe's felt down several times in the past month. This could indicate mental health issues like depression, which can increase risk if left untreated.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family background might be a protective factor, but urban environments can sometimes expose individuals to higher risks depending on the neighborhood.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his life. Lack of religious affiliation might not be a direct risk factor, but it could indicate a sense of disconnection from community support systems.\n\nPutting it all together, the history of arrests, convictions, job instability, drug use, and possible mental health issues all point towards a higher risk. However, he does have a stable family background, which might mitigate some risks. I'm leaning towards a high risk prediction, but I'm not 100% confident because some factors are protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"history of arrests and convictions\", \"job instability\", \"drug use\", \"mental health concerns\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 7 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
