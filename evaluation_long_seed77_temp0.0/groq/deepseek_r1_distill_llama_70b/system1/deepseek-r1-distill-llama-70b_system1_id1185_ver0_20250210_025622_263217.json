    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has a conviction. Arrests and convictions can indicate a history of problematic behavior, which might suggest higher risk. However, it's important to know the nature of the arrests and convictions, which isn't provided here.\n\nHe's 5'7\", which is average height, so that's probably not a significant factor.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean less social support, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but it's not definitive.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Lower educational attainment can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, but again, it's not a direct indicator.\n\nHe's held four jobs in a year. Job instability could suggest issues with maintaining employment, which might relate to higher risk behaviors, but it could also be due to other factors like job market conditions.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is a positive sign. Substance use is a known risk factor, and not using drugs is a good indicator of lower risk.\n\nHe grew up in a large household in an urban area. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes be a factor, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the arrests and convictions are the main red flags, but the absence of drug use and depression, along with stable living conditions, might mitigate those risks. I'm leaning towards a lower risk assessment, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe around 40% confidence that it's not a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrests and convictions\", \"job instability\", \"living alone\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
