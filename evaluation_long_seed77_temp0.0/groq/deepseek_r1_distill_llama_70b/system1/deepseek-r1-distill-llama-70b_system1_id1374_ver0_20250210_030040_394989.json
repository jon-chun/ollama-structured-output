    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male. Young males are often considered higher risk in certain contexts, like criminal behavior, because they might be more impulsive. But I'm not sure how significant age is here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction could mean a few things. Maybe he was in the wrong place at the wrong time, or perhaps the charges were dropped. It's a flag, but not a definite indicator of high risk.\n\nHis height and weight are average, so that probably doesn't contribute much to risk assessment. Physical build isn't a strong indicator unless it's extreme.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might suggest some independence, but it could also indicate social isolation, which can be a risk factor for certain behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can affect future opportunities, but not being in college doesn't necessarily mean high risk. It's more about his choices and opportunities.\n\nHe's held one job in the past year. Job stability can be a factor. Having only one job might indicate instability or maybe he's just starting out, so it's a bit of a neutral point.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can lead to dependency, impaired judgment, and engagement in risky behaviors. This is a red flag.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's positive, but mental health can change, and past drug use might still be a concern.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in a rural area as a child. A stable family environment is a protective factor, which reduces risk. Rural areas might have different challenges, but overall, this is a positive point.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. Lack of religious affiliation can sometimes correlate with different risk behaviors, but it's not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, the main concerns are the drug use and the arrest. However, without a conviction, the arrest is less severe. The stable upbringing and lack of current depression are positives. So, while there are some risk factors, they might not be high enough to classify as high risk overall. I'm leaning towards a moderate risk, so the prediction would be \"NO\" with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once\", \"drug use\", \"living alone\", \"not in college\", \"young male\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
