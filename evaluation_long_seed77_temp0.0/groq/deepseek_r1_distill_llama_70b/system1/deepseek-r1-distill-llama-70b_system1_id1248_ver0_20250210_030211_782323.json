    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Black male. Age and race aren't direct risk factors, but they can be contextual. Being young might relate to higher impulsivity, but that's not certain.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction might suggest some involvement with the law, but without a conviction, it's not as severe. It could indicate potential issues, but not definitively.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. That's a normal build, not particularly indicating risk unless in specific contexts, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and not living alone. Living situation can affect stability, but not necessarily a direct risk factor. It might relate to social support, but not a strong indicator.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not in college. This is a significant factor. Lower educational attainment is often linked to higher risk of unemployment, lower income, and potentially higher involvement in risky behaviors.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Job instability could indicate issues with employment, which might relate to financial instability or other stressors.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is common but can be a risk factor depending on frequency and context. However, it's not as severe as harder drugs.\n\nNot feeling depressed in the past month. This is a positive factor, suggesting current mental health is stable.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a large household in a rural area as a child. Large family size and rural setting might have different implications, but without more context, it's hard to assess. Rural areas might have different access to resources.\n\nDoesn't believe God has anything to do with his personal life. This could relate to coping mechanisms or support systems, but not a direct risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factors are the lack of education and job instability. These can contribute to higher risk in areas like socioeconomic stability and potential legal issues. However, the absence of depression and no convictions are positive points. The drug use is moderate. So, while there are some risk factors, they don't strongly indicate a high risk overall. Therefore, the prediction is NO with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    \"Age: 21\",\n    \"Gender: Male\",\n    \"Race: Black\",\n    \"Arrested once, no conviction\",\n    \"Height: 6'1\\\", Weight: 180 lbs\",\n    \"Never married, not living alone\",\n    \"No high school diploma or GED, not in college\",\n    \"Held 2 jobs in the past year\",\n    \"Marijuana use in past four years\",\n    \"No depression in past month\",\n    \"Lived with biological mother in a household of size 6 in a rural area as a child\",\n    \"Believes God has nothing to do with personal events\"\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
