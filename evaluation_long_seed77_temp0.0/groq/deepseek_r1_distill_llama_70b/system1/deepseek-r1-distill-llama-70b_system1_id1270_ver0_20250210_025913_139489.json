    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being young doesn't automatically mean high risk. Hispanic background might relate to socioeconomic factors, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor. A criminal history, especially a conviction, can indicate a higher likelihood of reoffending, depending on the nature of the offense. However, one arrest and conviction alone might not be definitive, but it's a point to consider.\n\nHis height and weight are 6'1\" and 240 lbs. While this might make him appear intimidating, physical size alone isn't a direct risk factor unless it's related to aggression or specific behaviors.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could indicate social isolation, which might be a risk factor for certain behaviors, but it's not a strong indicator on its own. Not being married at 21 is pretty common, so that might not be a big issue.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can be a risk factor because it might limit job opportunities, leading to financial instability, which can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment can definitely be a risk factor. It can lead to financial stress, which might contribute to criminal activity or other negative behaviors.\n\nHe's used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. It can impair judgment, lead to addiction, and increase the likelihood of engaging in risky or illegal activities.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. That's a positive sign. Mental health issues can be a risk factor, but the absence of recent depression might lower the risk compared to someone who is depressed.\n\nHe grew up with his biological mother in an urban area with a household size of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but living with a biological parent might provide some stability. Household size isn't directly a risk factor unless it contributed to neglect or overcrowding.\n\nHe believes God has a role in his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes be a protective factor, providing a sense of purpose or community, which might lower risk.\n\nPutting it all together: the conviction, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use are strong indicators. However, the absence of depression and having a religious belief might mitigate some risk. The other factors like age, living alone, and background are less significant. So, I think the overall risk is high, but maybe not the highest possible. Confidence might be around 80%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"criminal history\", \"lack of education\", \"unemployment\", \"drug use\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
