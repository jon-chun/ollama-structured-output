    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age and gender can sometimes be risk factors, but being White doesn't inherently indicate risk. Next, he's been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant factor because a criminal history can be a predictor of future behavior, though it's just one incident.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall and weighs 190 lbs. Physical characteristics alone don't usually indicate risk unless in specific contexts, which aren't mentioned here. He's married and living with his spouse, which is a positive factor as it suggests stability and support.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education is generally a protective factor against risk, as it often correlates with better opportunities and stability. He's held two jobs in the past year, which shows some employment history, though job stability might be a factor if he's changing jobs frequently.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a risk factor, but marijuana is less severe than harder drugs. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive as mental health issues can increase risk.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. A stable family environment is a protective factor. Believing that God has a role in his life might provide emotional support and reduce risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the main risk factor is the arrest and conviction. However, other factors like education, employment, stable living situation, and mental well-being suggest lower risk. So, the overall risk is probably low, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe around 20% confidence that it's a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\"arrested once and convicted\", \"used marijuana in the past four years\"],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 20\n}\n```",
