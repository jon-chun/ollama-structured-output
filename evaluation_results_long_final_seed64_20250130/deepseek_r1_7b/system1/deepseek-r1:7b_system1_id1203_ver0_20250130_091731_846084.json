    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male of Black descent. While race can be a factor in recidivism rates, it's not directly indicative without more context. So maybe that's a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and convicted. That's a significant number of prior convictions, which is definitely a high-risk indicator. Each prior offense increases the likelihood of future criminal behavior.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 1 inch and he weighs 165 lbs. While weight can be an indicator in some contexts, without knowing his body fat percentage or other health metrics, it's hard to assess if this is a risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's never been married and currently living alone. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior unless there are underlying issues like substance abuse or mental health problems, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; not having a degree can increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors due to lack of opportunities or support.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Employment stability is linked to lower recidivism rates, so holding a job might actually be protective rather than a risk factor.\n\nHe used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years and felt down for some months. Drug use can lead to impulsive behaviors or increased risk of substance abuse, which are known risk factors.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. Living in a multi-parent household doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless there were issues like neglect or abuse, which aren't specified here.\n\nHe believes in God and thinks it affects his personal outcomes. Religious beliefs can influence behavior, but without specific evidence of problematic behavior influenced by religion, this might not be a strong indicator.\n\nPutting all these together: four prior convictions are a strong red flag. His drug use and lack of education also contribute to high risk. While other factors like living situation and race aren't definitive on their own, the combination makes him a high-risk individual.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
