    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old White female with one arrest but no conviction. That might not be too concerning on its own since it's just an arrest without a conviction. However, her age is quite young, which could mean she's still developing her life skills and hasn't faced significant consequences yet.\n\nShe's 5'7\" and weighs 155 lbs. Her height and weight don't immediately raise red flags unless there's something about her body type that suggests health issues or substance use, but I don't see any direct link here.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Living alone can be a sign of social isolation, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors like drug use or self-harm. But again, it depends on other factors.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree and isn't in college now. Education level is usually a positive factor, but not being enrolled could mean she's focusing on other areas, maybe substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nShe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences can indicate adaptability, which might reduce risk. However, if she's been unemployed for long periods or facing challenges at work, that could be a concern.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. She admitted to using drugs recently as well. Drug use is a strong indicator of potential risky behavior, especially if it's recent or if she's struggling with addiction.\n\nShe felt down for most of the past month, which might suggest depression or low mood. This could be a sign of emotional distress that isn't being managed properly, possibly leading to self-harm behaviors.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of four with both parents, which is quite a stressful environment. Being raised in a large family can lead to complex emotions and behavioral issues if not properly addressed.\n\nShe believes God has nothing to do with her life. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support or guidance, which might contribute to emotional instability or substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a history of drug use, recent emotional distress, living in a challenging household, and lacks a strong religious belief system. These factors are significant red flags that suggest she is at high risk for further issues like self-harm or substance abuse.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
