    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Age 18 is quite young, which might be a red flag because younger individuals often have less life experience and might not have developed the necessary skills or maturity to manage their behavior effectively. Being White doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are systemic issues at play, but that's probably beyond this analysis.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can sometimes be mitigated if it was a minor offense or if he's actively working on turning his life around. However, it still shows some involvement with the legal system, which might indicate potential for further issues.\n\nHis height is 6 feet 0 inches and weight 185 lbs. While these physical characteristics don't directly correlate to risk, they could be indicators of other factors like substance use or health issues, but there's no mention here that he has any health problems.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes lead to feelings of isolation, which might contribute to substance abuse or other risky behaviors if not addressed properly. However, it doesn't inherently make someone a risk without additional context.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This indicates that he hasn't completed his education, which could be a problem because education is often linked with better job opportunities and lower likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors. Not being enrolled might suggest he's struggling to find alternative opportunities.\n\nHe has held only one job during the year. Having a steady job can provide stability and reduce stress, but if he's not employed or underemployed, it could lead to financial instability or other issues. However, holding any job is generally positive compared to not having one at all.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression symptoms are positive indicators. Drug use and mental health issues can be significant contributors to risk behaviors, so their absence here is a good sign.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in a household of five. This indicates a history of living in a multi-parent household, which might suggest some level of stability or perhaps challenges that could affect his current behavior. However, the size of the household alone doesn't directly correlate to risk without more context on what happened there.\n\nHe believes in God and feels connected to a higher power. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a sense of purpose and guidance, which might help in avoiding certain risky behaviors. However, it's also possible that this belief could lead to substance abuse or other issues if not aligned with healthy values.\n\nPutting all these together, while there are some mitigating factors like no recent drug use and positive mental health, the presence of an arrest, lack of education, living alone, and limited job history might suggest a moderate risk. The single arrest doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless it's linked to violent behavior or other serious issues.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would rate this individual as having a low to moderate risk level. Therefore, my prediction is \"NO\" with a confidence of 25%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 25\n}\n```",
