    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male Hispanic. Age might not be directly predictive of risk unless there's something about being younger that suggests more potential issues, but without specific data on behavior or other factors, it's hard to say. Being Hispanic could have some socioeconomic implications, but again, I don't have enough info.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. That's a red flag because even though he wasn't convicted, an arrest can impact his future opportunities and trust in the system. But since he hasn't been convicted, maybe there's some mitigating factor here.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and weight 180 lbs. No direct info on how this relates to risk unless it affects physical labor or something else, which isn't indicated here.\n\nHe's never married and not living alone. Living with others might suggest he has support, but if he's unstable, that could be a problem too. Without knowing his living situation better, it's hard to assess.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education is a big factor. Not having a degree can limit opportunities and might correlate with higher risk of involvement in the criminal system.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having a job shows some stability, but if he's been unemployed for most of the time, that could indicate instability or lack of support.\n\nNo drug use in past four years and no depression in the past month. These are positive indicators as they suggest he's stable mentally and not using drugs, which can be a risk factor on its own.\n\nHe lived at age young in a household of 11. That's a large family size, which might indicate living with relatives or extended family. Could be a sign of instability if the household isn't supportive.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could suggest he doesn't have religious support or guidance, which might affect his decision-making and relationships.\n\nPutting it all together: one arrest, no degree, living alone (indirectly), no drug use, recent depression not reported. The lack of a degree is a strong negative factor. The single job shows some stability but maybe not enough. The large household could be a red flag if it's unstable. His belief in God might mean he doesn't have support systems.\n\nI think the factors lean towards low risk because he hasn't been convicted, has a job, no drug use, and recent depression. However, his lack of education is significant. Maybe I should give him a lower confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
