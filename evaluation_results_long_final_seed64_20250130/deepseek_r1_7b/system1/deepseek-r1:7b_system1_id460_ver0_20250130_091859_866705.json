    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old male who identifies as White. Age is often a factor in recidivism; younger individuals might be more prone to substance abuse or other issues that could lead to reoffending. Being White doesn't directly indicate risk unless there are systemic factors at play, which isn't specified here.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without a conviction can still be significant because it shows some interaction with the criminal system, which might indicate potential for future issues if he becomes more involved or faces new challenges.\n\nHis height is 6 feet and weight 204 lbs. While these physical characteristics don't directly relate to risk, they could influence things like participation in certain types of work or community settings that might affect his behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others can provide support and reduce stress, which might lower the risk of engaging in risky behaviors. However, it also depends on who those people are and their influence.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Not completing high school or being out of school can sometimes correlate with higher rates of substance abuse, unemployment, and other risky behaviors that could lead to reoffending.\n\nHe's held four jobs during the year. Having multiple job experiences might indicate some level of stability or ability to manage different environments, which could be a positive sign in terms of risk assessment.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can have both immediate and long-term effects on behavior and health. The fact that he's not feeling depressed now might suggest he's managed to stay sober, which is a good sign, but past use could still be a risk factor.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone, so I considered that earlier. It's more about the support network than anything else.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Living in a large household might provide different dynamics compared to smaller households, but it could also mean more supervision or less independence, which might influence behavior.\n\nHe believes that God has nothing to do with his personal life. This could be related to his religious background and might affect his decision-making regarding risky behaviors. If he doesn't see a higher power as influencing his choices, he might make decisions based on other values or external factors.\n\nPutting it all together: He's got some risk factors like past drug use and living in a household with multiple people, but also has positive aspects like being White (though that's not directly linked), GED, and having job experience. The lack of conviction despite an arrest is something to consider as well. However, the fact that he hasn't felt depressed recently might mitigate some of the negative factors.\n\nI'm leaning towards a low risk because several mitigating factors are present, but there are still some concerning elements like past drug use and living situation. I'd rate his risk level as moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
