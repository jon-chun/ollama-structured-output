    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male Hispanic. Age is quite young, which might not be directly related but considering his other factors, it could play a role. Being Hispanic doesn't inherently make him more or less risky, so I'll note that as neutral.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted. Arrests are a significant red flag because they indicate past criminal behavior. Convictions mean he's had legal issues before, which can affect his ability to function in society.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 7 inches and weight 185 lbs. No direct indication of health issues from this data, so I'll leave it as neutral.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. Living alone doesn't directly correlate with risk unless there are other factors like lack of support network, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education gaps can sometimes lead to unstable situations, but again, context matters. Not being enrolled might indicate he's actively seeking help, which is positive.\n\nHe has held 5 jobs during the year. Having multiple jobs shows adaptability and resourcefulness, which are generally positive traits that can contribute to stability if managed well.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Some of the time in the last month he felt extremely down. Drug use is a serious issue as it can lead to behavioral problems, health issues, and increased risk of other crimes.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in an urban area. This might suggest a stable environment initially but could also indicate potential family dysfunction or exposure to negative influences if the household isn't supportive.\n\nBelieves in God's role in his life. While spirituality can be protective, it depends on how he applies that belief and whether there are other factors indicating lack of support.\n\nPutting this all together: The key red flags here are the two prior convictions, drug use, and living situation which might indicate past instability or family issues. These factors suggest a higher risk compared to someone without such history.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up.
