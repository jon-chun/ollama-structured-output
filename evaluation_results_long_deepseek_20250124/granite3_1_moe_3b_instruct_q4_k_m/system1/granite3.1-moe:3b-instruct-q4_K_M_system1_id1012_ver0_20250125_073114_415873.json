Her living alone and lack of education or college enrollment suggest a lack of coping mechanisms and support systems. The personal circumstances involving her biological mother's early life and her belief in God's role can be seen as potential motivations or influences, but they don't necessarily mitigate the high risk profile. Drug use (marijuana and cocaine) further underscores the individual's vulnerability to engaging in risky behaviors. Her current depression and lack of employment are also concerning factors that suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending.",

She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150 and 174 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
