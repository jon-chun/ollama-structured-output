Her high school education, current enrollment in college, stable housing arrangement (living alone), and recent job stability are positive indicators. She has not engaged in substance abuse for an extended period. While her reported feelings of depression might indicate potential personal struggles, this does not necessarily equate to criminal behavior. The presence of a strong faith system and the involvement with God, though personally significant, do not appear to be indicative of high risk in terms of criminal activity. However, her recent feelings of depression for some duration require attention from mental health professionals rather than law enforcement.",
