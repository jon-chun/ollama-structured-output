However, the past drug use, particularly marijuana and cocaine, indicates potential substance abuse issues, which are risky behaviors. The fact that she has not felt depressed in the last month could be seen as a positive sign, indicating some resilience or coping skills. Her living situation with 5 family members suggests a stable upbringing, but her belief that God has nothing to do with personal events may impact her ability to cope with stress and potentially lead to risky behaviors. Therefore, while the risk is lower than for those with criminal records or recent arrests, it remains moderate due to the ongoing drug use.",
