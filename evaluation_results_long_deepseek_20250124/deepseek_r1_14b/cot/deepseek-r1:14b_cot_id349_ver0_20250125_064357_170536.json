    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this individual reoffending within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. That's on the younger side, but not extremely young. Younger offenders often have higher recidivism rates because they might be less settled in their lives or have ongoing issues. So I'd rate this as high risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can sometimes be a factor, but it's more about socioeconomic and systemic factors rather than race itself. Without more context, maybe low impact here.\n\nArrested once with a conviction. A single arrest and conviction is moderate because it shows he has a criminal history but not extensively. So medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'0\" and 212 lbs. Physical size might influence behavior or victim choices, but without more context, probably low impact.\n\nNever married, living alone. Being single and living alone could mean less support system, which is a risk factor. So high risk here because lack of social support can lead to relapse into crime.\n\nHigh school diploma and in college. Education is generally protective against recidivism. He's enrolled, so that's positive. Low impact as it suggests he's trying to better himself.\n\nNo job in the past year. Unemployment is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it reduces opportunities and increases idle time. High impact here.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana) recently. Drug use can lead to criminal activity, especially if seeking money or substances. This is medium risk.\n\nNot felt depressed recently. Mental health issues are a risk, but absence of depression might lower the risk. However, other mental health factors could still be present, so maybe low impact.\n\nGrew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of 6. Urban areas have higher crime rates, and larger families can have mixed influences. So medium risk due to potential exposure to negative environments.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious involvement is protective against recidivism because it provides structure and support. Low impact here as a positive factor.\n\nNow, considering all factors: two high risks (age 22, unemployment), three mediums (conviction history, drug use, urban background), and the rest low or positive. The strong negatives are age and unemployment, which could push towards higher risk despite his education and religious beliefs.\n\nSo I would predict \"YES\" for rearrest with about 60% confidence because while there are protective factors, the significant risks outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"22 is relatively young and may indicate ongoing issues or lack of stability\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White ethnicity generally not a strong predictor but can be influenced by socioeconomic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Single arrest and conviction indicates past criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight alone are not significant predictors of recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status_residing_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone and unmarried may indicate limited social support networks\"),\n    (\"education_enrollment_higher_education\", \"low\", \"Enrolled in college suggests potential for positive change\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"No employment history increases risk of recidivism due to lack of opportunities\"),\n    (\"drug_use_past_year\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use may correlate with higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health_depressed\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently reduces some risk\"),\n    (\"family_environment_urban_area\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and family dynamics could influence behavior\"),\n    (\"religious_influence\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
