    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to assess the risk of this individual recidivating within three years. I'm not an expert, but I'll do my best to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at each factor one by one:\n\n1. **Age**: He's 19, which is quite young. Young adults are often more impulsive and have higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\n2. **Race**: He identifies as White. I know that race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues in the criminal justice system, but it's not directly indicative of future behavior on its own. So maybe low impact here.\n\n3. **Arrest and Conviction History**: He's been arrested 8 times and convicted. A high number of arrests and convictions is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. This should be a high risk factor.\n\n4. **Height and Weight**: His stats are average, so I don't see how this directly affects his likelihood to reoffend. Probably low impact.\n\n5. **Marital Status**: He's never married and lives alone. Being unmarried can sometimes correlate with higher instability, but living alone might not necessarily mean high risk. Maybe medium? Or perhaps it's a low factor since it's more about living situation than marital status itself.\n\n6. **Education Level**: He has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education can play a role; lower education levels might be associated with higher recidivism, but without further info on employment stability or other factors, maybe medium? Or perhaps low if he's holding down jobs.\n\n7. **Employment**: He's held 2 jobs this year. Steady employment is generally a protective factor against recidivism, so that should probably be low risk.\n\n8. **Drug Use**: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for recidivism, especially if he continues using. So high impact here.\n\n9. **Mental Health**: He's felt down in the dumps recently. Mental health issues can increase the likelihood of recidivism, so that should be medium or maybe high depending on severity. Since it's recent and he's just feeling down, perhaps medium.\n\n10. **Family Background**: Grew up with both biological parents in a household of 6. Family stability can be protective, but living in a larger household might not directly impact recidivism much. Maybe low or medium? I'm leaning towards low because it's about having stable parents rather than the size of the household.\n\n11. **Religious Beliefs**: He doesn't see God as relevant to his life events. Lack of religious involvement can be a risk factor, but it's probably not as significant as other factors. So maybe medium.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n\n- High: Age (19), Arrest/Conviction History (8 times), Drug Use.\n- Medium: Mental Health (feeling down), Family Background, Religious Beliefs.\n- Low: Race, Height/Weight, Marital Status, Employment.\n\nThe strongest risk factors are his age, prior arrests, and drug use. Positive aspects like employment might slightly lower the risk but probably not enough to counteract the high-risk areas.\n\nI think he's likely to recidivate, so prediction is YES. Confidence-wise, given the combination of high, medium, and low factors, maybe around 75% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"19 years old, young age often linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"high\", \"8 arrests and convictions indicating potential for repeat offenses\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine, substance abuse is a strong risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported feelings of depression recently, which can increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in a stable home, generally protective but household size may not directly impact\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Holding steady jobs shows responsibility and stability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college enrollment; education level can influence recidivism but employment mitigates this\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married, living alone may indicate some instability but not a direct risk factor\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious involvement may contribute to higher risk\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct indicator but can relate to systemic issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
