    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over three years. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is on the younger side but not extremely low. Young adults are more likely to reoffend, so that's a medium risk.\n\nShe's female, and generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males. So this is a low risk factor.\n\nHer race is White. While there can be disparities, without specific data on racial impact, I'll consider it neutral. Low risk here.\n\nArrest history: she was arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can predict future arrests, even without convictions. That's medium risk.\n\nEducational status: She has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is often protective against recidivism, so this is low risk.\n\nEmployment: She held four jobs in the year, which shows she's able to maintain employment but might be unstable or seeking better opportunities. This could be slightly negative if job hopping continues. Medium risk.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana use in the past four years. Drug use can correlate with recidivism, so medium risk here.\n\nMental health: No depression symptoms recently. Positive mental health is protective, so low risk.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in a rural area with five siblings. Family stability might be protective but could also indicate community challenges. Let's rate this as low to medium. Maybe medium for considering the influence of environment.\n\nReligious affiliation: She doesn't feel God is involved in her life, which might suggest lower social support. Social support is important, so this is a medium risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are medium or low. The arrest and drug use are the strongest indicators pointing towards potential recidivism. However, there are several protective factors like education and employment stability. I'm on the fence but leaning towards a prediction of NO rearrest with moderate confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_20\", \"medium\", \"Young age can be a risk factor for recidivism as individuals may still be in a developmental stage\"),\n    (\"female_gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"white_ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Ethnicity alone is not a strong predictor without additional context\"),\n    (\"single_arrest_no_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Arrest history, even without conviction, can be a risk factor for future offenses\"),\n    (\"high_school_education\", \"low\", \"Higher educational attainment is generally associated with lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"multiple_jobs\", \"medium\", \"Multiple jobs may indicate instability or seeking better opportunities, which could be a slight risk\"),\n    (\"past_marijuana_use\", \"medium\", \"Substance use can correlate with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"no_depression_symptoms\", \"low\", \"Absence of depression symptoms is protective\"),\n    (\"grew_up_with_parents_in_rural_area\", \"medium\", \"Family stability and environment can influence behavior\"),\n    (\"lack_of_religious_affiliation\", \"medium\", \"Social support networks, including religion, may reduce recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
