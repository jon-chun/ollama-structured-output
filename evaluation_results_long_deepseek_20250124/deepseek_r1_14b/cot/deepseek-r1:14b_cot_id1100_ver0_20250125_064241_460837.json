    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male. Age is relevant because younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but 21 isn't extremely young. His race could be a factor, as there are known disparities in the criminal justice system, but I'm not sure how significant that is here.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Arrests without convictions can sometimes be looked at more leniently, but a conviction means he's served time or had some legal consequence. This seems like a strong indicator of higher risk because past convictions are often linked to future offenses.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly related, unless they impact his likelihood of committing certain crimes, which I don't think is the case here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean fewer social supports, which could be a risk factor, but it's not as strong as other factors like past convictions.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often associated with higher recidivism because education can serve as a protective factor against crime. So this is probably a medium to high risk factor.\n\nHe held two jobs during the year, which shows some stability but might be inconsistent if he's moving between jobs frequently. I'm not sure how significant this is on its own.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) indicates substance abuse, which can increase the likelihood of recidivism because drugs often tie into criminal behavior for obtaining them or under their influence.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps most of the time during the past month. Depression or hopelessness can be linked to higher risk as mental health issues might reduce self-control or lead to coping mechanisms like crime.\n\nGrowing up with adoptive parents and in a household of size 3, urban area. Family structure and environment can influence behavior, but without more info on family dynamics, it's hard to assign weight here. Urban areas have higher crime rates, so that could be a factor.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events, which might indicate low religious involvement. Some studies suggest that strong religious ties can reduce recidivism, so the lack thereof could be a risk.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Past arrests and convictions: High (conviction is a strong indicator)\n- Drug use: High (substance abuse often correlates with crime)\n- Lack of education: Medium\n- Mental health issues: High (hopelessness can lead to risky behavior)\n- Age: Low (21 isn't extremely high risk, but not low either)\n- Living alone and never married: Medium (some support systems lacking)\n- Urban upbringing: Low (general area factor but individual varies)\n- Religious un-involvement: Medium\n\nNow, considering all factors, especially the high ones like past convictions and drug use, it's likely he will recidivate. The confidence level is around 65% because while there are several risk factors, not all are extremely strong.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old; younger offenders may have higher recidivism rates but this is not extreme\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues increasing risk, though context needed\"),\n    (\"past_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"3 arrests and 1 conviction indicate a pattern potentially leading to further offenses\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED suggests lower educational attainment linked to higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held 2 jobs shows some stability but not significant in this context\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine indicates ongoing substance abuse, a strong risk factor\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Reported feelings of hopelessness can lead to impulsive behavior increasing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Adoptive parents in an urban area; environment may influence but not a primary factor\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious involvement might reduce protective factors against recidivism\"),\n    (\"living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without support systems could increase vulnerability to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
