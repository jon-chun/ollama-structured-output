    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information provided.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male. Age is early adulthood, which can be a time when criminal behavior might peak, but being in his early twenties isn't necessarily a strong indicator on its own. His race could be a factor, as systemic issues may contribute to higher arrest rates, but I need to consider other factors too.\n\nHe's been arrested once without a conviction. That's interesting because an arrest can still influence behavior and future interactions with the law, even if there was no conviction. It might affect his job prospects or self-esteem, potentially increasing risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly relevant unless they relate to physical altercations, but since he weighs 170 lbs at 5'10\", it's average and probably not a significant factor here.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean less social support, which could be a risk factor as he might lack someone to help him stay on track. However, being single isn't inherently bad unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college but has held two jobs this year. Having stable employment is generally protective against recidivism because it provides structure and income. This seems like a positive factor that would lower his risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, which indicates recent drug use. Drug use can correlate with criminal activity, especially if he's involved in drug markets or using while committing crimes. So this could be a moderate to high risk factor.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which is good mental health. Mental illness can increase recidivism, so the absence of depression here is positive.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother and six others might indicate a disadvantaged background. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, and living in a large household could mean limited supervision or exposure to negative influences. This seems like a moderate risk factor because it's about environment but not the most significant on its own.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal events, which might reflect a lack of strong religious ties that could act as a deterrent. Religion can sometimes be protective against crime, so this absence might slightly increase risk, but probably not by much.\n\nPutting all these together: He has some positive factors like employment and no mental health issues, but also several risk factors such as past arrest, recent drug use, living alone, urban upbringing. His age is a neutral factor since it's the peak crime period but not necessarily indicative without more info.\n\nI think his main risks are the arrest history, drug use, and environment. The positive aspects might mitigate some of these. I'd rate the arrest as high because even without conviction, it's a significant event. Drug use is moderate because recent usage could indicate ongoing issues. Urban upbringing is medium due to environmental factors, and living alone adds another medium risk.\n\nSo overall, considering all factors, he might have a moderate risk. But given that arrests and drug use are strong indicators, I'd lean towards predicting rearrest with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_21\", \"medium\", \"Early adulthood can be a period of higher criminal activity risk\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"high\", \"Systemic factors and higher arrest rates in certain communities\"),\n    (\"single_arrest_no_conviction\", \"high\", \"Arrest history may affect behavior and future interactions with law despite no conviction\"),\n    (\"employed_stably\", \"low\", \"Having stable employment is generally protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"recent_marijuana_use\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can correlate with criminal activity\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing_large_household\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and large household may indicate disadvantaged background\"),\n    (\"no_depression\", \"low\", \"Good mental health reduces risk\"),\n    (\"lives_alone\", \"medium\", \"Lack of social support may increase risk\"),\n    (\"god_irrelevance\", \"low\", \"Potential lack of religious influence, which can be protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
