    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 19-year-old Black male. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. I know that younger offenders are often at a higher risk because they might have less impulse control and be in a more unstable life situation. So that probably weighs as a high risk factor.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. Arrests can indicate a pattern of behavior, even if he's only convicted once. This seems significant, so I'd rate this as high.\n\nHis race is Black. While it's important to consider systemic factors, in terms of individual risk assessment, race itself isn't a direct factor. However, it might relate to other aspects like socioeconomic status or past experiences with the justice system. But in this context, I think it's more about his background and environment, so maybe low as a standalone factor but considered in combination with others.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism unless they're tied to other factors like gang involvement or physical altercations, which isn't mentioned here. So probably low for these.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at his age might mean he lacks a support system. Unmarried status could be neutral, but living alone might indicate some isolation, so maybe medium for that.\n\nEducation-wise, he has a high school diploma but isn't in college. That's average; many people stop after high school. So low risk here unless combined with other factors like unemployment.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment is a strong indicator of recidivism because it correlates with stress and lack of opportunities. This should be high risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years, which is drug use. While not as severe as harder drugs, it still indicates possible substance abuse issues that can contribute to criminal behavior. So medium here.\n\nHe's felt down in the dumps recently, indicating possible mental health issues or stress. Mental health struggles can lead to recidivism if left untreated. Medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in a household of eight with his biological mother suggests a potentially chaotic home environment. Large families can sometimes mean less supervision and more behavioral issues, so this is probably high.\n\nUrban upbringing might expose him to higher crime rates and more challenging environments, which can influence behavior. This could be medium, as urban areas have their own dynamics but it's not the sole factor.\n\nPutting it all together: three arrests, convictions, unemployment, chaotic family background\u2014these are strong indicators. The mental health and drug use add more risk. His age is high, but race alone isn't a direct factor here. So overall, I'd say he's at a higher risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"high\", \"Young offenders are often at higher risk of recidivism due to immaturity and lack of life experience\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests and one conviction indicate a pattern of behavior that may increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct factor but may intersect with socioeconomic factors\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism unless tied to specific behaviors\"),\n    (\"never_married_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of support systems, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"high_school_diploma_not_in_college\", \"low\", \"Education level is neutral but combined with unemployment may increase risk\"),\n    (\"unemployed_year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism due to stress and lack of opportunities\"),\n    (\"past_drug_use_marijuana\", \"medium\", \"Drug use can contribute to criminal behavior, increasing recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"recent_depression_symptoms\", \"medium\", \"Mental health struggles may lead to recidivism if untreated\"),\n    (\"large_household_size_urban_upbringing\", \"high\", \"Chaotic family environment and urban upbringing can increase exposure to negative influences\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
