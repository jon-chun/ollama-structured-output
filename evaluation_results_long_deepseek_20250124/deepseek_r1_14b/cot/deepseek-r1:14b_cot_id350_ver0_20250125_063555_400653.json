    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. That's relatively young, but not extremely so. Younger people can sometimes be more impulsive, but she's in her early twenties, which might indicate some stability, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race can be a factor, but I don't have data on how that affects recidivism rates specifically for White individuals compared to others. Maybe it doesn't contribute much here.\n\nArrested twice but no convictions. That's interesting because arrests can indicate behavior that may lead to future issues, but without convictions, it might suggest that she hasn't been serious enough to get convicted yet. So maybe this is a medium factor because arrests are concerning, but lack of convictions could mean less severity.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6\" and 190 lbs. I'm not sure how physical stats relate to recidivism. Maybe it's more about her potential for violence or other factors, but I don't see a direct link here. Probably low impact.\n\nNever married, not living alone. Being single isn't necessarily a risk factor, but not living alone might mean she's dependent on others, which could affect support systems. Maybe medium because living arrangements can influence behavior.\n\nHigh school diploma and working one job during the year. Education and employment are usually protective factors against recidivism. Having a job is good, high school diploma is standard. So this should be a low risk factor as it's positive.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not feeling depressed recently. No recent drug use is definitely a positive sign. Lack of depression could mean she's coping well mentally, which reduces risk. Both are low risk factors.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of six when young. Family background can be significant. Having stable family support might reduce recidivism, but living in a larger household could have its own dynamics\u2014maybe more chaotic? I'm not sure, but overall, it's probably a medium factor because family stability is good, but size might complicate things.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her personal events. Religious beliefs can be protective, as they often provide structure and support. This is likely a low risk factor since it's positive.\n\nConsidering all these factors: two arrests without convictions (medium), education and job (low), no drug use or depression (low), living situation (medium), family background (medium), religious belief (low). \n\nI think the main risks are her two arrests, which might suggest some propensity for problematic behavior despite no convictions. The protective factors are strong: education, employment, absence of drug use and mental health issues, and possibly her religious beliefs.\n\nSo overall, I would lean towards low risk because the positive factors outweigh the arrest history. However, there's still some uncertainty due to the arrests.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may have higher impulsivity but not extremely high\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White identity; no specific data on impact of race on recidivism in this context\"),\n    (\"arrests_without_convictions\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest potential behavior concerns\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'6\\\" and 190 lbs; no direct correlation to recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Single and not living alone may indicate dependency on others\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and one job held; positive factors\"),\n    (\"drug_use_depression\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years and no depression reported recently\"),\n    (\"family_background_household_size\", \"medium\", \"Grew up with both parents in a larger household; mixed impact on stability\"),\n    (\"religious_belief\", \"low\", \"Believes God influences personal events; generally protective\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
