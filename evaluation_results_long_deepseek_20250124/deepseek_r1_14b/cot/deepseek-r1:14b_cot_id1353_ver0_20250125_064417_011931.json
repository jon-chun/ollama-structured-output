    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break down the factors step by step. The individual is a 21-year-old Black male with three arrests but no convictions. Arrests can be a risk factor, but lack of convictions might indicate he hasn't been found guilty yet. His height and weight don't seem to contribute much here.\n\nHe isn't married and is currently not living alone, which could mean less stability. He has a GED and isn't in college, so his educational status might affect his opportunities. Having held three jobs shows some responsibility but also possible instability if he's changing jobs frequently.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana in the past four years, is a moderate factor. Substance use can be linked to recidivism. His recent mood swings and feeling down could indicate mental health issues, which is another moderate factor as mental health can influence behavior.\n\nGrowing up in a rural area with his biological mother in a household of three might suggest limited resources or community support, contributing to high risk factors related to environment. Lastly, his belief in God's role in his life could be either positive (support) or negative (if seen as fatalistic), but I'm leaning towards a moderate influence.\n\nConsidering all these, the prediction leans towards YES for rearrest with about 60% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is within a high-risk age range for recidivism\"),\n    (\"race_ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Black individuals may face systemic biases and higher arrest rates\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"3 arrests without convictions suggest potential criminal tendencies\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Not living alone but not necessarily indicating instability\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"GED certificate indicates basic education, no college enrollment\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Held 3 jobs shows some stability but frequent job changes could indicate issues\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent marijuana use and past four years of usage is a strong indicator\"),\n    (\"mental_health_status\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down indicates possible mental health struggles\"),\n    (\"family_history\", \"low\", \"Lived with biological mother in a household of 3, no specific issues mentioned\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role may provide support but not directly linked to recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently not living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 3 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 3, in a rural area.
