    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let's break down each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male. Age is a significant factor because younger offenders are generally at higher risk. However, since he's in his late teens and hasn't had many arrests yet, I'll consider this as a medium risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but without more context, it might not be the primary factor here. So, probably low impact on recidivism.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. A single arrest is concerning, but since he was convicted, it shows he followed through with his actions. This could indicate a moderate risk because past convictions are often linked to future offenses.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'3\" and 165 lbs. Physical size might influence opportunities for crime (e.g., gang recruitment), but without specific behavior indicators, I'd rate this as low.\n\nNever been married and lives alone. Lack of marital ties can sometimes mean fewer social supports, which is a risk factor. Living alone might reduce some accountability, so medium risk here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college. Education is generally protective against recidivism because it offers better opportunities. This should be low risk.\n\nHeld two jobs during the year. Employment can deter crime by providing income and structure. Stable employment is positive, so low risk.\n\nUsed drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Substance use is a strong predictor of recidivism, especially for violent crimes or drug-related offenses. This should be high risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health issues can increase recidivism, but since he's not currently depressed, this is low.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in a household of four. Family stability is protective against crime. So, low risk here.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. religiosity can sometimes reduce criminal behavior through moral frameworks. This would be low risk.\n\nNow, considering all factors: one high (drug use), several mediums (age, living alone), and the rest lows. The strongest indicator is the drug use history, which often correlates highly with recidivism, especially for substance-related crimes. His stable employment and education are positive, but they might not outweigh the drug issue.\n\nI'm leaning towards a prediction of \"YES\" for rearrest due to the significant drug use factor, despite other protective factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is relatively young and may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may face systemic issues but not a primary risk factor here\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicates some propensity for lawbreaking\"),\n    (\"physical_description\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with recidivism without behavioral context\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, living alone may reduce social support and increase risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma and college enrollment indicate potential stability\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs suggests responsibility and income stability\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression symptoms recently indicates lower risk from mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in a stable household\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine influence may provide moral framework reducing crime\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
