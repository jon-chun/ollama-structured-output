    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. I'm a bit new to criminal risk assessment, but I'll do my best.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 20-year-old Black male. Age being in their early twenties might be a factor since younger adults are often more impulsive and at higher risk for recidivism. His race could also be relevant because of potential systemic issues or biases, but I'm not entirely sure how that factors into statistical models.\n\nHe's been arrested 10 times and convicted. That seems like a significant number. Multiple arrests and convictions strongly suggest a pattern of criminal behavior, which would likely weigh heavily as a high risk factor.\n\nCurrently living alone without being married might indicate less support systems in place. Without family ties or a partner, he might have fewer reasons to stay out of trouble, so this could be a medium factor.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked with higher recidivism because education can provide alternative pathways and opportunities. This seems like a medium risk factor.\n\nNo job history in the past year suggests unemployment, which correlates with higher crime rates as individuals might turn to illegal activities for income. Unemployment is definitely a strong indicator, so this would be high risk.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially chronic or recent usage, can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior, so that's probably a medium factor. The lack of depression might be neutral here since it doesn't directly relate to recidivism in this context.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of three could mean exposure to higher crime rates and possible negative influences. Urban environments often have more opportunities for criminal activity, so that's medium risk.\n\nHe believes God has nothing to do with his personal events. This might reflect a lack of strong religious support or coping mechanisms, which can sometimes be protective factors against reoffending. So this would likely be low risk since it doesn't directly tie into behavior but could influence it.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests and convictions (high), unemployment (high), education level (medium), living alone (medium), urban background (medium), drug use (medium). The factors that might lower the risk are age being 20, which is still young but not a minor, and possibly his view on religion being low impact.\n\nI think the high-weighted factors like multiple arrests, convictions, and unemployment would significantly increase the likelihood of rearrest. So I lean towards predicting he will recidivate (YES) with a confidence level around 70-80%, considering the strong indicators but not all extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_20\", \"medium\", \"A 20-year-old is considered young and may be more impulsive, which can contribute to higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"race_black\", \"high\", \"Being Black in the U.S. context can correlate with systemic issues increasing recidivism likelihood\"),\n    (\"multiple_arrests_convictions_10\", \"high\", \"10 arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior, strongly suggesting high risk\"),\n    (\"unmarried_living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without marriage may reduce social support, potentially increasing recidivism\"),\n    (\"no_highschool Ged\", \"medium\", \"Low educational attainment is linked with higher recidivism due to fewer opportunities\"),\n    (\"unemployed_year\", \"high\", \"Unemployment correlates strongly with higher crime rates and recidivism\"),\n    (\"past_marijuana_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent drug use can impair judgment and increase criminal behavior risk\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments often expose individuals to more criminal influences\"),\n    (\"no_religious_influence\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement may not directly impact recidivism but could affect support systems\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
