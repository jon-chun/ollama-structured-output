    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's take a step-by-step approach to assess the risk factors for this individual. The goal is to predict her likelihood of rearrest within three years based on the provided information.\n\nFirst, age is 21, which is relatively young but not extremely so in terms of criminal behavior trends. However, being younger can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to immaturity and potential for continued involvement in illegal activities.\n\nShe's female. Gender does play a role; typically, females have lower recidivism rates compared to males. So this might be a mitigating factor.\n\nRace is mixed. While race itself isn't directly a risk factor, socio-economic factors tied to race can influence recidivism. However, without specific data on how her background affects her, I'd consider this as low impact unless other factors tie into it.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and convicted once. Previous convictions are strong indicators of future criminal behavior. Multiple arrests suggest ongoing issues, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is linked to higher recidivism because education can provide alternative pathways and opportunities. This should be a medium to high weight.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Marital status can both help (through support) and sometimes hinder (if the spouse is involved in crime). Since she's living with him, it could indicate stability but without more info, I'd lean towards low impact as marital support might reduce risk.\n\nEmployment: She held one job during the year. Employment is generally protective against recidivism because steady work reduces financial strain and provides structure. However, holding only one job doesn't provide much income cushion if she loses it. So this could be a medium factor but slightly positive, so maybe low impact as the job exists but we don't know its stability.\n\nDrug use: She used cocaine in the past four years and felt down recently. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because addiction can lead to further criminal activity to sustain the habit. Recent usage indicates ongoing issues, so this should be high.\n\nLiving in an urban area during youth. Urban environments often have higher crime rates and more socio-economic challenges, which can contribute to criminal behavior. This could be a medium factor as it's a background issue but not directly tied to current behavior without other factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The strongest risk factors are previous arrests/convictions (high) and recent drug use (high). Her education level is also a significant concern (medium). Age, gender, marital status, and employment have mixed effects. Urban upbringing adds another layer but isn't as strong on its own.\n\nConsidering these, the recidivism prediction leans towards YES with moderate confidence because while there are several high-risk factors, some mitigating elements like her being married and employed exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old is relatively young but not extremely low\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor, though socio-economic factors may play a role\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and one conviction indicate potential for future issues\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"No diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Married individuals may have lower recidivism due to support systems\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Having held one job shows some stability, though limited income potential\"),\n    (\"drug_usage\", \"high\", \"Recent cocaine use and current depression can lead to further criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban environments may contribute to higher crime exposure\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
