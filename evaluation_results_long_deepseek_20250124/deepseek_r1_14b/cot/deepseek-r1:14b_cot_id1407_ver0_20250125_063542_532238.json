    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this 18-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. That's a key point because younger individuals are often at higher risk due to factors like immaturity and being in a transitional phase. So that might be a high risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as Black. I know that race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but it's not directly a cause. However, I should consider any potential biases or societal factors that might affect her risk, so maybe a medium here.\n\nArrested three times without conviction\u2014arrests themselves are significant because they indicate possible ongoing behavior, even if no convictions yet. That could be high as well.\n\nHeight and weight aren't typically strong predictors of crime, so those would likely be low.\n\nNever married might not have much bearing unless marriage is a protective factor, which it can be, but for an 18-year-old, maybe medium isn't necessary\u2014probably low.\n\nLiving alone at 18 could mean less supervision. That's a risk factor, probably medium because independence can sometimes lead to more freedom to engage in risky behavior.\n\nEnrolled in school is a strong protective factor. Education often correlates with lower recidivism, so that should be high as a protective factor.\n\nEmployed for part of the year is another positive indicator. Employment can reduce the likelihood of rearrest, so that's medium.\n\nNo drug use in four years is very positive. Substance abuse is a big risk factor, so this absence would lower her risk\u2014probably high on the protective side.\n\nFeeling down recently could indicate mental health issues, which are linked to higher recidivism. That might be medium as it's concerning but not severe enough without more info.\n\nGrowing up in a household of 10 in an urban area suggests possible exposure to crime and stress. That\u2019s a moderate risk factor.\n\nBelieving God influences her life can be both positive (if it deters crime) or maybe not so protective if she feels doomed. It might have a small effect, so low.\n\nPutting this all together: the negative factors are her age, arrests, living alone, and mental health, while positives include education, employment, no drug use. The net seems mixed but leaning towards higher risk because of her multiple arrests and age despite positive factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old is a high-risk age due to immaturity and potential for continued involvement in criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues, but race alone isn't a direct risk factor.
