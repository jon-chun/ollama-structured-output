    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is on the lower end of adulthood. Younger adults might have higher risks due to impulsive behavior, but it's not definitive yet.\n\nHe identifies as Black, and while race isn't a direct indicator, systemic factors can influence outcomes, so this should be noted as a medium factor.\n\nArrest history: he was arrested once but no conviction. Arrests without convictions can sometimes indicate minor offenses or successful legal representation, which might lower the risk slightly, but it's still a relevant point.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly impact recidivism, so that's low.\n\nLiving alone could be a red flag as lack of support might increase the chance of relapse into criminal behavior. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nNo prior marriage\u2014marital status can influence stability, but without a spouse, it doesn't necessarily mean higher risk on its own. So maybe low here unless other factors combine.\n\nEducation: he has a high school diploma and is in college. Higher education generally correlates with lower recidivism rates, so this should be a strong protective factor\u2014high impact.\n\nNo job history during the year suggests possible barriers to employment, which can increase recidivism risk if he lacks income sources. This would be a medium factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Even though it's not always directly linked to violent crime, any drug use can indicate potential for substance-related offenses or dependency issues\u2014medium impact.\n\nMental health: feeling down in the dumps recently could indicate stress or possible undiagnosed mental health issues, which might affect his behavior and risk of recidivism\u2014medium.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. While urban areas can have higher crime rates, stable family structures are protective factors. So this is a bit conflicting; maybe low impact as it's more about the environment than personal history.\n\nReligious belief might provide him with support and reduce recidivism risk, so that's a high positive factor.\n\nPutting it all together, the protective factors like education and religion seem strong, but the arrest, unemployment, and mental health issues could be negatives. I'm leaning towards predicting he will not rearrest, but there's still some uncertainty. Confidence level is around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"20 years old is relatively young, but not extremely low risk in this context\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues that could influence outcomes\"),\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential but no definitive outcome\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might indicate lack of support systems\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married doesn't directly correlate to higher risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Enrolled in college suggests better prospects and lower risk\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"No jobs during the year may indicate barriers or instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use could be a risk factor but not directly linked to violent crime\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down indicates possible stress or mental health issues\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in an urban area, which may have mixed influences\"),\n    (\"religiousbelief\", \"high\", \"Religious beliefs can be a protective factor against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 169 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. He has held no jobs during the year.
