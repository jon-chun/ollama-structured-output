    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let's break down each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old Hispanic male. Age is a factor because younger individuals might have less stability and more tendency towards recidivism. But being Hispanic might also be a consideration in some contexts regarding systemic issues, though I'm not sure how significant that is here without more data.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted. That's a high number of arrests, which usually indicates a higher risk for future offenses. The fact that he was convicted shows that the previous charges were taken seriously, so this should weigh heavily as a high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem directly relevant unless they relate to the type of crime, but there's no info on that. So I'd probably consider this low impact.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Not being married might mean fewer social ties, which can be a moderate risk factor since strong social support networks are protective against recidivism. Living alone could also be a negative if he lacks supervision or positive influences at home.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is often linked to higher recidivism because it limits employment opportunities and increases stress. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Having some work history is good, but only one job might indicate instability if he's lost jobs before or if this is his first attempt at employment. So maybe medium here.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (cocaine) is another significant red flag. Substance abuse correlates highly with recidivism because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior to sustain the habit. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month is positive, but mental health issues that aren't reported now might still be present. Since he's not showing signs currently, this could be low.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Family structure and environment can influence behavior. Rural areas might have less access to resources, which could contribute to risk. This would likely be a medium factor because it combines family dynamics and environmental challenges.\n\nLastly, he believes God has a role in his life. Religious involvement is generally seen as protective against crime, so this should be a low risk factor but potentially positive.\n\nPutting all these together: high factors include prior convictions, drug use, and lack of education; medium factors are living alone, age, and family background; low factors are height/weight, employment status, mental health, and religious beliefs. The high negatives outweigh the positives, so I'd predict rearrest with around 70% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"18 years old may indicate less stability and higher risk for recidivism compared to older individuals\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic identity alone is not a significant predictor of recidivism without additional context\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"6 arrests with convictions indicates a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation to recidivism based on height and weight alone\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may indicate fewer social ties, which can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could suggest limited support systems\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college limits opportunities and increases stressors\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held 1 job during the year shows some stability but may indicate potential instability if new\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent cocaine use is a strong indicator of potential recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living in a rural household with mother and siblings may present challenges\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's role may provide some protective factors against recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
