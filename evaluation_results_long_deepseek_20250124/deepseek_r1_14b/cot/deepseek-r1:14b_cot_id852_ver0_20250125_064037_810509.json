    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information given.\n\nFirst, she's a 20-year-old Black female. Age is quite young, which might mean she has more time ahead, but being Black could be a factor in recidivism rates due to systemic issues, though I know that's a sensitive topic and might not be directly applicable here. \n\nShe was arrested once and convicted. Arrest history is usually significant because having been arrested before can indicate a higher likelihood of future offenses. However, it's only one arrest, so maybe not as high a risk as someone with multiple arrests.\n\nHer physical stats: 5'2\" and 172 lbs. I'm not sure how weight affects recidivism directly. Maybe if there are health issues, but that might be a stretch. Probably low impact here.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone could mean she has less support, which might increase risk factors, but it's not a direct indicator of criminal behavior. So I'm thinking this is a medium factor because social support can influence recidivism, but it's not the strongest factor.\n\nEducation-wise, she has a high school diploma and is in a 2-year college. Education is generally protective against recidivism. Higher education often correlates with lower crime rates, so this should be a low risk factor.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. Employment stability can reduce recidivism because it provides income and structure. However, holding multiple jobs might indicate instability or that she's juggling too much, which could lead to stress. But overall, employment is positive, so probably medium impact.\n\nShe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use, especially illegal substances like marijuana (depending on the laws), can be a risk factor. However, since it's only marijuana and recent usage isn't indicating a current problem, maybe this is low or medium. I'm leaning towards medium because any drug use can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in a household of size 3 in a rural area. Family structure and environment can influence recidivism. Rural areas might have less access to resources, which could be a risk factor. But being raised with a biological mother might provide some stability, so I'm not sure. Maybe low impact because it's more about the environment than direct factors.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: one arrest, education and employment are positive, drug use is present but limited, living alone might be a slight concern. I think the main risk here is the prior conviction. Research shows that having a criminal history is a strong predictor of recidivism. However, her other factors like education and employment could mitigate some of that risk.\n\nSo putting it all together, I would assign weights as follows: Prior Conviction (High), Age (Low but she's young), Drug Use (Medium), Employment (Medium), Education (Low), Living Situation (Medium). \n\nI'm not sure about the exact confidence level. Maybe around 50% because while there is a prior conviction, other factors are protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"high\", \"A single arrest and conviction can be a significant risk factor for rearrest.\"),\n    (\"age_20_years\", \"low\", \"Age is not strongly predictive of recidivism in this case, though being young may indicate higher potential for change or continued involvement in risky behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use_marijuana\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use can be a moderate risk factor as it indicates possible ongoing substance-related issues that could influence behavior\"),\n    (\"living_alone_unmarried\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and unmarried may reduce social support networks, which can increase vulnerability to recidivism\"),\n    (\"high_school_and_college\", \"low\", \"Higher education is generally protective against recidivism, suggesting a lower risk here\"),\n    (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Having held multiple jobs indicates some stability but could also signal stress or instability that might contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"rural_living_family_structure\", \"low\", \"While rural living and family structure can have some influence, they are less directly predictive of recidivism compared to other factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
