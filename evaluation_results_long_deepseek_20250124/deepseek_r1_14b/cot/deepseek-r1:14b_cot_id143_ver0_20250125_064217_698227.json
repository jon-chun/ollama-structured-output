    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this 22-year-old female reoffending in the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can be a red flag, but without a conviction, it might indicate that the charges were dropped or acquitted. So maybe her criminal history isn't as strong as someone with convictions. I think this is low risk because no conviction means less proven guilt.\n\nNext, she's white. Race alone shouldn't determine risk, but in some contexts, it can be a factor due to systemic issues. However, I don't want to overemphasize this. It might have a slight effect, so medium seems too high; perhaps low is better here.\n\nShe's single and living alone. Being single isn't necessarily a bad sign, but living alone might mean less social support. This could be a minor factor, so maybe low or medium? I'm leaning towards low because other factors are more significant.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree and isn't enrolled now. Education is usually protective against recidivism. People with higher education tend to have better job prospects and are less likely to commit crimes. So this should be a strong protective factor, making it low risk.\n\nShe held four jobs in the past year. Multiple jobs might indicate instability or that she's struggling to find steady employment. Unstable work can be a stressor leading to crime. I think this is medium risk because job hopping could signal issues.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use, especially illegal substances like cocaine, is a significant red flag for recidivism. This should be high risk as substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior.\n\nIn the past month, she felt down so much that nothing cheered her up. Depression or low mood can impair judgment and increase stress, potentially leading to criminal activity. So this is medium risk because mental health issues are important but might not be as severe as drug use.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. Urban environments can have higher crime rates, but having stable parental figures might mitigate that. I'm on the fence here\u2014maybe low or medium? Considering the urban aspect, it's probably medium risk.\n\nLastly, she considers God has nothing to do with her personal events. Lack of religious involvement can be a factor since religion often provides support and reduces recidivism. But this is a weaker effect, so maybe low risk.\n\nNow, putting it all together: most factors are low or medium except drug use, which is high. However, education is protective, so overall, I'm not sure she'll reoffend. My confidence isn't very high, maybe around 60%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old is a common age for criminal behavior but not indicative alone\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Female generally has lower recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race typically has lower average recidivism rates, though context matters\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction suggests potential but no proven guilt\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Bachelor's degree is protective against recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Four jobs in a year may indicate instability or stressors\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially cocaine, correlates with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Reported depressive symptoms can increase risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Grew up with both parents in a stable household\"),\n    (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement may have minor impact\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Single and living alone, but no known support issues\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
