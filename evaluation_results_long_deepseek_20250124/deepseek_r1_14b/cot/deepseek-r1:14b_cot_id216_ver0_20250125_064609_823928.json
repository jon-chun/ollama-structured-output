    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk of this individual recidivating within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. That's relatively young but not super low; some factors might have more weight here.\n\nGender: She's female. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males, so that should be a mitigating factor.\n\nRace is Black. While race isn't directly a risk factor, systemic issues can play a role, but I'm not sure how to weigh this without more context. Maybe low since it's more about societal factors rather than individual behavior.\n\nArrest and conviction history: 4 arrests with convictions. That's significant because prior convictions are strong predictors of future offenses. This should be high risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant, so probably not a factor at all.\n\nMarital status: Never married. Unmarried individuals might have different recidivism rates, but it's unclear if this is a direct factor. Maybe low or neutral.\n\nLiving alone could indicate less social support, which might increase risk. So I'll consider that medium.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests educational issues, which can be linked to higher recidivism. That should be high.\n\nUnemployed for the year: Unemployment is a known risk factor, so this is definitely high.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in past four years. While it's not violent crime, drug use can indicate substance abuse issues, which might increase recidivism. Medium here.\n\nNo depression symptoms recently: That's positive but not directly related to recidivism. So low or neutral.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in a household of 6 in an urban area. Large family size and urban setting could mean more exposure to crime, so that might be medium.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with her personally: Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor but not always directly related. So maybe low or neutral.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, the high points are prior arrests/convictions, unemployment, and lack of education. Drug use is medium. Age might be slightly mitigating but still young enough to be at risk.\n\nPutting it together, there's a moderate to high chance she could recidivate. I'm going to estimate confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old is relatively young but not extremely low-risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race itself is not a direct risk factor but can be influenced by systemic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"4 arrests with convictions indicate significant prior criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation between height/weight and recidivism\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married may not directly impact recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone could suggest limited social support, potentially increasing risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma/GED and no college enrollment indicates potential barriers to employment and stability\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the year suggests economic instability, a known recidivism risk factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use may indicate substance abuse issues which can correlate with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No reported depression in the past month is neutral\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up in a large household in an urban area, potentially indicating exposure to adverse environments\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Personal spirituality may provide some protective factors but not directly predictive of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
