    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of recidivism for this individual. He's a 21-year-old Black male with several strikes against him. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21. That's on the younger side, but not extremely so. Young adults are still at a higher risk for recidivism compared to older individuals, so that might be a medium factor.\n\nHe's identified as Black. I know that race can sometimes correlate with higher arrest rates due to systemic issues rather than inherent factors. So this could be a high or medium factor depending on how much weight is given to demographic data.\n\nArrested 19 times and convicted. Wow, that's a lot. High number of arrests and convictions are strong indicators of recidivism risk. This should definitely be a high factor because multiple arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of criminal behavior.\n\nHe weighs 210 lbs. Body weight alone isn't directly linked to crime unless it's related to other factors like obesity or health issues, which might not be relevant here. So this is probably low impact.\n\nNever married and living alone. Marital status can influence recidivism; being married often reduces the risk because of family ties. Living alone might mean less support, so maybe a medium factor?\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment is a known risk factor because it limits employment opportunities and can contribute to cycles of poverty and crime. That's definitely a high factor.\n\nNo jobs during the year. Unemployment is another strong predictor of recidivism since it reduces the ability to support oneself legally. High impact here as well.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana). Drug use, especially recent, can increase recidivism risk either through relapse into drug-related crimes or other associated criminal behavior. Medium factor.\n\nIn the past month, he's felt down and nothing cheered him up. Depression symptoms can lead to increased stress, possibly contributing to criminal\u884c\u4e3a as a coping mechanism. So medium impact here.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of 8 in an urban area. Large households might indicate limited supervision or higher exposure to negative influences. Urban areas have higher crime rates, so this could be a medium factor.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with what happens to him personally. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism, but it's not a direct indicator. Maybe low impact unless he's actively involved in religious support systems, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting all this together, the factors with high weight are number of arrests/convictions, educational attainment, and unemployment. Medium include age, race, depression symptoms, living situation, and drug use. Low are weight and religious beliefs.\n\nConsidering the strongest indicators (high), I'd predict a high risk of rearrest within three years. My confidence is around 75% because while some factors are strong, others like his potential for change or external support aren't considered here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults have a higher recidivism rate compared to older individuals\"),\n    (\"race\", \"high\", \"Demographic factors can influence systemic issues and risk\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"19 arrests/convictions indicate a strong pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Body weight not directly linked to crime without other factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\u5c45\u4f4f\u60c5\u51b5\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce support systems\"),\n    (\"educational_ attainment\", \"high\", \"Low education limits legal employment options\"),\n    (\"unemployment\", \"high\", \"High risk factor for recidivism due to lack of legal income\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent marijuana use can increase criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression symptoms may contribute to stress and potential crime\"),\n    (\"family\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u5c45\u4f4f\u73af\u5883\", \"medium\", \"Large household and urban area exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Potential protective factor, but not directly indicated\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
