    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19, which is young but not a minor anymore. Juvenile records might be sealed, so that's a plus, making it low risk here.\n\nHe's white, which generally isn't a direct risk factor on its own unless there are underlying issues like discrimination or community factors. I'll rate this as low for now.\n\nArrested twice without convictions. Arrests can still indicate potential criminal behavior, even if not convicted. This is a medium risk factor because it shows some inclination but no proven guilt.\n\nHeight and weight don't directly correlate with crime rates, so that's low.\n\nLiving alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a slight risk, but he has held two jobs, indicating responsibility. So I'll split this into two factors: living alone as medium and having steady employment as low.\n\nGED instead of high school diploma might indicate some educational challenges, but it's still a recognized qualification. Not a significant risk factor, so low.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana) is relevant because substance abuse often correlates with criminal behavior. This should be high.\n\nHe has experienced depression symptoms recently, which can impair judgment and increase risky behaviors. Mental health issues are serious, so this is high.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with a larger household size might expose him to more negative influences, but it's not definitive. I'll rate this as low.\n\nBelieving that God plays a role in his life suggests he has some form of belief system, which can be stabilizing. This is probably low risk.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high points are drug use and mental health, while others like arrests, living alone, and urban upbringing contribute but aren't as strong. The overall risk seems moderate, so a prediction of YES with about 55% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age_19\", \"low\", \"19 years old; not a minor but still young\"),\n    (\"race_white\", \"low\", \"White race is generally not a direct risk factor for recidivism on its own\"),\n    (\"arrests_without_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction suggest potential inclination towards criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"height_and_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with crime propensity\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate lack of social support or supervision\"),\n    (\"steady_employment\", \"low\", \"Having held two jobs indicates responsibility and stability\"),\n    (\"GED_certificate\", \"low\", \"Possessing a GED suggests some educational attainment but not necessarily higher education involvement\"),\n    (\"past_marijuana_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use can be indicative of potential criminal behavior or substance abuse issues\"),\n    (\"recent_depression_symptoms\", \"high\", \"Feelings of depression and hopelessness may impair judgment and increase risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"urban_upbringing_household_of_4\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing in a household of four is not inherently risky but could indicate exposure to negative influences\"),\n    (\"religious_belief_in_god\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a sense of purpose and reduce risk of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 55\n}\n```",
