    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. That's pretty young, and I know that younger offenders are often at a higher risk because they might not have stable lives yet. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nHe's male, which in general can be a risk factor because males make up the majority of arrests. But this isn't as significant as age, so maybe medium here.\n\nRace is White. I don't know if race itself is a direct indicator, but it might relate to systemic issues or other factors, so perhaps low impact on its own.\n\nArrested once but not convicted. Arrests can indicate potential for future offenses, even without a conviction. So that's probably a medium factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education is usually protective against recidivism, so having a diploma is better than no education, but not as strong as higher education. Maybe low here.\n\nCurrently living alone, never married. Living alone might mean less support, which can be risky. So that's medium.\n\nEmployed for one job during the year. Stable employment is good and reduces risk, so this should be a high factor because it's protective.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a significant indicator of potential recidivism, especially if he has dependencies or continues using. That's definitely high risk.\n\nNo depression reported recently. Mental health issues can increase risk, but since he isn't feeling depressed now, this might be low or neutral. Maybe low because it's not an active issue.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Family support is generally good, but living in a larger family and urban setting could have its own dynamics. Maybe medium as the environment can have mixed influences.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Spirituality can be protective, so that's low risk because it might deter him from criminal behavior.\n\nPutting all these together: age (high), male (medium), race (low), arrest without conviction (medium), education (low), living alone (medium), employment (high), drug use (high), mental health (low), family background (medium), spirituality (low).\n\nMost factors are medium or high, with several high points. Employment and spirituality are positive but not enough to offset the negatives. So I think he's likely to recidivate, hence \"YES\". Confidence is around 70% because there are strong risk factors but some protective ones too.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"20 years old; young adults often have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"males generally have higher recidivism rates than females\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"race is not a direct indicator of risk but may relate to systemic factors\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest\", \"medium\", \"one arrest without conviction indicates potential but not definitive risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"high school diploma is somewhat protective, but no college enrollment\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"lack of social support can increase risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"stable employment is a strong protective factor\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"past use of marijuana and cocaine increases risk for recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no reported depression in the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"growing up with both parents in an urban area can have mixed influences\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"belief in God may provide some protective influence\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
