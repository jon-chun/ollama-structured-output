    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to try to figure out whether this person is likely to rearrest in the next three years. Let's break down each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age: He's 22, which is relatively young but not super young. Some studies suggest that younger offenders have higher recidivism rates, so maybe that's a medium risk.\n\nArrest history: He has been arrested five times and convicted. That seems significant. In the examples given, people with multiple arrests were more likely to re-offend. So this should be high risk.\n\nEducation: He has a GED. I'm not sure if GED is better than no diploma, but compared to having a high school diploma or higher, it might still count as low because maybe there's less educational attainment here.\n\nEmployment: He only held one job during the year. Unstable employment can be a risk factor. In examples, people with few jobs were sometimes more likely to re-offend, so this is medium.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Drug use often correlates with higher recidivism, especially when it's ongoing. That's probably high.\n\nResidential stability: He's currently living alone, which might mean he doesn't have strong social ties or support systems. Maybe that's low because having a stable home life can help reduce recidivism, but since he's living alone, perhaps it's medium.\n\nFamily background: He lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. I'm not sure how this affects; maybe it's low because having two parents might provide some stability, but the examples didn't always show that as a strong factor.\n\nSpirituality: He believes God influences his life. Some studies suggest spirituality can be protective, so perhaps that's low as a risk factor, but in the examples, it wasn't a major one either.\n\nNow, considering all these factors, especially the high arrest and drug use history, I think the likelihood of rearrest is higher. But looking at previous examples where similar factors led to 'NO', like example 27 or 30, maybe there are conflicting elements here. However, given his multiple arrests, ongoing drug use, and limited job stability, I'm leaning towards a prediction of YES.\n\nConfidence would be around 65%, because while some factors point towards rearrest, others like spirituality and family background might mitigate it somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"22 years old; younger individuals may have higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"number_of_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"5 arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"GED certificate indicates basic education but no further education\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"held only 1 job in the past year, indicating potential instability\"),\n    (\"drug_use_recency\", \"high\", \"used marijuana and cocaine recently, which often correlates with recidivism\"),\n    (\"residential_stability\", \"medium\", \"currently living alone; may indicate limited social support\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"lived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child\"),\n    (\"spirituality_importance\", \"low\", \"considers God influential, which might have mitigating effects\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
