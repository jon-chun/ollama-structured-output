    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to predict whether this 21-year-old White male will recidivate within three years based on the given risk factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested twice and convicted once. Looking at the examples, multiple arrests and convictions seem significant. For instance, in Example 18, someone with two arrests and one conviction had a \"NO\" outcome. But others with more arrests like Examples 29 (17 arrests) or 30 (3 arrests) were \"YES.\" So two arrests might be moderate but not the highest.\n\nHe's currently living alone and has never been married. In previous cases, living arrangements didn't seem to directly correlate except in Example 16 where living with parents led to a \"NO,\" while others varied. So this might be low impact.\n\nHe holds a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education can influence recidivism\u2014some examples show higher education leading to lower risk, like Example 27 having no job and no diploma leading to \"NO.\" But since he has a diploma, maybe it's slightly positive but not a strong factor.\n\nHe's been using marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is often a high-risk factor. For example, several cases with drug use ended up as \"YES,\" while those without drugs were more likely \"NO.\" So this should be weighted highly.\n\nNo history of depression in the past month\u2014so mental health isn't an issue here, which might lower risk slightly.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents. Family stability can play a role; some examples show stable families leading to lower recidivism. However, others didn't have this factor but still had varying outcomes. So maybe medium impact?\n\nBelieves God influences his life\u2014spirituality sometimes correlates with lower recidivism. Examples like 16 and 30 had similar beliefs and varied outcomes. It might be a slight positive factor, so low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: two arrests, drug use are significant. Education and family stability help mitigate but aren't enough to counteract the higher-risk factors. So I'd lean towards \"YES\" with medium confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Number of arrests (2)\", \"high\", \"Two prior arrests can indicate a pattern, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"Conviction history (1)\", \"medium\", \"A single conviction may contribute but not as strongly as multiple arrests\"),\n    (\"Drug use in past four years (marijuana)\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use is linked to higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Living alone\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation, but may indicate limited support systems\"),\n    (\"Never married\", \"low\", \"Marital status generally has a weak link to recidivism\"),\n    (\"High school diploma\", \"low\", \"Education can be protective but not the strongest factor here\"),\n    (\"Urban upbringing with both parents\", \"medium\", \"Family stability may reduce risk, but urban factors could increase it\"),\n    (\"Believes God influences life\", \"low\", \"Spirituality may have a mitigating effect, though evidence is mixed\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
