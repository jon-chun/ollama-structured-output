    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this 22-year-old female is likely to be rearrested within three years. Let me break down each of her risk factors based on the examples provided.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice and convicted. Looking at the previous cases, arrest history seems significant. For example, in case #1 with two arrests, the outcome was YES. So, two arrests might be a medium factor here.\n\nNext, she weighs between 150-174 lbs. I don't see weight being a direct factor in the examples, so maybe this is low impact.\n\nShe's never married and living alone. Many of the previous cases involved people living alone or not with family, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be a strong indicator on its own. So, probably low.\n\nShe completed an associate/junior college but isn't enrolled now. Education can sometimes be protective against recidivism, so maybe this is low as she has some education but isn't continuing.\n\nShe's held three jobs during the year. Employment is usually seen as a positive factor, reducing the risk of rearrest. So, high weight here for being employed.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use was present in many YES cases, so this could be a medium or high factor. It's definitely significant because substance abuse often leads to criminal behavior.\n\nShe felt down in the dumps some times in the last month. Mental health issues were present in some of the NO cases but might have contributed when combined with other factors. So, low weight here unless exacerbated by others.\n\nLived with her biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area. Family dynamics vary; sometimes larger families can be a risk factor, but it's not clear. Maybe medium if urban environment is considered high crime.\n\nFeels that God has something to do with what happens to her. In the examples, some had this belief and were either YES or NO. It might have more of an impact on behavior rather than recidivism, so perhaps low.\n\nNow, combining these: she has two arrests (medium), drug use (medium/high), employment (high). The positive factors like employment might mitigate some risks but her drug use is a strong indicator. Mental health and family dynamics are present but not as strong. I think the key factors here are prior convictions, recent drug use, and lack of continued education. \n\nLooking at similar cases, those with multiple arrests, drug use, and no ongoing education were more likely to recidivate. However, her employment might lower that risk a bit.\n\nI'm leaning towards prediction: NO. Confidence is around 60% because while she has several risk factors, the employment could be protective.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History: arrested 2 times and convicted\", \"medium\", \"Previous arrests and convictions are significant indicators of potential recidivism; similar cases with multiple arrests often had higher rearrest rates\"),\n    (\"Drug Use in Past Four Years: used marijuana and cocaine\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior, as seen in several examples where drug use correlated with rearrest\"),\n    (\"Employment Status: held 3 jobs during the year\", \"high\", \"Employment can be a protective factor against recidivism, though it may not fully mitigate other risks\"),\n    (\"Education Level: completed associate/junior college but not enrolled now\", \"low\", \"While education is generally protective, lack of enrollment might slightly increase risk\"),\n    (\"Living Situation: currently living alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone is common and doesn't strongly indicate recidivism on its own\"),\n    (\"Mental Health: felt down in the dumps some times in the past month\", \"low\", \"Mental health issues are present but may not be a primary driver without other factors\"),\n    (\"Family Dynamics: lived with biological mother in an urban area\", \"medium\", \"Urban environment and family dynamics might contribute to risk, though not as significant as drug use or employment\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/Belief: considers God's role in her life\", \"low\", \"This factor is less directly correlated with recidivism compared to others\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
