    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given examples. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the factors:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: Arrested once but not convicted.\n2. **Education Status**: No diploma or GED and not enrolled in college.\n3. **Employment**: Held 2 jobs during the year.\n4. **Drug Use**: Used marijuana in the past four years.\n5. **Residency**: Living alone, previously lived with mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area.\n6. **Mental Health**: Not felt depressed in the past month.\n7. **Religious Belief**: Considers God has something to do with what happens to him.\n\nNow, I'll analyze each factor based on the examples provided.\n\n**1. Arrest History (Low Weight):** In the examples, arrest counts vary, but having just one arrest without a conviction seems less severe. Cases like Example 6 had similar factors and resulted in NO.\n\n**2. Education Status (High Weight):** Lack of education is a strong indicator. Examples with no diploma and not enrolled, especially if combined with other risks, often led to YES. For instance, Examples 7, 15, and 29 showed such cases resulting in NO or mixed outcomes, but generally, lower education correlates with higher recidivism.\n\n**3. Employment (Medium Weight):** Having held two jobs is positive, indicating stability. However, in some examples, like Example 6, employment didn't prevent rearrest, so it's a medium protective factor but not strong enough on its own.\n\n**4. Drug Use (High Weight):** Marijuana use is significant. In many examples, drug use was present and often correlated with YES outcomes, especially when combined with other risks. For example, Examples 3, 10, 28, and 30 had drug use leading to YES.\n\n**5. Residency (Low Weight):** Living alone might indicate independence but could also mean lack of support. Urban residence is common in examples, so it's a low weight unless other factors are strong.\n\n**6. Mental Health (Low Weight):** No depression reported, which is positive. In examples, mental health issues sometimes led to NO, but absence here is neutral.\n\n**7. Religious Belief (Medium Weight):** Believing God influences events might offer support but isn't a strong predictor. Examples didn't consistently show this factor affecting outcomes, so medium weight.\n\nConsidering all factors, the high weights are on Education and Drug Use. The person's lack of education and recent drug use are significant negatives. Employment is positive, but not enough to counterbalance the others. Arrest history is minimal but still a concern.\n\nLooking at examples with similar factors: Example 6 had no diploma, held two jobs, used drugs, lived alone, urban, etc., and resulted in NO. But other cases like Examples 10 and 28 with more arrests or convictions led to YES. However, this case has only one arrest without conviction.\n\nI'm leaning towards a prediction of \"NO\" but there's some uncertainty because the education and drug use are strong negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"low\", \"Only arrested once without conviction, less severe than multiple arrests or convictions\"),\n    (\"Education Status\", \"high\", \"No diploma/GED and not enrolled in college, a strong negative indicator\"),\n    (\"Employment\", \"medium\", \"Held two jobs, positive but not enough to outweigh negatives\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Used marijuana recently, significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"Residency\", \"low\", \"Living alone in urban area, less impactful than other factors\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported, neutral\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"medium\", \"Potential support but not strong predictor\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
