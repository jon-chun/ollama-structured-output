    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out how to predict whether this 19-year-old Hispanic male will be rearrested within three years. I'm going to go through each of his risk factors step by step, just like the examples provided.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested twice and convicted. Looking back at the examples, multiple arrests and convictions seem to be a strong indicator. For instance, in Example 28, someone with 7 arrests and convictions was predicted \"YES.\" So I think this is a high-weight factor because past behavior often indicates future behavior.\n\nNext, he doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. In the examples, lack of education came up several times. People without education might struggle more with employment and other aspects, which can lead to recidivism. So I'd rate this as medium weight because it's a significant factor but not the strongest.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs recently and isn't depressed. Drug use was present in many \"YES\" cases, so the absence here is positive. Similarly, no depression reduces risk factors. These are both low-weight factors because they're more mitigating than contributing to recidivism.\n\nHe's currently living alone, which I don't recall being a major factor in the examples. It might be neutral or slightly negative since having support systems can help prevent recidivism. But since it's not explicitly mentioned as a significant factor, I'll give it a low weight.\n\nGrowing up in a household of size 5 with his mother\u2014this is interesting. In some cases, larger families might have more challenges, but others could provide support. It doesn't seem to strongly indicate either way, so maybe a medium weight because family dynamics can influence behavior, but the data isn't clear enough here.\n\nLastly, he believes God influences his life. In examples, this factor sometimes came up with \"YES\" outcomes, but it's not consistently strong. I'll consider it low weight since it might not have a direct impact on recidivism.\n\nPutting all these together: high for past convictions, medium for education level and family background, low for other factors. Since his main issue is multiple arrests/convictions, which was a strong indicator in the examples, even though he has some positive factors like no drug use and living alone, I think the risk of rearrest is higher.\n\nI'll give this a 65% confidence because while there are mitigating factors, the past convictions are significant.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests/Convictions\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions strongly indicate higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can contribute to challenges in employment, increasing recidivism likelihood.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"low\", \"Currently living alone may have neutral impact but could be slightly negative without support systems.\"),\n    (\"Household Dynamics\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a household of size 5 with mother might present challenges or support depending on context, moderately influencing risk.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God's influence is not strongly correlated with recidivism in examples, thus low weight.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
