    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I'm supposed to predict whether a 21-year-old White male will rearrest within three years based on the given risk factors. He's been arrested twice and convicted once. Let me break down each factor.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21, which is young but not super young in terms of recidivism trends. I think being younger can sometimes be a higher risk, but since he's in his early twenties, it might still have some impact. Maybe medium weight here because it's somewhat significant but not the highest.\n\nArrest history: he has two arrests and one conviction. Looking at the examples, people with multiple arrests or convictions often had outcomes of YES. For instance, Example 28 had 7 arrests and was a YES, while someone with fewer arrests like Example 16 (arrested once) was NO. So having two arrests might be a medium factor.\n\nEmployment: he's held one job during the year. In examples, consistent employment often led to lower recidivism. For example, Example 29 had no jobs and was a NO, while someone with multiple jobs like Example 28 was a YES. So having some employment is positive but not perfect. Maybe low weight because it's only one job.\n\nEducation: he has a high school diploma. In the examples, higher education seemed to help reduce recidivism. For example, Examples 16 and 27 had no diplomas and were NOs. So this might be a medium factor as education is moderately protective.\n\nDrug use: he used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. This seems significant because drug use often correlates with higher recidivism. Looking at examples, many who used drugs ended up with YES outcomes, like Example 28. So this could be a high weight factor.\n\nLiving situation: currently living alone. In some examples, not living alone seemed protective (like Examples 16 and 30), while others didn't specify but might have had more support. Living alone can be isolating, so maybe low to medium weight here as it's somewhat concerning but not the most impactful.\n\nFamily background: lived with both biological parents in a rural household of size three. Family stability is generally good for reducing recidivism. Examples like 16 and 27 had less stable families and were NOs. So this is likely a medium to high factor as family support can be protective.\n\nSpirituality: considers God's role in his life. In examples, some with strong beliefs were NOs (like Example 30). Spirituality might have a low weight because it's not a direct risk factor but could offer some protection.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest factors are drug use and possibly arrest history. The protective factors are education, family background, and perhaps spirituality. Since he has significant positive and negative factors, I'm leaning towards predicting YES with moderate confidence, maybe around 60-70%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (21 years)\", \"medium\", \"Young age can be a risk factor for recidivism as individuals in their early twenties are still developing socially and emotionally.\"),\n    (\"Arrest History (2 arrests, 1 conviction)\", \"high\", \"Multiple arrests and convictions strongly correlate with higher recidivism rates, especially when there are multiple incidents.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status (held 1 job)\", \"low\", \"Having some employment history is generally protective against recidivism, but holding only one job during the year may indicate limited stability or engagement.\"),\n    (\"Education (high school diploma)\", \"medium\", \"Possessing a high school diploma can be moderately protective against recidivism as it indicates some level of educational attainment and may correlate with better opportunities.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (marijuana and cocaine in past 4 years)\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism, as substance abuse often correlates with continued criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation (living alone)\", \"low\", \"Living alone can be associated with higher risk due to lack of social support, but it's not the most impactful factor compared to others like drug use or arrest history.\"),\n    (\"Family Background (lived with both biological parents in a rural household)\", \"medium\", \"Having stable family background, especially living with both parents, is generally protective against recidivism and can be considered moderately influential.\"),\n    (\"Spirituality/Beliefs (considers God's role in life)\", \"low\", \"While spirituality can play a role in reducing recidivism, it is often less impactful compared to more concrete factors like arrest history or drug use.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
