    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: 22 years old. Young adults are often in a transitional phase, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, but age alone isn't definitive.\n\nRace: White. While race can be a factor in crime statistics, it's important to consider other variables and not rely solely on this.\n\nArrest and conviction history: He has been arrested 5 times and convicted. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions strongly indicate a higher risk of reoffending or further legal issues.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'5\" and 210 lbs. Physical size can sometimes influence risk factors, possibly due to the ability to cause harm or intimidate others, but this alone isn't conclusive.\n\nMarital status: Never married, living alone. Being unmarried and without a support system might contribute to higher risk, as there's less social accountability.\n\nEducation: Has a GED, not enrolled in college. Lower educational attainment can correlate with higher crime rates, though it's just one factor among many.\n\nEmployment: Held 1 job during the year. Steady employment is generally a positive indicator, but having only one job might suggest limited opportunities or stability.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is concerning and can be linked to higher criminal behavior, especially if it's part of a pattern.\n\nMental health: Not felt depressed recently. No reported mental health issues, which could lower risk but doesn't negate other high-risk factors.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area with household size 4. Growing up in an urban environment can have its own challenges, but without more details on family dynamics, it's hard to assess impact.\n\nReligious views: Believes God has a role in his life. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can be protective against crime, so this might slightly reduce risk.\n\nNow, considering all these factors together: multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators here. While some factors like employment and no recent depression might lower the risk somewhat, the arrest history is significant enough to likely outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
