    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, age: he's 21, which is young but not a minor. Typically, younger adults might be more impulsive, but it also depends on other factors.\n\nRace is White; I don't know if that plays into risk assessment in this context, but I should consider any biases related to that, though the model shouldn't factor race into risk scoring ethically.\n\nArrest and conviction history: he's been arrested once and convicted. That definitely increases risk because a criminal record can indicate past behavior that might recur.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'1\" and 155 lbs. I don't think physical stats directly correlate unless they're extremes, so probably neutral here.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Not being married isn't necessarily bad, but living alone could mean less support system, which might contribute to higher risk if he lacks social ties.\n\nEducation: GED and enrolled in college. Education is usually a protective factor because it can provide stability and opportunities, so this might lower the risk.\n\nEmployment: no jobs held during the year. Unemployment can be a red flag as financial stressors may increase the likelihood of criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use: used marijuana in past four years. Marijuana use itself isn't always indicative unless combined with other factors like frequency or other substances, but recent use might still pose some risk.\n\nMental health: not felt depressed recently. Good mental health is protective, so that's a positive sign.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in a household of 3. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more info on the family environment, it's hard to assess.\n\nSpirituality: doesn't see God's role in his life. Spirituality can sometimes act as a protective factor, so lack thereof might slightly increase risk.\n\nPutting this all together: he has a criminal history and unemployment, which are strong indicators of higher risk. His education and no recent depression are positives. The other factors don't add much but might tilt it towards high risk because the negatives are more impactful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
