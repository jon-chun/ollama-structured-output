    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 19-year-old female, which might be a mitigating factor since younger age can sometimes indicate less developed criminal tendencies, but it's not always straightforward.\n\nShe identifies as White. I don't know if race itself is a risk factor here; it probably isn't unless there are underlying issues related to systemic factors, which aren't mentioned.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests and convictions are definitely red flags for potential recidivism. The fact that she's already been convicted suggests she might have a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHer physical stats don't seem relevant here unless there's an issue with size related to crimes, which isn't indicated.\n\nShe's never married and not living alone. Not being married can sometimes correlate with instability, but it's not a direct indicator. Not living alone could mean she has some support system, or it might mean she's in an unstable living situation, which is harder to assess without more info.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can be a factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. However, not being enrolled doesn't necessarily mean she's unstable or likely to offend again.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Having multiple jobs might indicate instability or financial stress, which could be a risk factor if she's struggling to maintain employment. Alternatively, it might show responsibility and adaptability.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use is often linked with criminal behavior, especially if it's recent. The fact that she has a history of drug use could increase her risk of reoffending or engaging in further illegal activities.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health is a significant factor; lack of depression might suggest she's not dealing with severe mental health issues right now, which can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior if left untreated.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in a household of size 5. Large family dynamics could have various implications\u2014maybe indicating a lack of supervision or support, or it could mean a supportive environment. Without more context, it's hard to say, but larger households might correlate with higher risk factors in some cases.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally. This is an interesting one; spirituality can sometimes influence behavior and decision-making. If she feels disconnected from any higher power, it might mean she relies less on external moral frameworks, potentially increasing risk if moral support is lacking.\n\nPutting this all together: She has a criminal history, recent drug use, multiple jobs possibly indicating instability, and some factors that might mitigate (age, education). The arrest and conviction are strong indicators of high risk. Drug use is also significant. On the other hand, she's employed, which can be protective, but having three jobs might indicate underlying issues.\n\nI'm leaning towards \"YES\" for high risk because her criminal history and recent drug use are more impactful than her employment status. However, I'm not entirely certain since she does have some stable factors like a diploma and multiple jobs.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
