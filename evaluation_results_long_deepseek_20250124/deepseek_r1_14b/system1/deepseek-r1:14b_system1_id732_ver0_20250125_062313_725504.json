    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me start by listing each factor and then think about how they might contribute to risk.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old White male. Age-wise, 21 isn't too young, but it's also not middle-aged. I'm not sure if race plays a role here; maybe not directly unless there are other factors.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That's definitely a red flag. A criminal conviction can indicate potential for future offenses, though it depends on the nature of the crime. Without knowing what he was convicted of, it's hard to say, but generally, any conviction increases risk.\n\nHis physical stats: 6'0\" and over 250 lbs. I'm not sure if weight alone is a significant factor, unless it relates to health issues or social factors like discrimination, which might affect behavior.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Being unmarried isn't necessarily a risk indicator on its own, but living alone could mean less social support, which might contribute to higher risk in some contexts.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low education level is often linked with higher crime rates because of limited job opportunities and lower socioeconomic status. This seems like a significant factor pointing towards high risk.\n\nHe's held 1 job during the year. Unstable employment might indicate issues with reliability, but one job doesn't necessarily mean instability yet. It could be that he just started or has consistent work elsewhere.\n\nUsed drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use is a strong indicator of potential criminal behavior, especially if it's recent and involves substances like cocaine which are more associated with crime than marijuana alone.\n\nNo depression reported in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to risk, but since he's not reporting depression now, that might slightly mitigate the risk from other factors.\n\nHe lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4 when young. Family structure and early environment can influence behavior. Living in a larger household might have both positive and negative influences depending on dynamics.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. Lack of religious involvement could mean less social support or accountability, potentially increasing risk factors if religion is a protective factor in his community.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal conviction, low education, recent drug use, and limited job history. These are strong indicators. The lack of a diploma and being unemployed might lead to more criminal activity due to fewer opportunities. His drug use could also correlate with higher recidivism rates. So overall, the risk seems high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
