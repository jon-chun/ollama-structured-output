    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess whether this individual is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might have less stability or more impulsive behavior. But he's just turned 18, so that's a bit of a double-edged sword; he's technically an adult but still potentially influenced by peers.\n\nHe identifies as White. I don't see how race directly affects risk here unless there are societal factors, which might not be relevant in this context.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. Arrests can indicate potential for future issues, but without a conviction, it might suggest the arrest didn't lead to a guilty verdict, maybe due to legal or other reasons. However, an arrest itself could still raise some flags about behavior.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'10\" and 160 lbs. These are average stats; I don't see how this impacts risk assessment unless it's related to physical altercations, but that seems less likely here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone at his age might indicate independence, which is a positive, or could mean lack of support systems. Being unmarried isn't necessarily a negative factor unless it correlates with other issues like isolation.\n\nEnrolled in school currently. Education can be protective against criminal behavior. Being in school suggests he's trying to build a future and has some structure in his life, which generally lowers risk.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is another positive indicator; having a job shows responsibility and provides income, reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities out of necessity or boredom.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not depressed recently. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for crime, so no recent use is good. Not feeling depressed also removes a potential stressor that could lead to impulsive behavior.\n\nGrew up with both biological parents in an urban area with household size 5. Family stability can be protective; living with both parents might reduce the risk of delinquency. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but individual factors often play a bigger role than location.\n\nHe considers God has nothing to do with his personal events. This is more about worldview and spirituality. While some studies suggest religiosity can lower criminal behavior, his lack of belief here doesn't necessarily indicate high risk unless combined with other factors like lack of alternative support systems.\n\nPutting it all together: On the positive side, he's in school, has a job, no recent drug use or depression, and comes from a stable family background. The arrest is a slight concern but not definitive since there was no conviction. His living alone might be neutral; he's young and possibly still establishing independence.\n\nI think these factors lean towards low risk. The only red flag is the prior arrest, but without a conviction and with other positive aspects, it doesn't seem to indicate high risk. So my prediction would be \"NO\" for high risk, maybe with around 30% confidence because while most factors are positive, the arrest could still have some influence.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
