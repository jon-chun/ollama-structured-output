    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old White male. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have less stability but also more potential for change. Race isn't a determining factor on its own, so I'll note that as neutral unless other factors tie into it.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher risk because they show past criminal behavior. The fact that he's been convicted means there's a record which could influence future behavior or access to resources.\n\nHeight and weight don't seem relevant here, so I'll skip those unless they tie into other factors like employment or health, but nothing jumps out.\n\nHe's unmarried and living alone. Living alone might reduce some support systems, potentially increasing risk if he lacks social networks. But being unmarried isn't inherently risky without more context.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Low educational attainment can correlate with higher risk because it limits employment opportunities and may contribute to cycles of poverty and crime.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Having steady work is usually a positive sign, indicating some level of responsibility. However, if he's only working to survive without any long-term goals, it might not be as protective.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant. Substance abuse is a major risk factor because it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to relapse into criminal behavior.\n\nHe felt down in the dumps recently, feeling nothing could cheer him up. Depression or hopelessness can contribute to high-risk behaviors as they might lead to substance use or other forms of self-harm.\n\nGrowing up with his biological father in a household of four. Family dynamics can influence risk factors, but without more details on the family environment (like abuse, neglect, etc.), it's hard to assess. If the family was supportive, that could be protective; if not, it might increase risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor, offering support and structure, but this depends on how he integrates these beliefs into his life.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal history, substance abuse, limited education, and signs of possible depression. These are strong indicators pointing towards high risk. However, having held two jobs shows some stability, which might slightly lower the risk but not enough to outweigh the negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
