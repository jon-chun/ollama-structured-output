    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old male and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. Being young might not be directly linked to high risk unless there are other factors, but I don't see anything obviously concerning about his race here.\n\nHe has been arrested two times and is convicted once. Arrests can indicate past behavior issues, but since he's now enrolled in school and seems stable, maybe this isn't as significant. Convictions do have some weight, though.\n\nHis physical stats are 6 feet 1 inch and 180 lbs. That doesn't seem out of the ordinary; no mention of weight issues or health problems.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a sign of instability if there are underlying issues, but again, not sure without more info.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school \u2013 this suggests he might have good support systems, which could mitigate risk factors.\n\nNo jobs held in the past year. Without income sources, it's possible he might struggle financially or socially, depending on other factors.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use can be a red flag, especially if it's recent and if there are behavioral changes like not feeling depressed. However, it's subjective; maybe he's just in a different mental state now.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month despite drug use. This could mean he's managing his substances differently or has other coping mechanisms.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in a household of six in an urban area. That's quite a family situation, which might indicate stress or neglect if not properly supported. Urban environments can have higher risks but also offer opportunities depending on the individual.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his life \u2013 this could be a positive sign as spirituality often correlates with lower risk behaviors and higher likelihood of seeking help when needed.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a history of arrests, which might suggest past behavior issues, but he's now enrolled in school and seems stable. The drug use is concerning, especially given the timeframe, but his lack of recent depression could indicate he's managing it well or maybe not struggling as much. The family living situation in an urban area with six people could be a risk if not properly supported, but he's young and in school, which might help.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I'm leaning towards a high risk because of the arrest history, substance use without recent depression, and family environment that might present challenges. But his current stability through education and being 18 might reduce it somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
