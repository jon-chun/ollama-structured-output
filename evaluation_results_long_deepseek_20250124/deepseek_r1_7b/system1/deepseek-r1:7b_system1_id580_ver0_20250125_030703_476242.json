    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with a risk assessment analysis for a 22-year-old male. Let me go through each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is White. Generally, race isn't directly tied to criminal behavior in most systems, but it's something to consider if there are any implicit biases in the system.\n\nHe has one arrest and one conviction. That suggests some past involvement with the legal system, which could indicate prior problematic behavior or substance issues.\n\nHis height and weight: 5 feet 2 inches and 120 lbs. This is below average for his age, but does it relate to risk? Maybe not directly unless there's an association with health issues, but no info here about that.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living situation can sometimes be linked to substance use or lack of support, which might increase risk if combined with other factors like drug use history. However, he hasn't used drugs in the past four years, so maybe not a concern here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education level usually correlates with lower recidivism rates, especially higher education or vocational training.\n\nHe's held one job during the year. Employed individuals generally have better support systems and resources to prevent relapse after release.\n\nNo recent drug use for four years\u2014this seems positive as it indicates stability and a clean slate. No depression in the past month suggests he's mentally stable, which is another positive sign.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of five in an urban area. That could imply exposure to certain environments or family dynamics that might influence behavior, but without more info on family issues, it's hard to gauge.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe in God and feels no spiritual support. This could be a risk factor because lack of religious support can affect decision-making and self-control, especially if there are underlying issues related to spirituality influencing his actions.\n\nPutting this all together: One arrest, no active substance use, stable living situation, education, job, and positive mental health. The only negative factors are past belief in God and family size at a young age. However, the lack of active drug use and education suggest he's been proactive about his well-being. The absence of recent drug use and positive mental state likely outweighs any potential negatives here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
