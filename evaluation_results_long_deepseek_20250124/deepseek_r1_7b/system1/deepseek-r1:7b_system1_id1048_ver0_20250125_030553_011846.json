    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for this 18-year-old male. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's 18 and has been arrested six times with previous convictions. That's a significant number of prior offenses, which usually indicates higher risk. \n\nHe identifies as Hispanic, but I don't know if that plays into the risk assessment here. Maybe cultural factors could influence his behavior, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nHis height and weight might not directly relate to his risk unless there are other health indicators, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's never been married and living alone. That might suggest some isolation, which can be a risk factor as he may lack support systems.\n\nCurrently enrolled in school is positive; education often leads to better outcomes and lower recidivism rates.\n\nNo job experience during the year could mean he's not actively seeking opportunities or support, but it also shows he has time for school or personal development.\n\nDrug use (marijuana and cocaine) over the past four years, with some in the last month, is concerning. Drug abuse can impair judgment and increase risk-taking behaviors.\n\nFeeling down most of the time could lead to substance abuse, which ties into his drug use. It might also indicate underlying issues that could affect his ability to make responsible decisions.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four with his biological mother in an urban area suggests he was raised by multiple people, but it's hard to tell how that affects him now. Urban environments can have both positive and negative influences depending on the community.\n\nHis belief that God has nothing to do with his personal life might affect his motivation or support system. If religion is a source of guidance, lack thereof could lead to other coping mechanisms, possibly leading to higher risk behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple prior arrests (6), substance abuse (marijuana and cocaine, recent use), feeling down most of the time, which ties into potential drug use, growing up in a multi-parent household but now living alone without strong support. While some factors are mitigating like being enrolled in school and lack of marriage, others strongly suggest risk.\n\nConsidering these points heavily lean towards high risk, I would say \"YES\" with a confidence level around 85%. He has clear negative risk indicators that outweigh the positive ones mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
