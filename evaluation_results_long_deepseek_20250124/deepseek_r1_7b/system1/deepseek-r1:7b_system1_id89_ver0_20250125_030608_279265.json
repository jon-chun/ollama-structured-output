    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let me go through each factor one by one and analyze them.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. Being young might not directly correlate with high risk unless there are other factors related to age, but his age seems neutral here.\n\nHe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. Two arrests could indicate some past issues, but since it's unclear if he's successfully completed any prior convictions, maybe this factor is low in risk.\n\nHis height and weight: 5 feet 11 inches and 182 lbs. This is slightly above average for his age, which might not directly relate to risk unless there's a connection to physical health or behavior, but nothing jumps out as significant here.\n\nHe's never married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors due to isolation, but without more info on his lifestyle or living situation specifics, it's hard to quantify this factor.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. Education level at this point might suggest some stability, as he's not continuing his education which could indicate lower risk of engaging in risky activities compared to someone with less education.\n\nHe held one job during the year. Employment can be a positive indicator, but only having one job might mean he doesn't have multiple income sources or opportunities for redundancy, possibly increasing risk slightly.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years and no recent depression. These are positive factors that indicate good health and mental well-being, which would decrease risk.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents at a young age in an urban area. A stable home environment from a young age is generally protective against various risks, so this might lower risk.\n\nConsidering God's involvement in his life also suggests a sense of purpose, which could be associated with lower risk behaviors or higher accountability.\n\nPutting all these together: two arrests don't necessarily translate to convictions, living alone isn't enough on its own, but the other factors like stable home environment and positive mental health contribute. The overall risk seems moderate rather than high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
