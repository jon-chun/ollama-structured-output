    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this individual. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male identified as Black. Age-wise, being in his late twenties is relatively young, but considering he has multiple arrest records and convictions, that does raise some red flags.\n\nHe's been arrested six times and convicted once. That alone can be a significant risk factor because repeated arrest tends to correlate with higher recidivism rates.\n\nHis physical characteristics are 5 feet 9 inches and 180 lbs. Weight is sometimes used as an indicator in risk assessment, but it's not always reliable. However, his body weight isn't directly indicating high risk; it's more about how that relates to other factors like past substance use or health issues.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can be a protective factor because he might have fewer social supports, which could contribute to higher risk of negative outcomes if things go wrong mentally or socially.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Not completing high school or not going to college can increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or failing to adapt well into society upon release.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs during the year, which could lead to dependency issues, such as substance abuse, lack of income support, or difficulty finding employment once released from incarceration.\n\nHis drug use history includes marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. Substance abuse is a major risk factor for reoffending. Additionally, he felt extremely down in the dumps during part of the past month, which could indicate low self-esteem or mental health issues that might contribute to criminal behavior again.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in an environment without biological family can have long-term effects on behavior and mental health, potentially increasing the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe believes in God, which is generally seen as a protective factor, but it's subjective and might not directly correlate with risk if he exhibits negative behaviors despite his belief.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple arrests, a history of substance abuse, living alone without support, lack of education, no job, and negative emotional state all point towards high risk. The presence of a GED isn't necessarily a strong protective factor here because it's about not having higher education, which can be linked to more risky situations.\n\nConsidering the number of risk factors pointing towards instability and potential for reoffending, I would lean toward a high risk assessment with a confidence level around 85%. This means there's an 85% chance based on these factors that he presents a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
