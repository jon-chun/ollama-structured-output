    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this risk assessment indicates a high risk for someone who's a 21-year-old Hispanic female. Let me go through each of the risk factors one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted. That seems like a red flag because prior convictions can affect her chances in court or with employers. Then she's only 5'8\" and weighs 160 lbs. I'm not sure how height and weight factor into risk assessment beyond maybe body mass index, but nothing jumps out here.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Single and living alone might relate to her mental health or substance use. She doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Not completing education can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism rates because she might not get the support she needs.\n\nShe has held one job during the year, which is okay but maybe shows some stability? But if her previous attempts were unstable, maybe that's a negative sign too. She used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use can definitely increase risk of reoffending, especially if it's recent.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. If she's been using drugs for a while, sometimes withdrawal or lack of use can make someone feel better, but it could also be a sign of underlying mental health issues that need addressing.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three. That might indicate family structure issues which can influence behavior and risk-taking tendencies.\n\nShe believes God is involved in her life, which generally suggests good moral values, so maybe not the best indicator for high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest, no diploma, living alone, drug use\u2014these factors could point towards a higher risk. I'm leaning towards \"YES\" with confidence around 75% because she has some significant risk factors but also some mitigating points like being young and having some positive traits.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
