    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if these risk factors indicate a high risk for the given individual. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female of White ethnicity. Generally, being younger might not directly correlate with higher recidivism unless there are other factors like substance abuse or unstable living situations.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That might be a positive because at least one arrest doesn't necessarily mean she'll reoffend. However, it's important to consider the nature of the offense and any prior criminal history.\n\nHer height is 5 feet 5 inches and she weighs 135 lbs. No direct information on how this relates to risk factors like weight or BMI in this context.\n\nShe's never been married and living alone\u2014this could be a sign of independence, which might reduce recidivism risk compared to living with someone who might have different responsibilities.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level generally correlates with lower risk as it provides more skills and opportunities for the future.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year\u2014lack of income can increase vulnerability to substance abuse or other negative influences, which might raise risk.\n\nDrug use: She admitted to marijuana and cocaine over the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong indicator of potential risky behavior leading to further issues.\n\nNo depression in the past month\u2014but recent stress from drug use could change that, so it's context-dependent.\n\nLiving with her biological mother since a young age in an urban area\u2014this might suggest she has had consistent support or lack thereof, depending on the environment. Urban areas can have higher crime rates which is a risk factor.\n\nShe believes in God and thinks He affects her life. While spirituality can be protective, it's not directly tied to recidivism unless there are specific fears related to religion causing issues.\n\nPutting this all together: One arrest, low education relative to joblessness, substance abuse, living alone, and potential exposure to urban risks. These factors lean towards high risk but the absence of a conviction might temper that slightly. The drug use is concerning though.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has one non-convicted arrest, which may not be a strong indicator on its own. Her lack of job experience and substance abuse history are significant concerns. Living alone without support could increase vulnerability to further issues.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
