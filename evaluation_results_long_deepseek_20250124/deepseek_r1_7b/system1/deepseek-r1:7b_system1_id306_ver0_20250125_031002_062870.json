    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given risk factors. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old White female who was arrested once but not convicted. That might indicate some prior issues, but since she's not convicted, maybe it's less severe than someone with a full conviction. \n\nShe's 5'5\" and weighs 127 lbs. I'm not sure how height affects risk assessment in this context. Maybe more relevant factors are her living situation or drug use.\n\nShe's living alone, which could be a red flag because living alone can lead to isolation, possibly increasing risk of issues like drug use or domestic violence. But it might also indicate she's independent enough to manage her own safety to some extent.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is currently single, so no spousal support or potential dependency issues from that angle.\n\nShe enrolled in school now, which suggests she's focused on education and maybe less likely to engage in risky behaviors related to substance use. \n\nShe held one job during the year; not sure how relevant that is unless the job was unstable or involved riskier work, but as stated, no specific info there.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. That's concerning because drug use can lead to various behavioral issues and potential health problems. Not feeling depressed might be a protective factor here; sometimes substance use is tied to mental health issues which could complicate things, so maybe not as high risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of five. That's a large family, which can create dependency on parents and social support. The fact that she considers God nothing in her life might indicate some spirituality or lack thereof, which could be related to self-reliance but also potential coping mechanisms.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a minor arrest, no conviction, not married, living alone, educated, one job, drug use (but recent low depression), and a big family background. The drug use is concerning, but since she's recently not felt depressed, maybe that mitigates some risk. Her living situation in a large household might offer support, which could reduce risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards NO as the prediction because her recent lack of depression might suggest better mental health, though there are still factors like drug use and prior arrest to consider.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
