    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this case step by step. The individual is a 21-year-old male from White background with several risk factors. I'll go through each factor one by one to assess their impact on rearrest recidivism.\n\nFirst, he has two prior arrests and convictions. Each arrest significantly increases the chances of recidivism because it's a clear indicator of past behavior issues. So this is definitely a high weight factor.\n\nHis weight is between 150-174 lbs, which might suggest some underlying health issues or perhaps substance use disorder. This could be a medium to high risk factor depending on other factors like living conditions and current health status.\n\nHe's never married and living alone adds to the risk of isolation and potential drug misuse. That's another high weight factor because living in a single can cut off social support, which is crucial for recovery.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED certificate means he might have struggled with education, which could contribute to substance abuse and unstable situations. This is also a medium-high risk factor since lack of education often correlates with higher recidivism rates.\n\nNot being enrolled in college further supports the previous point about educational barriers. It's another medium-high factor because academic support can aid in finding better opportunities or help.\n\nHe's held two jobs, which might indicate some work experience but could also mean limited resources if he's struggling to manage substance use while employed. This is a low weight factor as having employment can sometimes lead to better life choices, but it depends on the context of substance abuse and support availability.\n\nUsing marijuana and cocaine regularly is a strong indicator of drug dependence. Substance abuse has been linked to higher rates of recidivism because it disrupts daily life and increases crime-related activities. This is definitely a high weight factor.\n\nFeeling down for most of the month suggests ongoing emotional distress, which can contribute to substance use as a coping mechanism. Emotional instability often leads to substance abuse and other risky behaviors, making this another high risk factor.\n\n living with his biological dad in a household of three in an urban area might provide some support but could also mean limited supervision or neglect if there are issues at home. Urban environments can sometimes offer more opportunities for negative influences, so this is a medium-high factor.\n\nConsidering God as part of his personal growth indicates he's attempting to address personal issues, which might be a positive sign. However, it also shows that he's struggling with internal conflicts, making him less likely to change behavior effectively. This could slightly lower the risk but still should be considered medium.\n\nPutting it all together: High prior arrests, substance use, living alone, lack of education, and emotional distress are strong indicators pointing towards a high risk of recidivism. The presence of two prior convictions alone would lean towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"The individual has been arrested twice, which significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest as past behavior can predict future criminal activity.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"medium\", \"His weight is between 150 and 174 lbs, potentially indicating underlying health issues or substance use, contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"high\", \"Living alone increases isolation, which can worsen substance use and contribute to higher rearrest rates.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Not having a high school diploma or GED certificate may correlate with higher substance abuse rates and recidivism.\"),\n    (\"not_enrolled_in_college\", \"medium\", \"Not being enrolled in college could limit opportunities for support and betterment, increasing risk.\"),\n    (\"jobs_held\", \"low\", \"Holding two jobs might provide some stability but does not directly correlate with lower recidivism without addressing substance use issues.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Regular use of marijuana and cocaine is a significant indicator of potential substance dependence leading to higher rearrest risk.\"),\n    (\"emotional_distress\", \"high\", \"Feeling down for most of the month suggests ongoing emotional distress, which can be a coping mechanism for substance abuse and increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Living with his biological dad in a household of three may provide some support but could also indicate limited supervision if issues exist within the home\"),\n    (\"god\", \"low\", \"Considering God as part of personal growth shows an attempt at self-improvement, which might suggest potential for change but also indicates internal conflict.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
