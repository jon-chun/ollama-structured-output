    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a 22-year-old Black male based on his risk factors. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has been arrested 9 times with 3 convictions. That's a high number of prior offenses, which definitely increases the risk. So this should be a high weight factor because it's strongly associated with recidivism.\n\nHe's 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 190 lbs. The initial examples didn't cover weight or height as factors, but body weight can sometimes indicate other issues, so maybe medium weight here.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014being single might have lower risk compared to those in relationships, but since he's not married, it's a bit of an exception. Maybe low to medium weight depending on context.\n\nHaving a GED and not enrolled in college: Not completing high school can be a negative factor, so maybe medium weight because some examples with lower education had higher outcomes, but others might vary.\n\nHe held only 1 job during the year. Unemployment for a while is a risk, so medium weight.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) and feeling down in the month: Drug use, especially marijuana, which isn't too harsh, can be a factor, so medium. Emotional state also matters; being down might correlate with substance issues or mental health problems affecting recidivism rates.\n\nLiving with his biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area. Urban areas often have higher crime rates and different dynamics that could affect outcomes, maybe high weight because it's specific to his living situation which is not common in the examples provided.\n\nBelieves God influences his life\u2014this is a positive factor as spirituality can help, so low weight here.\n\nPutting all together: High prior convictions, medium education, unemployment, moderate drug use, and unique living situation. The overall risk seems higher but not extremely high because of some mitigating factors like spiritual belief. So maybe around 60-70% confidence leaning towards NO.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"He has a significant number of prior arrests (9) with convictions, which strongly correlates with higher recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\" employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Employment status shows he was unemployed for part of the year, which may indicate potential challenges affecting his ability to reintegrate successfully.\"),\n    (\"marital_status_living_alone\", \"low\", \"Living alone and never married might suggest personal circumstances that could influence his stability but not necessarily directly correlate with higher risk compared to other factors.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Having a GED without continuing education may present some challenges, though it varies based on individual circumstances and support systems.\"),\n    (\"job held\", \"low\", \"He has only held one job during the year, which might indicate temporary unemployment or lack of consistent work history, contributing to potential instability.\"),\n    (\"drug Use (marijuana)\", \"medium\", \"Drug use (specifically marijuana) can be a risk factor for substance abuse issues that may affect recidivism rates.
