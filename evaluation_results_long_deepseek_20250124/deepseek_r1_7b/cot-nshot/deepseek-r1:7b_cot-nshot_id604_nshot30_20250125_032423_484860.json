    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who's White, arrested once but not convicted. His weight is 202 lbs, which seems within a normal range. He's never married and living alone. That might be a red flag because living with others can sometimes provide support and reduce stress, but since he's alone, maybe that contributes to higher recidivism.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Completing high school is often seen as a positive step towards better opportunities, so not having a diploma or attending college might indicate lower educational aspirations or resources, which could increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nHe's held 2 jobs during the year. Having work experience can be beneficial as it shows responsibility and ability to manage tasks. So, two jobs aren't a bad sign by themselves but maybe they're not very stable or high-paying, so that might not help much in the long run.\n\nDrugs: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor for recidivism because it can impair judgment, decision-making, and social interactions. It also puts him at risk of becoming involved in further illegal activities or substance abuse problems.\n\nFeeling down for some time indicates emotional distress. Emotional challenges can affect an individual's ability to cope with stressors, leading to unstable behavior, which is a precursor to recidivism.\n\nLiving alone since he was young: He mentions living with both biological parents at age 10 in a household of size 10, but now he's not with them and living alone. Being raised in a larger household might have different dynamics, but the fact that he's no longer living with his family could mean less supervision or emotional support, which can contribute to higher recidivism rates.\n\nHe believes in God, which is considered a positive factor as it shows internal motivation towards personal values rather than external pressure. This could actually lower the risk compared to someone who lacks such belief.\n\nNow, looking at the examples provided earlier, similar cases with multiple drug offenses or less support from family often ended up with a 'YES' outcome for rearrest recidivism. Conversely, people with higher education and stable living situations tend to have 'NO' outcomes.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the presence of drug use (high risk) and emotional distress adds significant weight towards predicting a positive outcome for rearrest. However, the lack of a GED and college enrollment might slightly lower the confidence. Living alone could also add another layer, but since he's not in a family household anymore, it's less of an issue compared to when he was younger.\n\nOverall, while there are some mitigating factors like employment history and belief in God, the main risk factors here\u2014drug use and emotional distress\u2014are strong indicators pointing towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. So I'm leaning towards 'YES' with high confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor for the 22-year-old male:\n\n- **Drug Use**: High (past four years, potential for further substance abuse)\n- **Emotional Distress**: High (feeling down and affecting behavior)\n- **Living Alone**: Medium (no longer with parents, but no indication of living issues now)\n- **Education**: Medium (GED but not in college; may limit future opportunities)\n- **Employment**: Low to Medium (two jobs, potential for stability)\n\nConsidering these factors heavily influence the recidivism rate:\n\n**Prediction**: YES  \n**Confidence**: 85\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Ages 22\", \"Medium\", \"His age might indicate a higher risk of making impulsive decisions.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use (Marijuana)\", \"High\", \"Past four years and current distress indicate possible relapse.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"High\", \"F frequent mood swings could lead to more unstable behavior.\"),\n    (\"Living Alone\", \"Medium\", \"No longer with parents, but no evidence of living issues.\"),\n    (\"GED and College\", \"Medium\", \"May limit future opportunities but not directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Employment (2 jobs)\", \"Low\", \"Stable but perhaps not contributing positively to risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
