    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given case for recidivism using the provided risk factors. The person is a 22-year-old female mixed race who hasn't been convicted despite one arrest. She's married living with her spouse, no high school diploma, not enrolled in college, no job experience, no drug use, and sometimes feels down.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each example to see how the risk factors correlate with rearrest outcomes. For instance, in Example 7, someone similar to this case (Black female, single, no job, felt low mood) had a NO outcome. But in Example 18, a White male with multiple arrests and drug use had a YES.\n\nLooking at her factors:\n\nAge: 22 is relatively young, which might be associated with higher recidivism but she's in a stable household.\nMarital status: Married living with spouse - this usually indicates stability; lower risk of rearrest compared to single status. But in Example 18, the married male had a YES outcome despite being Black and having multiple arrests. Hmm.\n\nEducation: No diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. In many examples without education had higher recidivism rates when compared to those with diplomas. This factor would likely increase her risk.\n\nEmployment: She held no jobs during the year. Unemployment is a known predictor of recidivism; she might be more likely to reoffend within three years.\n\nMood: Sometimes feels down, which could indicate stress or other underlying issues that may contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHousehold size and living conditions: She's in a household of 4, but it was in a rural area. In Example 27, someone with similar factors had NO outcome. However, in Example 26, another case with similar factors had a YES. It's a mixed signal but maybe the environment doesn't directly correlate.\n\nGod involvement: She believes nothing happens without God, which might indicate strong personal motivation against crime, reducing recidivism risk.\n\nPutting it all together: Despite being married and in a household of 4, her lack of education, unemployment, no job experience, and sometimes feeling down could raise her risk. Her positive religious belief might mitigate some factors but not enough to offset the others.\n\nSo, considering these points, she's on the higher risk side for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"medium\", \"Her age of 22 is relatively young, which may be associated with higher recidivism rates compared to older individuals.
