    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for a specific case based on given risk factors. Let me start by breaking down each factor and assigning a weight to them.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male who has been arrested 3 times but hasn't been convicted yet. Having multiple arrests without a conviction can be a strong indicator of higher recidivism because it shows instability or perhaps not meeting court conditions after previous convictions.\n\nHe's 6 feet 1 inch tall. I don't know if height is a standard risk factor, but maybe in this context, it doesn't play a significant role unless there are specific studies suggesting otherwise.\n\nNext, he's never been married and is living alone. Living situation can influence recidivism; living alone might lead to feelings of isolation which could contribute to substance use or other issues, so that's a medium weight factor pointing towards higher risk.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a known predictor of recidivism; lack of education often correlates with lower income and more opportunities for bad choices, so this should be a high-weight factor indicating he's at higher risk.\n\nHe's held only 1 job during the year. Joblessness can lead to dependency on substances or other means of survival, which might increase the chance of recidivism. This is another high-weight factor pointing towards yes.\n\nHe uses marijuana in the past four years and feels down a lot. Drug use, especially with substances that can affect mental health like marijuana, can exacerbate mood issues. Feeling \"down\" could indicate deeper emotional struggles, which are risk factors for substance abuse and recidivism. This is definitely a high-weight factor.\n\nLiving with a household of size 8 at a young age. Large households might provide more support, but if the person was raised in such an environment without strong ties or stability, it could be problematic. However, since he's currently living alone, maybe this isn't as significant now, so perhaps medium weight.\n\nConsidering that God is involved with his personal events, which might suggest a sense of hope or purpose, possibly reducing recidivism risk slightly. This factor might have a low to medium weight but probably not enough to counterbalance the other high-risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests (conviction pending), no education, unemployment, drug use, and living issues. These are strong indicators pointing towards a high likelihood of rearrest. So my prediction is \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each risk factor, I've assigned weights indicating their influence on the recidivism outcome.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Arrests without Conviction\", \"high\", \"Having multiple arrests but no prior convictions indicates potential instability and possible failure to meet court conditions, significantly increasing the risk of rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Lack of job experience or employment during the past year could contribute to substance use or other issues that may lead to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests lower income potential and increased risk of bad choices, significantly contributing to recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana and feeling down a significant portion of the time can lead to deeper emotional struggles, increasing the likelihood of substance abuse and rearrest.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no family support could lead to feelings of isolation, potentially contributing to substance use or other negative behaviors but not as directly as other factors\"),\n    (\"Household Size at Age 19\", \"low\", \"Large household size may have provided some level of support initially, though it doesn't necessarily predict current behavior or risk of recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
