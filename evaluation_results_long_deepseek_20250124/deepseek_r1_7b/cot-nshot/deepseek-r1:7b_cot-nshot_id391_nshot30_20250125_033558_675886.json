    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this case using the given risk factors and determine the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome. Let me start by going through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age: The person is 19 years old. From the examples, older individuals seem to have lower recidivism rates, so maybe that's a low risk factor.\n\nNext, number of prior arrests and convictions: He has been arrested once and convicted. That seems moderate; one conviction isn't too bad but might still be a medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5 feet 7 inches and 160 lbs. In the examples, similar demographics don't show a clear trend, so maybe this is low.\n\nMarital status: Never married living alone. Being single can have both positive (more freedom) and negative (higher stress) impacts. But in the context of recidivism, it's probably medium risk.\n\nEducation level: High school diploma not enrolled. Education usually helps reduce recidivism, so that might be a low or medium depending on other factors.\n\nNumber of jobs held: He has 1 job during the year. Holding a job is positive for employment stability, which can reduce recidivism, so maybe low.\n\nDrug use: He used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use is a significant risk factor as it increases the likelihood of substance abuse issues leading to further problems. Since he's using marijuana and feels down most of the time, this could be high risk.\n\nHousehold size at young age: Lived with his biological mother in a household of 5, rural area. Larger households can sometimes correlate with more stress or less stability, so maybe medium.\n\nGod's role: He says God has nothing to do with his life. This is important because religious involvement is often linked to lower recidivism rates due to moral support and community ties. If he doesn't see a connection, that could increase risk, so high.\n\nPutting it all together: The factors include one conviction (medium), low education (low), job held (low), no drug use except marijuana (high), living in a larger household (medium), and no religious involvement (high). The high factors from drug use and lack of God's role might tip the risk towards higher. However, considering he's 19, which is young, maybe mitigates it slightly.\n\nLooking at similar cases: Example 2 had one arrest, lived alone, used marijuana, and had a high outcome. Another example with more factors also resulted in YES. So perhaps this case leans towards YES.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The person is 19 years old, which might indicate lower recidivism risk compared to older individuals who often have more life experience and potential for relapse.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and conviction can increase the risk of recidivism but may not be as significant in a young individual with positive factors like education and employment.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"low\", \"The person is 5 feet 7 inches and weighs 160 lbs.
