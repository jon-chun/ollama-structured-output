    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this 18-year-old female will be rearrested within three years. Let's go through each risk factor one by one.\n\nFirst, her age is 18. Younger individuals might have lower recidivism rates because they're still developing, but it also depends on other factors like prior convictions and living situation.\n\nShe's Black, which historically has some higher arrest rates due to systemic issues, so that's a medium risk factor.\n\nShe was arrested once but not convicted. A single arrest without conviction can be a red flag, especially if she's never served time before.\n\nHer weight is 120 lbs at 5'7\". Underweight can sometimes indicate malnutrition or being in a high-risk environment, which might contribute to substance abuse issues.\n\nShe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living with family usually reduces stressors, but living alone can lead to isolation and potential substance use problems.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Education is a strong predictor of lower recidivism when completed, so this might be a medium risk because she's not continuing her education.\n\nShe held three jobs during the year. Having stable employment is usually positive for reducing recidivism, so maybe low risk here.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and felt down recently. Substance abuse can definitely increase recidivism rates, especially if it leads to more risky behavior or self-doubt.\n\nLiving with both parents in a household of four in an urban area might mean she's in a stimulating environment, but urban areas can have higher stressors too, which could indirectly affect her mental health.\n\nShe believes in God. This is actually protective against recidivism because spirituality often correlates with better mental health and lower substance use.\n\nPutting it all together: Medium risk factors include race, prior arrest without conviction, living situation, education, employment, and recent drug use. High risk isn't as present here except perhaps for the isolation from family due to living alone. The positive factor is her spiritual belief. So overall, maybe a 60% confidence of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"Her age is 18, which is relatively young and typically associated with lower recidivism rates due to developmental factors.\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Being Black may have historical systemic advantages that reduce recidivism risk compared to other groups but are still a consideration.\"),\n    (\"Prior Arrests\", \"low\", \"She has one prior arrest without a conviction, which is a minor issue and not a significant risk factor in itself.\"),\n    (\"Weight\", \"low\", \"Her weight is 120 lbs at 5'7'', indicating possible malnutrition or living in a high-risk environment, which could contribute to substance abuse issues but isn't directly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Marital Status and Living Arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without family support can lead to isolation and potential substance use problems, increasing risk slightly.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"low\", \"She has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college; education completion is typically associated with lower recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"high\", \"Holding three jobs during the year suggests stable employment, which is usually positive for reducing recidivism.
