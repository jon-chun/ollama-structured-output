    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query about a risk assessment for a 20-year-old female named Maria. The goal is to determine her likelihood of rearrest within three years using the given factors. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst off, her age and race: she's 20 and Black. Generally, younger individuals have higher recidivism rates because they're more likely to drop out of school or get involved in more risky behavior as they age. Race can also play a role due to systemic issues, so that adds some weight.\n\nNext, her criminal history: one arrest but not convicted. An arrest without a conviction is still significant because it might indicate past problematic behavior or lack of commitment once she was released. It's important even if she's not convicted; it could signal trust issues with law enforcement.\n\nHer physical characteristics are average height and weight (5'2\"/120 lbs). This isn't a major factor, but it doesn't raise any red flags either.\n\nMarital status: she's never married and living alone. Living alone can lead to feelings of loneliness, which might contribute to substance abuse or other unstable behaviors that could increase recidivism risk.\n\nEducation level: high school diploma not enrolled in college. She has the basic education but isn't continuing her studies, which might indicate a lack of motivation or support for further education and training.\n\nEmployment: she's held two jobs in the past year. Having some work experience is positive as it shows responsibility and ability to manage tasks. However, only two jobs over a year might not be enough if she needs more stable employment or has barriers to full-time work.\n\nDrug use: no drugs in the past four years. That's a strong negative factor because drug abuse significantly increases the risk of criminal behavior due to impaired judgment and legal consequences.\n\nMental health: felt down for most of last month but nothing too serious. While some stress is normal, chronic feelings of low mood could indicate underlying issues that aren't addressed, potentially leading to substance abuse or other risky behaviors.\n\nUpbringing: lived with her biological dad in a household of four in an urban area at a young age. Growing up in such an environment can be protective against some forms of abuse but might also expose her to certain pressures or issues if not properly supported.\n\nReligious belief: she believes God has something to do with her personal events. Religious factors can influence behavior, and while it's hard to quantify the exact impact, it's worth considering as a mitigating factor.\n\nNow, putting it all together. The high school diploma without college might mean she lacks formal skills that could help in re-entering society successfully. Her living situation isn't ideal but doesn't directly correlate with crime. She hasn't used drugs recently, which is good. However, her past arrest and the potential mental health issues from her upbringing are significant. The fact that she's never married might place extra stress on any future relationships.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I think there's a moderate risk of recidivism in three years. The presence of an arrest without a conviction, potential mental health issues, and being young all contribute to a medium relative weight. Her positive drug use history is a strong mitigator but the other factors aren't negligible enough to push it down to low.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age: Being 20 years old may increase recidivism risk as individuals often continue to engage in risky behavior or drop out of school before reaching maturity.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Criminal History: An arrest without a conviction can indicate potential past behavior issues and may reflect trust issues with law enforcement, which could influence future risk.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Marital Status: Living alone at 20 years old may lead to feelings of loneliness or instability, which could potentially contribute to substance abuse or other unstable behaviors that increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Education Level: A high school diploma without college enrollment may indicate a lack of formal education and training opportunities, which could impact future employability and responsibility in society.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment: Holding two jobs over the past year indicates some work experience but may not be sufficient to ensure long-term stability or increased risk of recidivism if barriers exist to full-time employment.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Drug Use: Not using drugs in the past four years and recent use indicate a positive trend, which is a strong mitigating factor against recidivism.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Mental Health: Feeling down for most of the past month may suggest potential mental health issues that could lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors if not properly addressed.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Upbringing: Growing up in a household of four with a biological father in an urban area at a young age may provide some protective factors but could also expose her to certain pressures or environments conducive to criminal behavior if not properly supported.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religion: Believing God has something to do with her personal events may influence her behavior, but this factor is less directly correlated with recidivism compared to other factors like drug use or mental health issues.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
