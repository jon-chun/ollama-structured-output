    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this case to assess the risk of rearrest for a 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is 21, which isn't too old yet, but he has a history that might be concerning. He's only held one job in the past year, so maybe he struggles with steady employment or perhaps lost it for some reason. But I don't see a high risk from just being young here.\n\nHe uses marijuana up to four times a year, which could indicate drug use issues. But since it's not a hard substance like crack or cocaine, maybe the impact isn't as severe. Plus, he hasn't felt depressed recently, so maybe the drugs aren't causing significant issues.\n\nLiving alone might be contributing to some stressors. He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which could limit opportunities and might make him less likely to get involved in trouble again if he faces unemployment or lack of skills.\n\nHe was living with his biological mother in a household size of six when he was young in a rural area. That's a tough spot because small households can be isolating and maybe he experienced abuse or neglect, which could have long-term effects on his behavior or self-esteem.\n\nHis belief in God might offer some support, but it doesn't directly relate to criminal behavior unless it affects his decision-making. He feels that God has something to do with his personal events, so maybe he's more likely to seek help if needed, reducing recidivism risk.\n\nPutting all these together: His past living situation and drug use are concerning factors, especially since he was in a large household without a stable environment. The lack of education might make him less employable or prone to situations that could lead to further issues.\n\nI think the high risk factors here are his living arrangement at 16 (biological mother in a household of six) and perhaps his drug use, even if it's not severe. So I'd assign medium to living with his mother and low to other factors like employment or education. The prediction would lean towards high risk because of the challenging past circumstances.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"low\", \"The individual is 21 years old, which is relatively young, indicating potential for future development and reduced recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Employment History\", \"low\", \"He has held only one job during the past year, suggesting some employability issues but not necessarily a high risk of reoffending.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 1 job during the year.
