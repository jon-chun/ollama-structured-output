    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of rearrest for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White. I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there's some systemic bias, but with only one arrest and not convicted, maybe it's less significant.\n\nHe's 6 feet 4 inches, which might affect his ability to find employment or live independently, possibly increasing the risk of dependency issues.\n\nNever married and living alone. Single status can sometimes be a red flag for various reasons, like lack of support network.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Education is a big factor; lack of it might mean he's less likely to get better job opportunities, increasing recidivism risk.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years. Substance use can impair judgment and decision-making, which could lead to more impulsive behavior.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month. If he's not depressed, maybe he doesn't have other mental health issues that might affect his ability to reintegrate after a new situation.\n\nAt a young age, lived with biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. Growing up in such an environment can sometimes lead to social or emotional challenges, potentially affecting his behavior later on.\n\nBelieves God is involved in his life. That's more of a positive factor usually, but I'm not sure how that affects risk here.\n\nSo putting it all together: one arrest, not convicted; maybe medium risk because factors like lack of education and substance use can contribute. But the other factors don't seem to add much. So my prediction is he has a low risk.\n</think>\n\nThe individual's background shows minimal risk factors contributing to recidivism. Despite some challenges like past drug use, his age indicates he's likely to move on from such behaviors.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Age: 22 years old typically indicates a young and potentially responsible individual who may not repeat previous actions.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college - lower education often correlates with higher recidivism risk but may also indicate potential for change with support.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Drug use in the past four years - while this can contribute to risky behavior, he has not felt depressed recently, suggesting possible self-regulation or personal growth.'),\n    (\"family_environment\", \"low\", \"Living with a biological mother in a household of four in a rural area at a young age - while this could present challenges, it does not necessarily indicate a high risk of recidivism without further context about potential trauma or neglect.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Not married and currently not living alone - single status can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism risk due to isolation but may also offer opportunities for new beginnings.\"),\n    (\"physical_dimensions\", \"medium\", \"6 feet 4 inches tall, weighs 157 lbs - while this could indicate dependency issues or health risks, it does not directly correlate with recidivism without additional context about health status or living conditions.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
