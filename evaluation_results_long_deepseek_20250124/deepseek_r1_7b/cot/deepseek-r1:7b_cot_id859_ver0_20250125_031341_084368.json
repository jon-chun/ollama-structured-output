    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with this risk assessment query for a 22-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22, which is relatively young but she's already been arrested once. That's concerning because younger individuals might have fewer life experiences and could be more prone to similar issues again. So that points towards a high risk.\n\nHer race is White, which doesn't directly indicate anything in this context, so I'll note that as low impact here.\n\nShe has one prior conviction, but since it was her first offense, the recidivism rate might actually decrease slightly because she's already learned from it. But given the other factors, she might still be at a medium risk.\n\nMarital status: She's married and living with her spouse. Stable relationships often lead to better support systems post-prison, which can help reduce recidivism. So this factor lowers her risk to low.\n\nEducation-wise, she lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Without formal education, especially if it's from a reliable source like high school, she might have fewer opportunities and could be less likely to secure employment post-release, increasing risk to medium.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Having at least some work experience is positive as it can provide income stability. However, with limited time in employment and no higher education, this might still present a moderate risk factor.\n\nHer drug use history: She hasn't used drugs in four years. That's a strong positive indicator of sobriety, which correlates with lower recidivism rates. So this lowers her risk to low.\n\nMental health: She hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of recent mental health issues is another positive sign that could influence lower recidivism risk.\n\nHer early life circumstances are quite concerning. At a young age, she lived in a household of six siblings in a rural area. That's a high risk factor because living with multiple siblings can lead to neglect, abuse, or unstable family environments. This puts her at a high risk overall due to the harsh living conditions and potential neglect.\n\nHer religious belief is that God has something to do with her personal life. While this doesn't directly relate to recidivism, it's worth noting as it might indicate seeking support from a higher power, which could aid in recovery efforts.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior conviction (medium), age (high risk due to being young despite one offense), education and employment (moderate negative), living conditions (high positive). The living situation seems to heavily influence her risk the most. So my prediction is that she has a high risk of rearrest within three years, but I'm not entirely confident because some factors like education are still negative.\n\nTherefore, I'll assign each factor accordingly and conclude with a high risk assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"The individual is 22 years old, which may increase the likelihood of rearrest due to being relatively young despite prior convictions.\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Her race (White) does not directly indicate a higher or lower risk in this context.\"),\n    (\"prior_conviction\", \"medium\", \"She has one prior conviction, but it is her first offense, which may slightly decrease the risk compared to individuals with multiple prior offenses.\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"She is married and living with her spouse, which indicates a stable living situation that could reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"She does not have a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which may limit opportunities for success post-release and increase the risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"She has held one job during the past year, which could provide some stability but may also indicate limited support systems post-release.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"She has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator of sobriety and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"She has not felt depressed over the past month, which could indicate good mental health and lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"early_life_circumstances\", \"high\", \"At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 6 in a rural area, which is a high-risk factor due to potential neglect or abuse in such an environment.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.
