He's white, has a criminal history with one arrest and one conviction, is 5'7\" and 160 lbs, living alone, never married. His education level is high school diploma without college enrollment. He's worked only one job in the past year.\n\nHe uses marijuana in the past four years but feels down most of the time now, which might indicate some mental health issues or low mood affecting his behavior. His background is from a household of five kids in a rural area at a young age. He doesn't believe in God affecting his personal life, so maybe he's more self-determined.\n\nLooking at the risk factors: criminal history (medium), substance use (low-medium). His living situation could be a medium factor because growing up in a large family might have its challenges but not directly linked to recidivism. Education level is low, which can increase risk as education is a mitigating factor. Single-parent household or living alone adds some risk factors like financial stress.\n\nHis mood and self-perception don't directly tie into recidivism unless there's underlying issues he's handling. So, considering all these, I think the overall risk might be medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal history\", \"medium\", \"The individual has a criminal history with one prior arrest and one conviction, which is a significant factor in predicting recidivism as individuals with such a history are more likely to reoffend.\"),\n    (\"substance use\", \"low-medium\", \"The individual has used marijuana in the past four years.
