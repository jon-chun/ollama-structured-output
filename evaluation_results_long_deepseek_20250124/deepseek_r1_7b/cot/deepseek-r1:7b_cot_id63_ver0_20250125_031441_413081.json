    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this query from a user who wants me to act as a criminal justice risk assessment expert. They provided detailed information about a 19-year-old female with various risk factors and asked for a relative weight assignment followed by a prediction and confidence level.\n\nFirst, I need to parse all the details given. She's 19, Hispanic, has one arrest without a conviction, and is quite young, which might be a red flag because younger individuals often don't complete their sentences or reintegrate into society well. Her demographics are non-Hispanic in terms of marriage status and living situation, but that doesn't immediately stand out as a risk factor.\n\nHer education level is a big one\u2014she lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. Educational barriers can lead to poor job prospects and higher chances of involvement in the criminal justice system again. Not working at all during the year also points towards potential lack of motivation or support systems.\n\nThe drug use history is clean, but the emotional state\u2014she felt down for much of the past month without any cheers\u2014is concerning. Emotional instability can affect relationships, job performance, and decision-making, all of which might contribute to recidivism.\n\nLiving with both parents at a young age in an urban area suggests she was raised in a close, possibly neglectful environment, especially considering it was size 9 household. That could indicate family dysfunction or abuse, which are strong indicators of potential issues later on.\n\nHer religious belief is noted, but I don't see how that directly affects risk unless she's involved in religion-related activities, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe that factor is low.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: age (19), non-convicted arrest, education and employment gaps, emotional instability, and family background. These seem to lean towards a higher risk of recidivism. I'm thinking the prediction would be \"YES,\" with high confidence because each factor independently increases the likelihood. \n\nI need to structure this into JSON format as specified, assigning each factor a weight based on its impact. The factors that are most impactful\u2014age, education, employment, family environment, and emotional state\u2014are all high risk. So I'll assign them high weights accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age (19 years old)\", \"high\", \"Young individuals often lack life experience and may not complete their sentences or reintegrate into society properly.\"),\n    (\"Arrest Record (1 time, no conviction)\", \"high\", \"A non-convicted arrest can indicate potential for future involvement in the criminal justice system if released on bail or parole.\"),\n    (\"Education Level (No HS diploma/GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education and not attending college may lead to poor job prospects and increased risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status (No jobs during the year)\", \"medium\", \"Continuously being unemployed can contribute to economic instability and stress, potentially leading to further criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"Emotional State (Felt down for much of the past month)\", \"high\", \"Persistent emotional instability may affect relationships, job performance, or decision-making, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Family History (Born in a household of size 9 with both biological parents)\", \"high\", \"Small family households and living with multiple relatives at a young age can indicate potential family dysfunction or neglect.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History (Never used drugs in past four years)\", \"low\", \"No recent drug use is not a strong risk factor for substance abuse or related crimes.\"),\n    (\"Religious Belief (Believes in God but no involvement mentioned)\", \"low\", \"Religious belief without active involvement does not directly correlate with recidivism risk unless supported by religious activity or influence.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 2 inches and weighs between 100 and 124 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
