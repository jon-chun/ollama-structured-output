    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk of this 21-year-old female having rearrest within three years. Let me break down her profile step by step.\n\nFirst, she has a criminal history with two prior arrests and a conviction. That's a solid red flag because recidivism is often linked to past offenses. So that's probably high risk right there.\n\nShe's 5'2\" and 120 lbs. Weight can sometimes be a factor in recidivism, but without knowing her BMI or other health factors, it's hard to say. But she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't attending college. That lack of education could mean she might not have the skills needed for stable employment, which is another high risk indicator.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the past year. Joblessness can lead to substance abuse, lack of support system, and higher chances of reoffending. So that's definitely a medium-high risk factor.\n\nHer drug use history from the past four years, specifically marijuana, could be problematic. Drug abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates as it can impair judgment and decision-making. But since she hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe her motivation is different now? I'm not sure how that plays into it, but drug use itself is a risk factor.\n\nLiving with her spouse in a rural household at a young age might mean she didn't have the same level of support or resources as someone living in an urban setting. That could be a medium-low risk because rural areas sometimes have different dynamics, but it's still something to consider.\n\nShe mentions considering God's influence on her life, which is a positive factor often associated with personal accountability and moral compass. That could lower the risk compared to someone who doesn't have such strong spiritual support.\n\nPutting all these together: Prior criminal history (high), lack of education (high), unemployment (medium-high), drug use (high). The living situation and her spirituality are mitigating factors but not enough to offset the high risks from her past behavior.\n\nSo, considering everything, I think there's a high likelihood she'll be rearrested. Her prior convictions, lack of education, and unemployment are strong indicators pointing towards a high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Arrests and Convictions\", \"high\", \"Individual has a history of two arrests and one conviction, which is strongly associated with recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Education Level and College Attainment\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED, combined with not attending college, suggests potential for poor employability and support network, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"Unemployment During Past Year\", \"medium-high\", \"No job held during the past year may indicate lack of income stability and social support, contributing to higher risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Use of marijuana in the past four years could impair decision-making and increase the likelihood of criminal behavior, though recent feelings of depression may suggest current motivation is different.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation and Spirituality\", \"low\", \"Living with a spouse in a rural area at a young age, coupled with consideration of God's influence on her life, indicates stronger support systems which may mitigate risk factors related to instability or lack of resources.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
