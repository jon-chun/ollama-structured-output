Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested six times and convicted once before. That's a significant number of prior convictions. Each prior offense can increase the chance of reoffending because they might have underlying issues or higher risk factors. So that's high risk right there.\n\nHe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs between 150-174 lbs, which is within a normal range for his age. Body weight alone doesn't predict much, but combined with other factors like living situation could influence it.\n\nHe's never married and living alone. Living in a stable home environment can help prevent issues, so being single might be a red flag for other problems he might have that could lead to higher risk.\n\nHe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Education is often linked to better job opportunities and lower crime rates. Not having this could put him at higher risk of re-entering the criminal system after being released.\n\nHe's held only one job during the year, which might mean he's struggling financially or hasn't found stable employment yet. Unemployment can lead to substance abuse, lack of direction, etc., all linked to recidivism.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically cocaine. Drug use is a direct risk factor for reoffending because it can impair judgment, increase impulsivity, and lead to more criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Depression can be a sign of deeper issues or lack of motivation, which could contribute to substance abuse or other crimes once released.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of four in a rural area. A larger household might indicate more stress or less supervision, especially in a rural setting where he might have fewer opportunities and support systems.\n\nHe believes in God but thinks it affects his personal life. While belief in religion can influence behavior, it's not directly tied to criminal risk unless there are specific issues related to faith, which isn't indicated here.\n\nPutting all these together: multiple prior offenses, low education, unemployed, living alone, drug use, and a rural upbringing all contribute significantly to high risk. The positive factors like normal weight and belief in God don't outweigh the negatives. Therefore, I'd predict he'll be rearrested within three years with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Convictions\", \"high\", \"The individual has a history of multiple prior arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of potential recidivism as they may indicate underlying behavioral issues or instability.\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without ongoing employment could present challenges leading to increased risk of engaging in criminal activities such as drug use or seeking alternative means of support.\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of a high school diploma or GED, coupled with not currently enrolled in college, may reflect limited opportunities and contribute to substance abuse issues commonly linked to recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Job Experience\", \"low\", \"Only holding one job for the past year suggests potential instability or difficulty in securing sustainable employment, which can correlate with higher risk behaviors like drug use or lack of motivation to reintegrate positively.\"),\n    (\"Drug Use History\", \"high\", \"Past four years of cocaine use indicates a substance abuse disorder, which is strongly linked to increased likelihood of engaging in criminal activities post-release as well as attempting to recover through illegal means.\"),\n    (\"Living Situation and Upbringing\", \"high\", \"Living alone at a young age in a rural household with multiple biological family members may suggest inadequate supervision or support networks that could contribute to risky behaviors and substance abuse issues.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
