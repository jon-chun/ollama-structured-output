Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White, but I don't think race is a direct indicator here unless there are systemic issues, which might be low. He has one arrest without a conviction, so that's minor and probably not a big risk yet\u2014maybe low.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and 155 lbs. While height can sometimes correlate with perceived risk in some contexts, I don't think it's directly relevant here. So maybe medium? Not sure.\n\nNever married living alone\u2014this might indicate lower stability. But he has a high school diploma and is college enrolled, which shows he's motivated to improve. Maybe medium risk because of living situation but other factors counteract that.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years; feels down recently. substance use can be a risk factor if it leads to unstable behavior. Since he's relatively young, maybe medium.\n\nYoung age, lived with both parents at five in a rural area\u2014could mean less supervision and higher likelihood of dependency or behavioral issues. That could push him towards high risk.\n\nHigh school diploma might suggest some self-control but also maybe complacency if not applying it. Medium again.\n\nConsidering all these factors: one arrest, no conviction (low), mixed living situation with substance use (medium), rural upbringing (high). He's motivated by education (maybe medium). \n\nSo combining these, the highest risk is from his rural background and past substance use. The rearrest prediction would be high because of those two strong risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests_without_conviction\", \"low\", \"This factor has a low relative weight as it involves one arrest without a conviction, which is not directly indicative of recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Substance use in the past four years (marijuana) and feelings of depression could be indicators of potential behavioral instability, contributing to medium risk.\"),\n    (\"rural_upbringing\", \"high\", \"Experiencing a household of five at a young age in a rural area is a significant risk factor due to potential lack of supervision and environmental influences that may contribute to substance abuse or unstable behavior.\"),\n    (\"motivation_from_education\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma with enrollment in college suggests some motivation, but this alone does not determine recidivism risk, contributing medium risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
