    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk for this 21-year-old Black male. He's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his race is Black. From what I know, there are systemic issues that can lead to over-policing and disproportionately affect minority groups. So being Black might put him at a higher risk compared to non-minorities with similar profiles.\n\nHe's 5'11\" and weighs 145 lbs. At his age, this could be an indicator of potential substance abuse or health issues. Maybe he has been struggling with weight or other health problems that aren't being addressed.\n\nHe\u2019s living alone without a spouse, which is common among younger men. Singlehood can sometimes be linked to higher recidivism because there's no one to provide support if things go wrong. Plus, he's not in college and hasn\u2019t held a job recently. Unemployment or lack of income stability are known risk factors for reoffending.\n\nHe\u2019s never been married, so he doesn't have any children that might offer him a sense of security or family structure which could aid in staying away from criminal activities.\n\nHis high school diploma but not enrolled in college suggests he may be underemployed or looking for better opportunities. Without ongoing education and employment support, it's easier to fall back on criminal behavior after release.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t used drugs in the past four years, so that's a positive sign. No drug use lowers the risk of reoffending through substance abuse. Also, he hasn't felt depressed recently, which is another positive indicator because depression can lead to risky behaviors if not managed.\n\nHe was living with his biological mother at a young age in an urban area. Growing up in such environments can sometimes result in higher rates of criminal behavior due to lack of supervision or exposure to negative influences.\n\nHis belief in God might provide some moral support, but it's not directly linked to recidivism unless there are other factors involved, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nPutting all these together: His background, living alone, no job, lack of education, and the social factors like being Black and raised in an urban area, along with limited support systems, all contribute to a higher risk. While some mitigating factors like no drug use are present, I think the overall risk is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Race\", \"high\", \"Being Black can increase recidivism risk due to systemic issues affecting minority groups and over-policing.\"),\n    (\"Height and Weight\", \"medium\", \"He is underweight for his height, which could indicate health issues that might affect substance abuse risk factors.\"),\n    (\"Living Arrangements\", \"high\", \"Living alone without a spouse increases risk of isolation and potential criminal behavior due to lack of support network.\"),\n    (\"Education and Employment\", \"high\", \"Not enrolled in college and no recent job can lead to underemployment or lack of opportunities, increasing risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Social Environment\", \"medium\", \"Raised in an urban area with his biological mother may have exposure to influences that could impact recidivism risk but not directly linked.\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression and drug use suggest positive mental health indicators which can mitigate risk factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
