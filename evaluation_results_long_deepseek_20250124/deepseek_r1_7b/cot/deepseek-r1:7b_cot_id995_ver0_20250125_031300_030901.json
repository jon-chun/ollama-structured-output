    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk of this 22-year-old male rearresting within three years based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's White, but I don't think race is a direct factor here unless there are systemic issues, which I'm not sure about. He's been arrested once but not convicted, so maybe that's a minor offense. Age 22 might mean he's still relatively young and has more time to develop better habits.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and 140 lbs \u2013 probably average build, nothing immediately red flags from his physique unless there's health issues involved, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Maybe living with someone else or in a dorm? Not sure how that affects recidivism, but maybe instability could be a factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, so he might have limited educational opportunities, possibly leading to substance abuse as an escape route.\n\nHe's held three jobs during the year \u2013 part-time maybe. Job experience can correlate with stability, so three jobs in a year isn't bad, but not having a stable job history could be a risk factor if it leads to financial instability or neglect of responsibilities.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use is a strong indicator of substance abuse issues, which often correlates with other risky behaviors like alcohol use, criminal behavior, etc.\n\nHe feels very down most of the time during the last month \u2013 mood disorders could lead to self-harm or substance abuse, increasing risk.\n\nEarly life living with his biological dad in a household of three. That's a typical setup; nothing immediately alarming unless there were neglect issues which aren't mentioned here.\n\nBelieving that God has no role in his personal life \u2013 this might relate to a lack of spiritual support, which can sometimes correlate with substance abuse or risky behaviors as a coping mechanism.\n\nNow, considering all these factors:\n\n- Drug use (high risk)\n- Emotional distress (high risk)\n- Unstable living situation and part-time jobs (moderate risk)\n- No education (medium risk)\n- Lack of support system (low to moderate)\n\nThe high risk factors here are drug use and emotional distress. The lower ones might balance it out a bit, but the high factors could significantly increase the risk.\n\nLooking at recidivism literature, substance abuse is a major predictor, followed by mental health issues. So this person's history points towards a higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has multiple risk factors that contribute to his likelihood of rearrest. His recent drug use and emotional distress are significant concerns, which are strong indicators in recidivism studies. These factors likely increase the risk despite some mitigating factors like part-time work and limited education.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Recent Drug Use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse is a major predictor of recidivism as it often correlates with risky behaviors such as alcohol use, criminal activity, etc.\"),\n    (\"Emotional Distress\", \"high\", \"Mood disorders or significant emotional distress can lead to self-harm or substance abuse, increasing risk factors for recidivism.\"),\n    (\"Unstable Living Situation and Part-Time Jobs\", \"moderate\", \"Living with a biological father in a household of three is typical but may lack support systems that could influence behavior and stability.\"),\n    (\"Limited Education\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can present challenges in finding stable employment and managing personal responsibilities, which might contribute to recidivism risk.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
