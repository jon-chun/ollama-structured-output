    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the recidivism risk for an 18-year-old male using his background factors. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest but no conviction. That might indicate potential for future offenses, so medium risk there.\n\nHis height and weight don't seem relevant to recidivism directly.\n\nMarital status: He's married living with his spouse. Stability in marriage could be a positive factor, possibly reducing risk.\n\nEducation level: No high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college. Lacking education might increase risk as he may not seek help or opportunities effectively.\n\nEmployment: He has held two jobs but no indication of unemployment or difficulty keeping them. Maybe relevant if he's struggling, but no info here.\n\nDrug use: He hasn't used drugs for four years; that's a good sign and can lower risk.\n\nMental health: He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which is positive as depression can contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nUpbringing: Born in a household of three ruralites. Growing up in such an environment might have had both pros and cons, but without specific issues noted, it's neutral.\n\nReligion: Believes God plays a role; that could be a mitigating factor by promoting personal accountability.\n\nConsidering all factors, the medium risk seems appropriate due to education and previous arrest. I'll assign each factor accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"previous_arrest\", \"medium\", \"The individual has one prior arrest without conviction, which suggests a potential for future criminal behavior but does not yet indicate a high risk of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"He lacks a high school diploma or GED and is not enrolled in college, which may limit his ability to secure better opportunities and reduce recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"He has held two jobs during the year without significant issues with unemployment or job instability, indicating some level of stability that could correlate with lower recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"drug_use_history\", \"low\", \"He has not used drugs in the past four years, which is a positive indicator as substance abuse can significantly increase recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"He has not felt depressed over the past month, which could be seen as a mitigating factor but without consistent mental health issues, it does not strongly indicate high risk.\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"His upbringing in a household of three in a rural area may have had both positive and negative influences, but no specific factors indicated here suggest high risk.\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"He believes God plays a role in his personal life, which could be seen as a positive factor promoting accountability and reducing criminal behavior.\"),\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 10 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse.
