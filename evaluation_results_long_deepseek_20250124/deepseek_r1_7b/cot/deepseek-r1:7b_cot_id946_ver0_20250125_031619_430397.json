    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this task where I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for a 22-year-old female. She has some factors that might influence her likelihood of reoffending in the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one and think about how they play out.\n\nFirst, she's White. I remember that race can have an impact on recidivism rates due to systemic issues like discrimination in the justice system. But since this is a risk assessment, and there are so many variables, it might be low weight compared to other factors.\n\nShe has one arrest and a conviction. That seems significant because prior convictions increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's probably medium or high weight.\n\nHer age is 22, which isn't too old yet, but she could still turn 25 in three years. Maybe there's some recidivism potential due to her youth, so maybe medium weight.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'5\" and 214 lbs. Not sure how height affects risk directly unless it relates to health issues or substance use, which isn't indicated here. So probably low weight.\n\nSeparated and living alone. Living arrangements can influence recidivism because being in a stable environment reduces stress and exposure to potential triggers. But she's separated so maybe some instability? Or perhaps living alone could increase stress, but not sure how much it impacts recidivism risk compared to other factors like substance use or prior convictions.\n\nGED certificate: She has one and isn't in college. Not completing school might correlate with higher recidivism because educational support is lacking, leading people into criminal activities. So that's medium weight.\n\nNo job during the year: Unemployment can lead to dependency on substances as a coping mechanism or lack of skills for new opportunities. This seems like it could increase risk, so medium weight.\n\nDrug use: She hasn't used drugs in four years but felt low during the past month. Her recent feeling low might be related to other issues rather than drug use. So maybe lower weight here.\n\nMental health: She's had some bad feelings recently that she can't cope with. Mental health could affect her ability to reintegrate into society or commit crimes if she's unstable. Medium weight because it's a real concern but not as direct as substance abuse.\n\nYouthful living situation at age 14 in a household of nine: That's a very large family, which might have provided emotional support and stability. It could actually reduce risk by having positive influences from others. Maybe low weight here since it was a protective environment.\n\nGod involvement: She believes in God but doesn't specify if that affects her behavior. It might not be directly related to recidivism unless there's some cultural or religious influence shaping her actions, which isn't clear. So maybe medium weight.\n\nPutting this all together: Prior arrest and conviction are high. No job is medium. GED without college is medium. Age at 22 is low? Maybe medium because she's still young but not too old. Her living situation might be protective or slightly concerning due to recent mental health issues.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate risk, maybe around 60-70% confidence that she'll rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"medium\", \"Prior arrests and convictions are significant factors in recidivism.
