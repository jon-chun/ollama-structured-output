    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male for rearrest within three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he has a criminal history with one arrest and a prior conviction. That's a red flag because having a criminal record can increase the likelihood of reoffending. So that's a high risk factor.\n\nHis age is 18, which might mean he's still developing, but since he's already been convicted once, I think that adds to his risk. Maybe it's medium or low? Wait, being young could sometimes be mitigating if he's actively working towards betterment, but here he has a prior offense, so probably high.\n\nHe identifies as White. Generally, race isn't a direct factor in recidivism unless there are systemic issues, which I don't have information on. So maybe this is low or medium. Not sure yet.\n\nHis height and weight aren't directly relevant to risk assessment, so no impact here.\n\nNo married status\u2014living alone might be due to substance use or other issues. But since he has a prior conviction, living alone could indicate avoidance of commitment, which might correlate with higher risk. Maybe medium?\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is in college. His education level can sometimes predict lower recidivism if he's committed to furthering his education. So this might be low or medium.\n\nNo job during the year\u2014he\u2019s likely inactive, which could mean he hasn\u2019t sought help for substance use or other issues. Inactive labor force can correlate with higher risk because it suggests he may not have the resources to avoid criminal behavior. So that's a high factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) is significant. Substance abuse, especially among young people, often leads to more serious offenses and can predict future substance use which might lead to more crimes. This is definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHe didn't feel depressed over the past month\u2014so no mental health issues reported, but he could still have undiagnosed problems or ongoing issues that aren\u2019t reported. But since there's no mention of mental health here, maybe it's low.\n\nEarly life living with his biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. Growing up in an unstable environment can contribute to criminal behavior and substance abuse. So this is a medium risk factor because while it's not direct cause, it's an associated risk.\n\nHe believes God has some influence over his life\u2014so he\u2019s religious but that might not directly correlate with higher or lower risk unless there are other factors related to religion, which aren't present here.\n\nPutting it all together: Prior arrest (high), substance abuse (high), inactive job (high). Education and being White don\u2019t add much. So the collective factors push towards a high risk of rearrest. Therefore, the prediction is YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\nBased on the analysis of each factor contributing to the individual's risk profile, the predicted likelihood of rearrest within three years is assessed as high due to significant risk factors such as prior criminal history, substance abuse, and inactive job status.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Prior Criminal Record\", \"high\", \"The individual has a prior arrest and conviction which significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"Substance Abuse (Marijuana & Cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Past four years of drug use correlates with potential future criminal behavior and increased risk.\"),\n    (\"Inactive Job Status\", \"high\", \"Lack of employment during the year may indicate avoidance strategies or substance use issues, both of which can predict higher recidivism rates.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
