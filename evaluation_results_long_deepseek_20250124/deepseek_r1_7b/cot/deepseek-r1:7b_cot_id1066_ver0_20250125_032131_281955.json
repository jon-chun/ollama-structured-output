    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this 18-year-old male. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's Black, but I don't think race is a direct indicator here without more context on systemic issues or personal history related to race. So maybe low weight.\n\nHe has been arrested three times and convicted once. That's a significant criminal history; multiple convictions definitely increase the risk of recidivism. So high weight.\n\nHis height and weight aren't relevant for recidivism, so that's low.\n\nUnmarried and living alone\u2014living situation can be associated with higher stress or lack of support, which might contribute to higher risk. Medium weight.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Education level is a known predictor; lower education usually correlates with higher recidivism. So medium to high.\n\nNot working during the year\u2014he's unemployed or underemployed, which can lead to poverty and increased risk of reoffending. High weight.\n\nDrug use past four years (marijuana and cocaine) suggests substance abuse issues, which are linked to recidivism. Medium to high weight.\n\nNo depression in the past month\u2014since he's not feeling depressed now, maybe lower risk from that perspective? But if it's a recent period, perhaps not directly relevant. So low weight.\n\nYounger age\u2014he was young when arrested and living with his mother; maybe he didn't have much life experience which could lead to higher risk. Medium weight.\n\nLiving alone at an urban area\u2014though urban areas don't inherently correlate with higher risk without specific issues like lack of community support or high crime rates. So low weight.\n\nBelieves in God, affecting his personal motivation\u2014no direct impact on recidivism unless there's a lack of religious support for criminal behavior, which isn't directly relevant here. Low weight.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple prior convictions (high), education issues (medium to high), unemployment (high), drug use (medium). The rest are lower factors. So the overall risk is likely high. Prediction would be \"YES\" with confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age and Family History\", \"high\", \"The individual has a significant criminal history, having been arrested three times and convicted once, which strongly indicates a higher likelihood of reoffending.
