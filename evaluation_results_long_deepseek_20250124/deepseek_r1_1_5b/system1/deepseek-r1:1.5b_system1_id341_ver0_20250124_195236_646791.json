Let me go through each aspect step by step.\n\nFirst, being 21 is within legal age for voting and driving, so that's not a risk factor. Next, he identifies as White, which doesn't seem concerning enough. He's arrested twice but hasn't been convicted\u2014this might be a red flag because sometimes convictions are based on intent or intent to harm.\n\nHe's 5 feet 10 inches, average weight of 195 lbs, and has a GED without college enrollment. No job history from the year, which is important because some risks depend on past activity. He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, which might indicate substance abuse. He hasn't felt depressed over the last month.\n\nLiving alone with his biological mom in an urban area\u2014this could be a stressor if he's relying on support systems or has issues accessing resources. He lived in a household of size 7 before getting married and now living alone. That change from 7 to 1 could affect his relationships and mental health.\n\nUsing drugs four years ago is concerning. Overcoming addiction needs time, but it might be challenging without treatment. The urban living environment could make it harder to access resources or support systems. Not feeling depressed in the past month suggests manageable stress, but substance use can still impact mood.\n\nOverall, while some factors like drug use and not feeling depressed are positive, the past convictions, substance abuse history, and living alone might indicate potential risks. The lack of education could affect criminal behavior, and urban living might pose additional challenges for someone at his age.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
