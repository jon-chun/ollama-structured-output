    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate whether the given risk factors indicate high risk based on the provided JSON structure. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't immediately raise red flags because most legal races are acceptable. He's been arrested three times and convicted, which suggests he might have some criminal history. But I'm not sure if that's high enough to classify him as a risk.\n\nNext, the person is 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 160 lbs. While body weight can vary by region, 160 lbs for someone their age isn't exceptionally low. It might be normal but not necessarily indicative of criminal behavior.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Marital status doesn't seem directly related to criminal history unless there are specific circumstances that could impact behavior. However, living alone is a common situation in many communities, so it might not add to the risk assessment much on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, which means he didn't complete his education at the time of arrest. This could be a factor because higher education often correlates with better opportunities and fewer criminal convictions if the education was done legally and without prior restrictions.\n\nHe's not employed yet, though it's more common for adults to have jobs than young people. It might indicate that he's looking for a job or hasn't found one yet, which could affect his ability to provide services or support if needed. But I'm not sure if this is a high-risk indicator.\n\nHe has held 3 jobs during the year and has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) without feeling depressed over the last month. This drug use history is significant because drug use can lead to serious criminal charges, even if it's done legally. The lack of depression might be a red flag but isn't directly linked to being a risk assessment expert.\n\nHe's living in a household of size 4 with rural roots and considers God's influence. While religious beliefs aren't typically assessed in risk assessments unless they relate to specific behaviors or deviance. This doesn't seem like a high-risk factor on its own.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some points that might raise concerns about criminal history and drug use, the other factors don't strongly indicate a high risk. The arrest frequency is low enough, the education status doesn't directly show criminal behavior, and living alone isn't a common indicator of criminal activity in young adults. Therefore, I'll classify this as NO with an 80% confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
