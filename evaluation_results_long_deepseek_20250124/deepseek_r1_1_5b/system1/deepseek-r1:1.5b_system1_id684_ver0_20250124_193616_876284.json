    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to evaluate whether the given risk factors indicate a high-risk individual based on the provided JSON structure and confidence guidelines.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the risk factors:\n\n1. 19-year-old male with Hispanic identity.\n2. Arrested once and convicted.\n3. 5'11\" height, 230 lbs weight.\n4. Never married, living alone now.\n5. High school diploma, not enrolled in college.\n6. Has held 3 jobs during the year.\n7. Used drugs (marjuana and cocaine) in the past four years.\n8. Not feeling depressed over the past month.\n9. Lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5.\n10. Considers God involved with his personal life.\n\nNow, looking at each factor:\n\n- Age: 19 is fairly young but not extremely so, especially since he's living alone and may have less social interactions.\n- Hispanic identity: This can influence behavior, often leading to issues like substance abuse or mental health problems due to cultural context.\n- Arrested once: Not many people are arrested just once, but some do. If it was severe, this could be a high risk factor.\n- Weight: 230 lbs is average for his height and gender. Doesn't seem extreme enough on its own.\n- Never married: Maybe less exposure to adult relationships, which can affect mental health and substance use.\n- Living alone: This reduces family dynamics and may lead to isolation, increasing the likelihood of substance abuse or mental health issues.\n- High school diploma: Some are out of college. If in community, it might reduce opportunities but doesn't necessarily indicate a high risk factor unless there's other evidence.\n- Not enrolled in college: Similar to above; could mean less access to resources, but not a clear indicator.\n- Drfilled in the past four years with substances (marjuana and cocaine): This is strong. substance use history of four years is substantial and may indicate risk factors for mental health issues or addiction.\n- Not feeling depressed over the past month: While important, this seems more like a general stress level rather than a specific risk factor indicating high risk.\n- Lived with biological mother in household of size 5: Maybe less exposure to family dynamics. If they're close family, it's possible but not conclusive.\n- God involved: This is subjective and varies by individual. It can't be definitively categorized as high or low risk.\n\nPutting this together, the strongest risk factors seem to be substance use history (four years) and possibly living with a biological mother in a small household. The lack of high-level stress (from the depression part) isn't enough on its own. However, each factor contributes some weight towards indicating a higher risk than average, but without specific evidence or higher-than-average severity, it's not a clear indication.\n\nSo, after evaluating all factors, I'd say this individual has a moderate risk based on substance use and possibly other elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
