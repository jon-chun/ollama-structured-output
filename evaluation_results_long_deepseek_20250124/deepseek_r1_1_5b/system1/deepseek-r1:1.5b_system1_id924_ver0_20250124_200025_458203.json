    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk. Let's break down each point step by step.\n\n1. **Age and Gender**: The person is an 18-year-old male who identifies as Hispanic. Since they're an adult, it doesn't seem like a significant concern unless there are underlying issues related to race or identity that aren't addressed here. But the presence of a high school diploma isn't mentioned, so gender alone might not be a risk factor on its own.\n\n2. **Arrest Record**: He's been arrested twice and convicted. Convictions can indicate past criminal behavior, which is a red flag for potential reoffending or severe issues that could lead to long-term health problems. This seems like a high indicator of risk.\n\n3. **Age at Arrest**: At 18, this is relatively young but not excessively so unless there are underlying health conditions like substance abuse. Given he's been using drugs and hasn't felt depressed, it might be more on the lower side than typical early adulthood for substance abuse.\n\n4. **Marital Status and Living Alone**: A single adult living alone in a small family home could present challenges if they're not stable or have other issues. The rural location is significant but doesn't inherently raise health risks unless there are underlying conditions related to living situations that aren't mentioned here.\n\n5. **Education**: He's not a high school graduate or GED, which means he hasn't completed formal education. This could be a red flag for substance abuse since people in that age group often engage with drug use. However, without specific health issues highlighted here, it's still risky but not impossible.\n\n6. **Job History and Driven Jobs**: Having two jobs might indicate financial strain, which can lead to health problems. But without specifics on how this job history affects mental health or substance use patterns, it's a bit of a gray area.\n\n7. **Drug Use Record**: He used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. This is concerning as drug abuse often leads to serious health issues like addiction, withdrawal, and mental health problems. The context doesn't specify if this was related to other issues or not, making it a strong indicator of risk.\n\n8. **Depression**: He hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression can be linked to substance use, without specific symptoms or treatment history in the given period, it's less directly indicative of long-term health risks unless there's more context on how this relates to other issues.\n\n9. **Religion**: The individual considers God nothing to do with them personally, which might indicate a lack of faith support system. However, this isn't directly linked to health or criminal behavior and is more about personal beliefs rather than factors like substance use or mental health.\n\nPutting it all together, the most significant risk factor here is his past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) for four years without treatment. This could lead to serious health problems, particularly addiction-related ones, which would indicate a high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}",
