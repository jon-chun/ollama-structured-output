Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, he's 22, male, Black, has been arrested once without conviction. That's a serious charge but not in itself a crime. He's 5'7\" and 130-149 lbs, which seems healthy for his age. Not married, living alone\u2014maybe stress or other issues prevent him from being with others. High school diploma, no college, one job since last year\u2014consistent education without further progress.\n\nHis life choices: lived with biological mother in a small family of five in an urban area. This could lead to stress, especially around work and relationships. He has drug history (cocaine, marijuana) and doesn't feel depressed over the past month. But living alone is a significant risk, especially for someone who's likely to have issues like addiction or anxiety.\n\nPutting it all together: He's at high risk because he's single, dealing with possible stress from his family and potential health issues; while he might have some strength, not being in a relationship could lead to serious consequences. The drug use adds to the mental health aspect, making the risk higher.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
