    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. So, first off, he's a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. He's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. That seems concerning because being charged with something could indicate serious behavior or underlying issues.\n\nHe's 6 feet 11 inches and weighs 220 lbs\u2014both of these are pretty short and light, which might mean he has some body issues. His height relative to his weight is a bit concerning too, but maybe not as much as other factors like the age he was arrested.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone now. That's definitely problematic because living away from family can lead to strained relationships, strained social support, and probably increased stress related to living on his own. High living standards might also come into play here.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. That could mean he's not fully prepared for the demands of college or work, which might affect his ability to handle responsibilities as an adult. If he's not attending college right now, he might have more stress from not having access to education and opportunities that others have.\n\nHe hasn't had any jobs during the past year but has used marijuana in the past four years. Using drugs like marijuana can cause serious health issues, including anxiety, depression, and social problems. If he's using it, it could be contributing to his mental health problems even though he didn't get caught for a minor offense.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is a bit unusual. Dealing with depression is tough, especially if you're not feeling well, but this seems isolated and maybe an outlier in how others are feeling.\n\nThe household was size 6, which includes his biological parents, and he's living in an urban area. Urban living can be stressful because of social interactions and the environment, but it might also mean more stress from potential relationships or responsibilities that come with being single.\n\nHe considers God to have something to do with his personal life\u2014maybe he believes in a different universe or has some spiritual aspect. This could be seen as unorthodox or not aligned with conventional values, which might raise red flags about whether someone's behavior is more likely influenced by religious beliefs than actual actions.\n\nPutting all these factors together, especially the lack of jobs, being living alone, drug use, and potentially feeling isolated or depressed, it seems like he could be at a high risk. The combination of negative behaviors and possibly unorthodox views might indicate higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
