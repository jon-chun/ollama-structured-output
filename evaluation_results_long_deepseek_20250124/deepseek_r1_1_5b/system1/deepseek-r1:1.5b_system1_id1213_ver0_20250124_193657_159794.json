    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors given by the user and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female who identifies as Black. That doesn't immediately strike me as concerning, but it could be a sign of discrimination or prejudice. I should consider her background as a potential vulnerability.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. If she was in jail for something serious like murder or robbery, that's a red flag. However, if the crime wasn't serious enough, maybe it's not an issue. But since she's black, that might be a point of concern.\n\nShe's 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 190 lbs. That's within her healthy weight range for her height. Her age seems okay as well. She's never married but is living alone. That could indicate issues with relationships or social isolation, which might affect judgment or decision-making.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. While that's not necessarily a risk factor per se, it shows she hasn't failed academically. But again, her age and lifestyle choices are more immediate concerns.\n\nShe has held one job during the year. That could indicate previous stress or responsibility. It might affect her judgment. However, if that was in a low-pressure job like teaching or customer service, maybe not as much risk.\n\nShe's never used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. These are positive factors; they don't raise flags for danger.\n\nAt 19, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size five in an urban area. That's significant because living with a family member can lead to issues like family conflict or child abuse if not handled carefully. Given she identifies as Black, that could be a sign of discrimination or prejudice.\n\nShe considers God has something to do with her personal outcomes. That's interesting but less concrete than other factors. It might indicate spiritual involvement, which could have serious implications on judgment and relationships.\n\nPutting all this together: the age, lifestyle choices, and living environment are strong indicators of potential risk. The arrest is a red flag, even if not convicted. Her background in a small household adds another layer of concern for discrimination.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}",
