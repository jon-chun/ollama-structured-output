    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\n1. **Age and Identification**: The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies as White. That seems reasonable since most people identify that way, but it doesn't jump out as alarming.\n\n2. **Arrest and Conviction Status**: He's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That could be a red flag because some crimes might require longer sentences or have complications even if the arrest happens. But I'm not sure how to evaluate this without more details.\n\n3. **Height and Weight**: 5 feet 9 inches and 143 lbs. These are average for his age, but it's something to note\u2014maybe he's at a BMI that's concerning? Not too bad, though.\n\n4. **Marriage Status**: He never married and isn't living alone. That could be a red flag because not being monogamous or living in a close marriage might indicate a lack of independence, which is risky for someone at this age.\n\n5. **Education Level**: Has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. That's pretty decent\u2014many 18-25 year-olds are in their early education phases. Not too bad.\n\n6. **Job History**: Hesitantly, he has held 4 jobs during the year. That seems low; maybe he changed roles? Or perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding. Without more context, it's hard to assess risk.\n\n7. **Drug Use and Depression**: No history of drug use or depression in the past month. While those are negative indicators, they don't necessarily indicate high risk without more details about how severe they have been.\n\n8. **Family Life in Urban Area**: Lived with biological mother in a 5-household area, which is typical for urban families but could be an issue if living conditions were poor or there were external factors affecting his well-being.\n\n9. **God Connection**: The mention of God might not directly relate to the physical health risk unless it's interpreted as a spiritual or psychological factor, which isn't typically considered in legal risk assessment.\n\nPutting this all together, while some points like being in an urban area with a 5-household family and not being monogamous are red flags about independence, they aren't extreme enough. The arrest record is on the lower end for his age without more context. The height and weight are average, and the education level is decent but not alarming by itself.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think this person isn't at high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",
