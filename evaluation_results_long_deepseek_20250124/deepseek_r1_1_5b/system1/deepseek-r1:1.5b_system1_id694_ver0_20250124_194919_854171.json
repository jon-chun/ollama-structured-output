    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the user's request. They've provided a detailed list of risk factors for a 19-year-old male and are asking if these factors indicate high risk. My task is to evaluate each factor and determine whether they point towards a \"YES\" or \"NO\" prediction with a confidence level.\n\nLooking at the first risk factor: being a 19-year-old male who identifies as White. That's generally considered okay, especially in terms of racial representation. So that might be a NO because it doesn't indicate high risk based on race or identity alone.\n\nNext, he has been arrested three times and convicted. This is concerning because multiple convictions over a short period suggest some form of criminal activity. I'll give this an 85 confidence level as it's moderately concerning but not extremely so yet.\n\nHe's 6 feet tall with no weight issues, which doesn't seem concerning for his age or body type. So that's a NO. His weight is within normal ranges, so again, not high risk.\n\nHe weighs 180 lbs and hasn't had any significant health problems mentioned. That falls under the category of \"No\" as it shows overall well-being without alarming signs.\n\nHe never married but is living alone. While single might pose some privacy concerns, it's generally considered a NO unless there are specific issues with his relationship or isolation that are severe.\n\nHis current living situation: 5 people in a city. That's more about community involvement and not necessarily high risk factors for criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college, which might indicate some educational gaps. Still, without specific concerns related to education or lack thereof, it's a NO.\n\nHe's not yet in college but has held 7 jobs over the past year, which is typical and usually doesn't indicate high risk behavior unless there are specific issues with his career choices or previous experiences that show signs of criminality.\n\nHe's used drugs for four years, including marijuana and cocaine. That's a clear indication of substance abuse, so that should be an 85 confidence level as it's concerning but not extreme yet.\n\nHe has a history of feeling down, particularly in the dumps during the past month. This emotional issue could lead to increased criminal behavior, especially if there are underlying factors like substance use. So I'll give this an 80 confidence level because while he experiences sadness and despair, his drug addiction is a more immediate risk.\n\nOverall, most of these factors point towards some form of criminal activity or significant personal issues that could contribute to future criminal behavior. However, the weight on substance abuse might be more concerning than other serious health issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. He is 6 feet 0 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 7 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 5, in an urban area. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
