    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male and Hispanic. That might raise some red flags because being Hispanic can sometimes be associated with higher rates of crime, though it varies by jurisdiction. He has been arrested twice and convicted, which is quite serious. That immediately makes me think about possible criminal behavior or intent to commit crimes.\n\nHe's 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 210 lbs. While height isn't a huge concern in this context, he seems slightly on the shorter side. His weight might affect how he interacts with others, possibly impacting his decision-making or physical health aspects, but not directly criminal risk unless there are specific issues.\n\nHe's never been married and is living alone. While living alone can lead to issues like financial instability if he can't support himself, it doesn't inherently increase criminal risk unless other factors come into play. But without a clear picture of financial stability, that might be a red flag.\n\nHis education: He doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. This could indicate lower levels of education, which might contribute to criminal behavior if there's little opportunity for higher education. However, it also means he may have less access to resources that could help him avoid criminal activities later on.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. That suggests some stability but doesn't necessarily raise immediate risk unless there are underlying issues like low job security or mental health problems affecting his job performance.\n\nDrug use: He's used marijuana in the past four years, which is concerning because substance abuse can lead to serious criminal behavior if not managed properly. However, without specific evidence of dependence or addiction, this might be an area for further investigation.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Feeling depressed can affect mental health and behavior, but it's unclear how that relates to criminal behavior unless there are comorbid issues with substance use or other potential factors.\n\nLiving in a small household (4 people) could lead to stress from limited social interaction. While this might not directly cause crime, it could impact overall well-being if he struggles with managing his environment and relationships.\n\nConsidering all these points, the fact that he's been arrested twice, has drug abuse history, possibly living alone, and low education levels can all be indicators of higher risk. However, without more specific information on how these factors have developed or any previous convictions, it's a significant but not conclusive indicator of high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",

He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year.

He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
