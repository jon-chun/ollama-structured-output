    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is at high risk based on the provided factors. Let's go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female who identifies as White. That seems neutral and not necessarily bad. However, being a minor might mean there could be some issues with handling financial responsibilities or looking out for her own needs, but I'm not sure how that affects the risk assessment here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and is convicted of some crime. There's no specific information about what she was convicted for, so it's hard to gauge any negative consequences from a past offense on her current behavior. But maybe arrest could indicate a previous problem, which might affect her overall risk.\n\nShe weighs 155 lbs. That's below average. I don't see how weight would directly impact her risk factors unless there are specific health issues mentioned that aren't here. It's probably more about general health aspects than criminal behavior.\n\nShe is married and living with her spouse. Marital stability can affect mental health, but without specific issues related to her marriage or past relationships, it doesn't seem like a high risk factor on its own.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and isn't in college. That's not bad either; it shows she's at least educated and might have some academic aspirations. But again, unless there are specific problems with education or future plans that lead to criminal behavior, it's not immediately concerning.\n\nShe has held two jobs during the year. This could be a mix of full-time and part-time roles, which is normal for adults but maybe indicates some challenges in balancing work and family life if she's a young person. However, unless there are specific past issues that led to this pattern, it doesn't strongly suggest high risk.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years. That could have negative effects on mental health, but again, without specific information about how that use relates to any criminal behavior, it's hard to link them together.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. While depression can affect mental health, feeling unwell or not well doesn't directly indicate criminal behavior unless there's a correlation between mental health issues and past behaviors.\n\nAt her age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5 in a rural area. This could relate to family dynamics affecting her mental health, but again, without specific data linking that to criminal behavior, it's unclear if this is a risk factor.\n\nShe considers God has something to do with her personal life. While religious influences can sometimes affect behavior, unless there's evidence that this relationship contributes to criminal activities or past misbehaviors, it doesn't necessarily make her at high risk.\n\nPutting all these together: weight is below average but not directly related to criminal behavior. Age being a minor might imply some challenges with financial responsibilities and family involvement, which could be factors. Marriage status affects mental health, which could impact criminal behavior indirectly. Education not being the highest level doesn't directly relate unless previous issues are linked. Job history isn't specifically negative. marijuana use could have negative effects but without correlation to past crimes. Feeling unwell might affect mental health and thus indirectly influence criminal behavior if related. Rural living and family dynamics can have various impacts, some positive or negative on mental health. Religious influences don't inherently link to criminal activities.\n\nSo overall, while there are a few factors that could relate to possible risks, the information provided doesn't strongly suggest high risk. Therefore, I would say NO with a confidence level around 70% because it's not overwhelmingly clear but also doesn't present strong evidence of high-risk behavior.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}",
