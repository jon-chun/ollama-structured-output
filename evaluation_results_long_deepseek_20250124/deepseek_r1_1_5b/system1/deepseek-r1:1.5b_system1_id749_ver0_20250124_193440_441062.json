    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male. At this age, criminal behavior can be tricky because they might not have thought much about law enforcement yet. But with some knowledge of law enforcement, they could still make mistakes or be more cautious.\n\nHe identifies himself as White, which is common and doesn't necessarily indicate a lot of risk. However, being a Black Lives Matter advocate is a significant positive factor that can contribute to better mental health outcomes later on.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That\u2019s an important point because it shows a level of accountability, even if the outcome isn\u2019t yet known. People tend to be more cautious and avoid situations where they might face criminal charges, so this could be a positive indicator of being proactive about their safety.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 11 inches, which falls within the average range for people his age. Weight is 140 lbs, also around average, though slightly below the typical weight for that height and age group. This might not directly indicate risk but could be part of a more balanced profile.\n\nHe's never been married yet and is living alone. Being single can sometimes lead to better mental health outcomes because there are fewer people in his life to interact with. However, it also means he must handle the responsibilities of being an adult, including living on his own, which might add some stress.\n\nThe person has held a job during the year but isn't currently employed. This could mean they're either looking for a new job or have some pending responsibilities that require them to stay alert. Being informed about their current status can be reassuring and help them feel more secure in their actions.\n\nHe's used substances\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Substance abuse can lead to significant mental health issues, including depression, which is a serious problem. This shows that he has a history of substance use but also has taken steps to cope with it, which could be an indicator of better self-care.\n\nLiving in an urban area might present some challenges regarding access to resources and law enforcement, especially if they're from rural areas where services are more limited. However, this is more about the environment than the individual's behavior.\n\nBeing a Black Lives Matter advocate is a positive trait that can contribute to better mental health outcomes as people often take steps to support each other in difficult situations. This could help in reducing stress and improving overall well-being.\n\nThe person considers God having something to do with their personal life, which suggests they have a sense of purpose or meaning in their actions. This aligns with positive behaviors that contribute to better mental health outcomes over time.\n\nPutting it all together, while there are some positive aspects like substance use history and being an advocate, the lack of past convictions, single status, urban living, and potentially being more cautious due to age make him a risk indicator in certain areas. However, his high school diploma and education level indicate he might not be as advanced statistically.\n\nI think this individual is at a higher end of the risk spectrum because they're showing signs of positive behavior that could contribute to better mental health, while also facing some challenges that might lead them to take more precautions or avoid criminal activities. But since their past convictions are low and their age makes them less experienced with law enforcement, it's considered high risk.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
