    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female who identifies herself as White. That seems neutral, but maybe it reflects positively or negatively depending on context. She's arrested once and convicted, which shows some criminal history. But without specifics about the crime, it's hard to assess risk here.\n\nShe's 5 feet 4 inches and weighs between 125-149 lbs. That's in a healthy weight range for her height, so maybe that doesn't indicate much risk. Her height is also average, not too short or too tall, which could be relevant.\n\nShe's never married and living alone now. Marrying someone and being single can sometimes lead to issues with relationships, but without knowing what those issues are, it's hard to tell if that affects her criminal behavior. Living alone is a significant step forward from being in a family, so maybe less likely to commit crime.\n\nHer education: she has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. That shows she's going beyond just high school, which might indicate some level of criminal awareness or knowledge about law enforcement. College can sometimes lead to better academic performance and understanding of social issues, which could be positive indicators for lower risk.\n\nShe's held jobs during the year\u2014wait, that doesn't make sense. You can't hold a job while being arrested or convicted. That seems like a red flag. Maybe she was in a job before the arrest, but now has it ended. That would indicate criminal activity and lack of stability, which could be concerning.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years: marijuana and cocaine. That\u2019s serious. She hasn\u2019t felt depressed over the past month. That\u2019s odd because feeling depressed is often a sign of mental health issues, not necessarily an indication of criminal behavior. The fact that she's used drugs but isn't feeling depressed might be misleading.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4. That suggests some family life, maybe even being raised by extended family. But living alone is significant on its own, and the fact that she's never married indicates that this was her earliest period of independence. That could be part of her history, but it doesn't necessarily indicate high risk.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personal issues. That\u2019s interesting because it adds a religious angle. Maybe she feels that God's influence is affecting her behavior or life events. But without more context on how this ties into criminal charges, it's hard to assess the overall risk.\n\nOverall, while some factors like living alone, using drugs, and never marrying seem concerning, especially regarding mental health issues, the arrest once and conviction are specific to criminal history. The other points don't add significant evidence against her unless there's a clear link between her actions and past crimes, which isn't evident here.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
