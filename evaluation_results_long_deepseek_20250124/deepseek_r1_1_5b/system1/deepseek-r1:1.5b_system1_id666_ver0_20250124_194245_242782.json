    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is at high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, he's an 18-year-old male who identifies as White. That doesn't sound like a problem. He has been arrested twice and convicted, but I don't know which charges or what they are. It's possible, though, that these might be criminal activities, especially if they relate to his history with his parents or his current situation.\n\nHe's 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 140 lbs. That's a reasonable weight for an adult, so maybe not too concerning. His height is also within normal ranges, which I think is okay.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone now. While being single can sometimes lead to stress or issues in relationships, especially if it affects finances or social interactions, that might be something to consider rather than a risk factor on its own.\n\nHe's enrolled in school at the present moment. If he's not attending school regularly, there could be financial implications, but again, not sure if that makes him high risk yet.\n\nHe has never been married and is living alone. This seems manageable unless it affects his ability to support himself financially or lead a fulfilling life. But I'm not certain how this would impact risk assessments.\n\nHis family history: he lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4, which was an urban area. That's a common setting for criminal cases because urban areas have more resources and opportunities for crimes. The fact that he considered God involved might indicate some belief or connection to the environment, but I'm not sure how that would affect risk.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Using drugs can have serious implications, but it's also possible that his recent use doesn't make him a danger. However, this does sound concerning because drug use is often a serious issue, especially for young people.\n\nHe's a high school student now, so current issues might be more about staying on track academically or dealing with the weight of living alone. That could tie into stress and mental health issues, which are risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a family history that might lead to criminal activities if not handled well, he's single but that doesn't necessarily make him high risk in itself, his current studies require attention, and his recent drug use is concerning. I think the drug use adds significant weight because it can affect mental health and overall well-being, which are critical factors for risk assessments.\n\nSo, based on all these points, I'm leaning towards yes.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 40\n}",
