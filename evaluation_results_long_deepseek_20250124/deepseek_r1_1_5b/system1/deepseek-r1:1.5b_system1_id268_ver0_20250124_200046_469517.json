    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk for someone being arrested four times. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old Hispanic male. This gender is generally considered higher risk due to cultural, social, and economic influences. His ID as Hispanic might be contributing to higher risk levels because of the associated stereotypes and behaviors.\n\nNext, he has been arrested four times and has been convicted. Four arrests are already significant. Each arrest carries a risk level, so having multiple convictions can indicate ongoing issues or past behavior that's hard to change.\n\nHe is 5 feet 8 inches, which is within average height for his age and gender. His weight of 190 lbs seems on the lower side but not concerning given his other factors. He has never been married, which might mean less personal experiences affecting criminal behavior compared to those who have had partners.\n\nLiving alone is another factor. Single individuals are at a higher risk because they face fewer resources and support systems. Their ability to form bonds or make decisions for themselves can affect their behavior and safety.\n\nHis family size of 5 (two biological parents plus three others) in an urban area might place him in a high-crime environment. Urban areas have higher levels of crime, especially against young people, which aligns with his arrest record.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but is not enrolled in college, meaning he hasn't completed education. This could indicate gaps in knowledge or skills necessary for criminal behavior. Even without formal education, cultural factors might still play a role due to the age and circumstances.\n\nHe has held three jobs during the year. His employment history can affect his criminal behavior because it may involve stressors like changes in work, financial pressures, or job security, which could influence behavior.\n\nUsing marijuana in the past four years is concerning as it significantly increases the risk of violence. Dependence on substances is a major factor in high-risk individuals.\n\nNot feeling depressed over the past month might seem positive, but depression can indeed increase criminal activity by preventing someone from making decisions about their safety and well-being.\n\nLiving with both biological parents in an urban household could place him in areas where there are higher levels of crime or social isolation. Urban living often leads to increased surveillance and security, which affects safety and mental health.\n\nConsidering that God has something to do with his life might not be directly related unless he's seeking personal guidance or purpose, but it doesn't provide a clear link to the arrest record mentioned.\n\nPutting all these factors together, especially his identity as Hispanic, his multiple convictions, family living in an urban area, lack of education, marijuana use, and living alone, each contributes to higher risk levels. His high school diploma is somewhat relevant without formal completion, but other factors are more impactful.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}",
