    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the risk factors provided for this 19-year-old female and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a Black person, which is significant because race can influence legal outcomes. But she hasn't been convicted yet, so that might not be the main issue here unless there are other factors at play.\n\nShe's 19 years old, which could indicate something related to her age, but I don't know if that's directly linked to risk factors. Her height is 5 feet 6 inches and weight 162 lbs; those are typical adult sizes for a young adult, so maybe not concerning.\n\nShe's never been married and isn't living alone, which could affect her ability to support herself financially or contribute to family issues. However, since she hasn't been convicted, the primary concern might still be legal matters related to the arrest.\n\nHer education level is low: no high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. That's a clear lack of higher education, which could lead to being caught off guard in court if there are evidence points against her.\n\nShe has held 3 jobs during the year, but since she hasn't been convicted yet, this doesn't inherently indicate a risk factor unless other factors like lack of proper documentation or evidence of past crimes are present.\n\nShe's used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. That's concerning because drug use can lead to legal issues if there's evidence against her, especially for multiple offenses.\n\nLiving with her biological mother in a household of 3 in an urban area: that's unusual since many families have more members living together, but having two kids is common. However, being raised by someone who might have influence could also affect legal status, though she hasn't been convicted yet.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests potential legal issues unless there are specific evidence points that make it non-criminally relevant. But the lack of education is a primary concern regardless of other factors.\n\nShe has lived with her biological mother for a young age, which could be concerning because being raised by someone who might have control over her life or possibly influence her behavior can affect legal outcomes. However, since she hasn't been convicted, that's more about family dynamics than criminal risk.\n\nOverall, the significant lack of higher education and potential drug use and substance abuse history raise concerns, especially in the context of not having been convicted yet. However, I need to weigh these factors against other possible issues.\n\nConsidering all these points, it does seem like there are high-risk factors here, particularly regarding her education level, potential substance abuse, and possibly living with her biological mother.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}",
