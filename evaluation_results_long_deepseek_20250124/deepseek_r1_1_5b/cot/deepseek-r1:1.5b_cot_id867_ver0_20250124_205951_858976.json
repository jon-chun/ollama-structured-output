    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is young at 19. That could be a significant risk because younger people are more likely to commit delinquent behavior and start relapsing. He was arrested three times but hasn't been convicted yet. His history of using marijuana in the past four years suggests he might engage in substance use again, which can lead to criminal behavior.\n\nNext, his life status is poor\u2014he's single living alone, not married, with a household size of four. This isolation can make someone more vulnerable to recidivism because they might struggle with financial stability and face higher risks of drug use or alcohol abuse. His family isn't close, which could create an environment where substance abuse spreads.\n\nHis education level is high school diploma but not in college, meaning he hasn't fully utilized his potential for criminal behavior through formal education. He's never been in a prison or other correctional system, so he doesn't have the support of prior convictions to carry forward criminal history. His past drug use is ongoing and intense, with moments of emotional\u4f4e\u843d that might contribute to relapsing.\n\nPutting this all together, his age, life circumstances, substance abuse history, and lack of formal education make him at high risk for rearrest within three years. The combination of these factors suggests a high likelihood of recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young\", \"high\", \"his young age poses significant risk as he may engage in delinquent behavior and relapse early\"),\n    (\"poor life status\", \"medium\", \"single living alone and not married create vulnerability to recidivism and drug use issues\"),\n    (\"intense substance use\", \"high\", \"consistent and intense use of marijuana and low emotions during dump moments hint at relapsing\"),\n    (\"unstructured criminal history\", \"low\", \"no prior convictions or formal education, meaning there's little support for carrying criminal history forward\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He has been arrested 3 times but has not been convicted. He is 6 feet 1 inch and weighs 160 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
