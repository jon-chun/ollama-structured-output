    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So the user has given a detailed scenario about a young adult who's just started their life in a household of three with his biological father. They've been involved in a past relationship but are now living alone. He has a high school diploma and isn't attending college yet. He hasn't had any substance use or feelings of depression in the past month.\n\nThe user wants me to assess each risk factor, assign weights\u2014low, medium, high\u2014and then make a prediction about his recidivism after three years. They also want the final answer as \"YES\" or \"NO\" with confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I'll break down each factor:\n\n1. **Age**: He's 20, which is young but not too old. Factors like age aren't typically major risk factors in recidivism rates across the board.\n\n2. **Marital Status**: He's single, living with his biological father. Single status might lead to issues at home, possibly increasing reoffending risks due to isolated environments or dependency concerns.\n\n3. **Religion**: Although not mentioned, religious beliefs can influence behavior and recidivism. If he identifies strongly, it could add factors like religious involvement, which might affect criminal behavior.\n\n4. **Family Structure**: A household of three includes his biological father. This smaller family size can lead to more strained relationships, possibly affecting mental health issues or motivation for reoffending.\n\n5. **Marital Commitment**: He's never married and is currently single. That might mean less stable emotional bonds, which could contribute to higher risk of relapse.\n\n6. **Education Level**: High school diploma without college. Education often correlates with criminal behavior, but it doesn't directly cause recidivism on its own.\n\n7. ** substance use**: Not mentioned, so I'll assume low or medium if he's not using substances.\n\n8. **Depression**: Only over the past month, so possible but less impactful than other factors.\n\nNow, assigning weights: Single status seems like a high risk factor because it leads to more isolation and strained relationships. Family size (three people) might also be a moderate risk due to potential mental health issues. Marital commitment without being married is low or medium since he's single. Education level is low since it's just high school.\n\nThe overall recidivism prediction would involve considering all these factors. Single status and family dynamics likely increase recidivism rates, while education and substance use might have varying impacts depending on his background.\n\nGiven that he's in a stable household but hasn't been married, single living alone could mean more issues at home, which increases the likelihood of reoffending. However, without significant substance use or depression, it might not be as high risk.\n\nAfter evaluating all factors, I'll weigh them and conclude with a prediction and confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Single status\", \"low\", \"Living with his biological father in a household of size 3 creates strained relationships and potential isolation issues affecting recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family dynamics\", \"medium\", \"The smaller family size and living situation may contribute to mental health challenges, which could influence criminal behavior and recidivism probability\"),\n    (\"Marital commitment\", \"low\", \"Single status without being married leads to less stable emotional bonds, potentially increasing reoffending risks\"),\n    (\"Education level\", \"low\", \"A high school diploma suggests a lower likelihood of criminal activity, but it may not directly cause recidivism rates as much as family dynamics and relationships do\"),\n    (\"Marital commitment without being married\", \"medium\", \"Single status implies less stable emotional connections than being married, which might influence criminal behavior more strongly compared to married individuals\"),\n    (\"Family structure\", \"low\", \"The household of three could exacerbate issues at home, such as dependency concerns, which may increase reoffending chances\"),\n    (\"Marital commitment\", \"low\", \"Single status without being married implies less emotional engagement and potentially higher risks of reoffending compared to those who are married),\n    (\"Depression over the past month\", \"medium\", \"A small window of depression could impact mental health, which may influence criminal behavior and recidivism probability\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
