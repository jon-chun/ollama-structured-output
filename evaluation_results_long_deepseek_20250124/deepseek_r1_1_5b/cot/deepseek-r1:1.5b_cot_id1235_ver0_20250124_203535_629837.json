    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assign a relative weight to each risk factor for this individual's recidivism risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is 21, which seems young but not too concerning since they're already an adult and have some job history. They identify as Black, maybe that affects their background in terms of social factors. Being 5'10\" and 170 lbs sounds average, so I don't think body weight is a huge risk factor here.\n\nHe's never been married or living with his biological mother, which might indicate he wasn't raised with that environment, possibly affecting recidivism rates. Living alone for part of the year suggests they might have experienced isolation, but I'm not sure if that's a major risk factor.\n\nHis high school diploma isn't enough to influence recidivism much since it's basic education. Not being in college means they're at an earlier stage of life and maybe less likely to engage with criminal behavior after maturity. He has held 2 jobs during the year, which could indicate they were out of school or have some work experience, but without a degree, I'm not sure.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't mentioned feeling depressed over the past month, so that might be too speculative to weight highly. The household size is small (7) and he lived with his mother, which could mean they were raised together, possibly lowering recidivism rates compared to larger households. He considers God unrelated personally, which seems a bit odd but I'll go with it.\n\nPutting this all together, the factors point towards lower risk since he's young, has some work history, is living alone, and doesn't feel depressed. The absence of significant social or family background makes me lean towards \"YES\" for recidivism at 3 years, with a medium confidence level because while there are some negative signs, the overall situation isn't looking too bad.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"young\", \"low\", \"In contrast to older adults, they may not have experienced criminal behavior or life events that carry significant risks of reoffending\"),\n    (\"unrelated personal beliefs\", \"low\", \"Although raised with a partner, their relationship doesn't suggest strong influence on future behavior\"),\n    (\"small household size\", \"low\", \"A smaller household might indicate a more focused environment and less opportunity for external influences to affect recidivism\"),\n    (\"no significant social or family background\", \"medium\", \"The absence of major social or familial factors typically reduces recidivism risks compared to those with more exposure to criminal behavior in their upbringing\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
