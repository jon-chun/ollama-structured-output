Let me go through his details step by step.\n\nHe's a 19-year-old Black male who has been arrested three times. He's black, but he didn't identify that fact in his response, which might be important for assessing his recidivism risk. He's 6'0\" and 168 lbs, which is typical for a Black male around that age. His height and weight are average, so maybe that doesn't show up as a red flag.\n\nHe never married and lives alone, which suggests he hasn't had family issues to bring up. That's something to consider because sometimes people live with their parents or step into new environments on their own, but it might not directly lead to recidivism unless there are underlying issues.\n\nHis education is a high school diploma but isn't in college, so that's maybe a sign he hasn't fully explored his options yet. He's not currently in college either, which could indicate he doesn't have much academic support or opportunities to learn about criminal justice. That might make him more likely to face challenges down the line.\n\nHe has never worked and used drugs before this year. He used marijuana four years ago and at least a third of his time in the past month felt so down that nothing could cheer him up. This drug use is concerning because it's a serious criminal behavior, especially if he's been using it for a while. Downward/upward depression can be triggers for recidivism, especially when coupled with substance abuse.\n\nHe also has no previous jobs and hasn't tried to find work since last year. That suggests he didn't seek help or opportunities to improve his life, which might lead to feeling isolated or unhelpful. Unhelpful environments are often associated with higher rates of reoffending because people feel less supported or safe.\n\nPutting all these together: He's a young adult, Black, has some substance abuse issues that could be harmful and relatable, and he hasn't had much support or opportunities to change his circumstances. These factors might increase the likelihood of him recidivism within three years.\n\nSo, the risk factors seem significant enough that the prediction should be YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\" substance abuse\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"substance use has been noted and could be a trigger for recidivism\"),\n    (\"unresolved issues\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"no previous support or opportunities suggest unhelpful environments\"),\n    (\"drugs\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"marijuana usage in past four years indicates relatable triggers and potential),\n    (\"downward/upward depression\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"phenomenon of feeling down can be a stressor affecting recidivism risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
