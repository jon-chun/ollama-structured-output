    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's rearrest in three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old Black male who's lived with his biological mother in a small household in an urban area. That might have made him feel isolated and alone, which could affect his motivation or ability to engage in criminal behavior. I think this would lead to recidivism because he might resist contact and become more dependent on family.\n\nNext, he has never been married and is living alone. Marital status can influence criminal behavior because it affects social support. Living alone might also mean less access to resources that could help him reintegrate into society or find a job. This seems like another risk factor contributing to recidivism.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, which might make it harder for him to obtain education and skills needed for reintegration. Education is often a key factor in criminal behavior, so this could be a significant risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted, but the specifics of his crimes aren't provided. I don't have much information about the nature or intent behind those crimes, which makes it hard to assess recidivism risk from that angle.\n\nHe's never used drugs in the past four years, so drug use hasn't affected him yet. However, his depression symptoms persist for a part of the past month, which might influence his decision-making and criminal behavior. Although he hasn't used drugs, the mental health issues could still contribute to recidivism risk factors.\n\nHis family life is tight\u2014four children in a household. This can make it difficult for him to maintain contact with them and seek help or support, potentially leading to feeling isolated or dependent on others. This dependency might be a strong factor contributing to recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together, the main risk factors are living alone, not having education, never using drugs, and living in an urban area which made him feel isolated. These factors combine to increase his likelihood of rearrest within three years. I'm leaning towards a high confidence prediction because these elements create a supportive environment for recidivism but also potential barriers that could hinder it.\n\nI should structure this into a JSON object with the risk factors, their textual reasoning, and then the final prediction and confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"living alone\", \"low\", \" living in a small household of size 4 in an urban area may have made him feel isolated and dependent on family.
