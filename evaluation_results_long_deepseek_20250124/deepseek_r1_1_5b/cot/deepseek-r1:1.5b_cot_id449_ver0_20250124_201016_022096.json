    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. The user has provided a detailed profile of someone who's been arrested once but hasn't convicted. They're a 20-year-old male with specific background details like his household size, jobs, education, drug usage history, depression issues, and religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to assess each risk factor individually. For the age, he's young, which typically increases recidivism rates. The gender is male, but not significantly impactful on recidivism compared to females. His race isn't specified, so that might be a factor, though since he's white and urban, maybe it doesn't add much.\n\nHousehold size being 4 in an urban area makes me think about his living situation. Urban areas can affect family dynamics, which could influence behavior. He's been married or not yet, but marriage status isn't relevant here. Since he's never lived alone, that might reduce stress and potential recidivism factors like isolation.\n\nHe has a 6-foot-2-inch height and 170 lbs weight, which are more about physical presence than risk factors. His education is a GED, not degree, but since he's not enrolled in college, maybe he lacks some academic knowledge or skills that could contribute to recidivism.\n\nNot being in college means he might lack formal learning experiences, which are sometimes associated with lower recidivism rates compared to those who have completed higher education. His drug use history over the past four years is concerning; substance abuse can lead to reoffending. He hasn't felt depressed in the past month, which could be a positive sign or potentially affect his mental health, though recidivism rates aren't directly tied to depression.\n\nHis household size of 4 suggests he may have different social interactions compared to larger households. Urban living might mean he's surrounded by similar socioeconomic groups, affecting his behavior. He considered living with his biological mother in an urban area, which could influence how he handles issues like domestic violence or custody.\n\nSince he's white and from a rural area (household size 4), that might influence his character and relationships. His religious beliefs of not involving God aren't directly relevant to recidivism but are noted.\n\nNow, weighing all these factors: age typically increases recidivism, moderate education, urban living may affect social dynamics, drug use is serious and correlates with recidivism, and living with a family member could impact mental health. But he's 20 years old, which might have some mitigating factors.\n\nPutting it all together, the probability seems high that he will rearrest within three years, but not certain. The user wants a prediction based on these risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"drugs\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\"),\n    (\"urban_living_status\", \"medium\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}\n```",
