    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to evaluate this person's risk of rearrest after three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male from a white background who's been arrested twice. That seems serious, especially since he's never married and living alone. He's in school now, so that could be a risk of finding a job or facing new challenges. But I'm not sure if that's high or medium. Maybe it's on the higher side because he's still young.\n\nHe's 6'1\" and weighs 180 lbs. That seems healthy for his age, maybe even a bit thin. Doesn't immediately raise my alarm about weight loss affecting recidivism. I'd say that's low risk here.\n\nHe has never been married and is alone now, which might make him feel isolated or vulnerable in the criminal justice system. But I don't think that's a high-risk factor unless it's accompanied by other serious issues like substance abuse.\n\nHis substance use includes marijuana and cocaine, along with not feeling depressed over the past month. That's concerning because substance abuse can be life-threatening if mishandled. It doesn't alone mean rearrest, but it does raise the alarm about mental health risks that might contribute to recidivism.\n\nHe has no prior jobs, so he might not have a stable job history. However, some people with no prior work experience still face issues like finding a new job or dealing with gang-related issues later on. But I don't think this is a high-risk factor unless there are other specific problems.\n\nThe household size was 6 in an urban area when he lived with his parents. Urban areas have higher crime rates, so that could be a risk. But how severe is it? Maybe low because it's not too big a community, but I'm still tentatively putting this on the lower side.\n\nHe considers God affecting his personal life, which is interesting. It might indicate he's seeking redemption or purpose, but unless there are deeper psychological issues, that could be mitigated over time. So maybe it doesn't add much to the risk prediction beyond what's already considered mental health-related.\n\nOverall, the key factors here seem to be substance abuse and living in a potentially high-crime urban area. While he hasn't had any prior substance use or depression, his current habits and location could significantly increase recidivism risk. The other factors like age, education, job status, and family structure aren't as prominent but might contribute some weight.\n\nSo putting it all together, the person's risk of rearrest after three years is high because of the serious substance abuse issues and the potentially high crime environment in an urban area where he lives alone. But I'm not 100% certain without more specific data on his mental health impact or any other potential negatives.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"He has used marijuana and cocaine, which can be life-threatening if mishandled.
