    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user provided a detailed scenario involving someone who is an 18-year-old male with several risk factors leading up to rearrest. They need help assigning weights to each factor to predict whether he will rearrest within three years.\n\nFirst, I should break down the risk factors one by one and assess their likelihood. The person has been arrested once but hasn't convicted. This arrest itself is a significant risk factor because it's not an easy outcome for someone of this age. Next, he's never married yet, which might indicate instability in social life. Living alone adds to isolation, another major concern.\n\nHe's enrolled in school now and used drugs in the past four years. He also experienced some emotional\u4f4e\u843d that day, leading him to feel so down. These patterns of substance use and mental health challenges should be considered as indicators of potential recidivism risks.\n\nHis household size was 4 before marriage, which is lower than many couples. This might have contributed to his isolation. His religious background doesn't seem directly relevant here since he's dealing with personal issues.\n\nNow, mapping these factors to risk levels: family separations, substance use (moderate), and emotional state (low). Each has varying degrees of impact. Family separation is a high-risk factor because it can lead to instability. Substance use might moderate this risk but could still be significant if he hasn't shown signs of recovery. Emotional low points also add to the risk.\n\nConsidering his age, previous arrests, living alone, and current education, these all point towards possible recidivism. The factors don't seem too favorable, especially with his substance use history and emotional instability.\n\nI should weigh each factor. Family separation (high), previous arrest (moderate), living alone (moderate), substance use (moderate). Emotional low points (low). Adding these up might give a moderate overall risk. But given the high family separation and potential for increased stress from being single, it's likely to be higher.\n\nSo, I'll assign medium weights to each factor except for family separation, which gets the highest weight. Then calculate the total risk as medium. Based on that, my prediction would lean towards \"YES,\" showing a moderate risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\nThe risk factors provided indicate significant potential for recidivism in this individual. However, given his age, recent history, and emotional challenges, it is reasonable to predict that he may have a moderate risk of rearrest within the next three years.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"family_separation\", \"high\", \"very stable family life has been built over many years; personal issues are less likely to affect this individual's ability to adjust\"),\n    (\"previous_arrest\", \"medium\", \"this single arrest is not an easy outcome for a young adult of his age and may significantly impact his mental health and stability in the long term\"),\n    (\"living_alone\", \"medium\", \"he has always lived with others, but his current living situation raises concerns about isolation and potential challenges for reintegration into society\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"his recent use of marijuana and some emotional low points from past interactions may indicate a need for professional help and a more difficult adjustment process\"),\n    (\"emotional_low_points\", \"low\", \"he has experienced significant emotional lows, particularly on the day he felt so down and unable to feel optimistic; these challenges may lead to increased difficulty in finding re-entry into society\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"his religious background does not appear to have a direct impact on his personal or family issues discussed here\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
