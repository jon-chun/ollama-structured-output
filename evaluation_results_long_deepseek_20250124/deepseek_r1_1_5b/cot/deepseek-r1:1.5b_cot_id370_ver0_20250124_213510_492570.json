    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's recidivism over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, being a 19-year-old male who has never been married but is currently living alone. That seems like significant stress and isolation, which could lead to withdrawal behaviors or substance use attempts. The high school diploma plus enrollment in college might indicate some academic potential, but combined with living alone, it's concerning. He used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Substance use is a major risk factor because drug-related behaviors can lead to recidivism.\n\nNext, he has two jobs during the year, which suggests some job stability and independence. However, living alone adds pressure for housing, financial security, and emotional well-being. Living alone might prevent him from seeking help or maintaining relationships, increasing his vulnerability to recidivism.\n\nHe's 6 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 165 lbs. While this is a minor physical feature, height may not be directly a risk factor unless combined with other factors like weight loss or physical activity. His body weight is somewhat low, which could contribute to issues related to job responsibilities or stress from living alone.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but hasn't completed college yet and's enrolled in a 2-year college. This indicates potential academic skills but may mean he lacks some foundational knowledge necessary for higher education. However, he still holds significant responsibility because his role as the adult child of two parents might require him to manage finances and take care of others.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted, which is a strong recidivism history. His past convictions could indicate that he's capable of reoffending if conditions remain favorable. Additionally, he has substance abuse history in the last four years, which is a major risk factor as drug use can lead to relapse and reoffending.\n\nHis life circumstances are stressful: living alone, high school diploma but potential educational gap, two jobs, substance abuse history. These factors create a complex picture where multiple variables contribute to his recidivism risk.\n\nConsidering all these elements\u2014high risk of substance use due to past drug use, isolation leading to withdrawal and stress, job stability might provide some relief but combined with living alone, low academic performance as he's at the 2-year college stage, and high physical and emotional health issues like weight, which could contribute to mental health concerns\u2014this individual is significantly at risk for recidivism within three years.\n\nThe factors are interrelated. The substance abuse history is a strong indicator of potential recidivism. Living alone and being isolated further exacerbate stress and anxiety, leading to withdrawal behaviors or attempt to escape from situations that may make him more susceptible to reoffending. His job stability might allow some coping mechanisms if issues arise but still, the isolation adds significant weight.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors together, this individual's risk of rearrest within three years is very high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"substance_use_history\", \"high\", \"past drug use and substance abuse history in the past four years\"),\n    (\"isolated living\", \"high\", \"living alone significantly contributing to stress and isolation, affecting withdrawal behaviors and attempt to escape situations\"),\n    (\"low_academic_performance\", \"high\", \"being at the 2-year college stage despite high school diploma, potentially limiting job opportunities but not fully addressing his responsibilities),\n    (\"job_stability\", \"medium\", \"job stability might provide some relief but combined with living alone increases stress and anxiety\"),\n    (\"weight_loss potential\", \"low\", \"his body weight is somewhat low, which could contribute to issues related to job responsibilities or stress from living alone\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
