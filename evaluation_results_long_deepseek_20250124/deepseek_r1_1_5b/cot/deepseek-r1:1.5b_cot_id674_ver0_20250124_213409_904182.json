Let's see what factors are at play here.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male from a white background who's been arrested once. He hasn't used drugs or felt depressed in the past month, which is positive. But as a young adult, living with his biological mom in a small household might limit access to social support, especially if they're separated.\n\nHe has no college education and only a high school diploma. That's a big gap; he needs some experience to reenter society. He's never married, so the societal pressure from being single can be a barrier. Also, having lived alone for 14 years might make him feel isolated or vulnerable if he experiences some kind of crisis.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't convicted. That could mean he's not fully reintegrating yet, leaving others to guess. His background as someone raised by only his biological mom adds another layer; it can influence how he deals with his issues and the societal pressures around him.\n\nHis family history is simple\u2014just two parents. Without any social support from family or peers, especially when separated, it's harder for him to build a stable life after being released. The age group of 21 might push this into more danger because they're at the transition between high school and college, which can be a point where risks increase.\n\nHis criminal history is just one arrest; he hasn't been convicted yet. That could mean he's not fully reintegrating, leaving others to worry about his future. The lack of any substance abuse problems or depression doesn't make him more vulnerable, but the age and living situation do.\n\nPutting it all together, this person has gaps in education and experience that can hinder their ability to reenter society. The social isolation from family and previous experiences adds another barrier. Without any support networks or social connections, especially when separated for so long, this risk is significant.\n\nI think the likelihood of him rearresting is high because he's at a critical age with limited support systems and no experience in a stable environment. His criminal history being short doesn't change that much. The family background alone can be a significant factor, and living apart from his biological parents adds another layer of vulnerability.\n\nSo, my prediction would lean towards a high risk of rearrest because of the lack of proper social support, limited education, and the age group's transition from being in the public environment to more vulnerable situations.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"high\", \"the young person has gaps in his education and lacks criminal history but is at an age where social isolation is significant\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"high\", \"the person's family background alone can be a significant factor, and living apart from his biological parents adds vulnerability\"),\n    (\"factor3\", \"medium\", \"his lack of experience and limited support systems further contribute to potential risks\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
