    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this specific case based on the given risk factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's look at each of the person's characteristics and how they might affect their recidivism risk.\n\n1. **Gender (Black)**: Black people often face higher recidivism rates compared to non-Black individuals. This could be a factor.\n\n2. **Arrest vs. Conviction**: She hasn't been convicted but is currently arrested, which suggests there's some ongoing problem with her behavior or mental state.\n\n3. **Weight (5 feet 9 inches, 175-199 lbs)**: This seems like a normal weight for her age and gender, so maybe not a significant factor here.\n\n4. **Married vs. Not Married**: She's single now, which might indicate less stress or uncertainty compared to someone who is married. But I'm not sure how that directly affects recidivism.\n\n5. **No Jobs During the Year**: The fact that she hasn't had any jobs since moving into a household could mean she's not contributing financially, which might make her more likely to reoffend.\n\n6. **Used Marijuana**: She has used it in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed. Using marijuana can be a problem, so maybe this contributes to some underlying issues or stress.\n\n7. **GED Certificate**: She has a high school diploma now, but she's not enrolled in college. This could mean she's working part-time without much income, which might indicate financial instability and stress from that.\n\n8. **Household Size (4 people)**: A family of four living in an urban area might offer more support, but since she's single, maybe it's less stressful than a larger household.\n\n9. **Lived with Her Biological Mother**: Being raised by her biological parent could provide emotional and social stability, which might reduce recidivism risk.\n\nNow, considering these factors together:\n\n- The lack of a GED is concerning because many Black individuals without a high school diploma have higher recidivism rates.\n- She's been arrested but not convicted, indicating that she hasn't fully addressed her issues with the law or mental health.\n- Using marijuana adds stress and potential negative psychological impact over time.\n- Not being married might mean less pressure from societal expectations, which could be mitigating some risks.\n\nHowever, factors like being raised by a parent (household size 4) provide stability. But the lack of a GED is still a significant risk factor in this context.\n\nI'm leaning towards a moderate recidivism risk because she has some underlying issues but also has support structures in place. The data doesn't show extreme high risks, so maybe it's more likely to stay in the \"NO\" category.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis indicates that while there are some risks due to lack of education and substance use, these are mitigated by family and living situation factors. \n\n**Risk Factors:**\n- Low (L): No GED is concerning for Black individuals without higher education.\n- Medium (M): Marriage status and jobless year might contribute but aren't as significant as other issues.\n- Medium (M): Single status and support from family provide stability.\n\n**Prediction:** NO\n\n**Confidence:** 45%\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"no_ged\", \"low\", \"Black individuals without a GED face higher recidivism rates, impacting their chances of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"married_status\", \"medium\", \"Single status might reduce stress and uncertainty in decision-making, potentially lowering risk.\"),\n    (\"jobless_year\", \"medium\", \"Jobless year indicates potential stress from financial instability, which could contribute to risk despite other mitigating factors.\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
