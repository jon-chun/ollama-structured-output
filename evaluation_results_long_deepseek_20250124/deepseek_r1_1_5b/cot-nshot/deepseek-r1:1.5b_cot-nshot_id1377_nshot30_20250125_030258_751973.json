    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the recidivism outcome for this 21-year-old mixed race female. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a mixed race, which might complicate things since race can influence criminal behavior in various ways. But the examples don't have mixed races with outcomes, so maybe I'll assign it based on other factors.\n\nShe was arrested twice and convicted, which are serious crimes. From the examples, more convictions usually lead to recidivism because they show a history of reoffending. That's a high risk factor.\n\nNext, her weight is low because she doesn't have a high school diploma or GED. Without education, criminal behavior might be harder to sustain, so that's another high risk.\n\nShe has no college enrollment, which probably means lower likelihood of higher education, but since it's about recidivism, maybe it still affects her ability to reintegrate. That could be a medium risk.\n\nShe's married and living with her spouse. Single individuals might have higher risk factors because they're more vulnerable to criminal behavior. So that's another high risk.\n\nHer weight is low again, no diploma or GED. She has one job during the year, which doesn't seem too bad. But she uses cocaine all the time, which is a drug problem. That's a very high risk factor for substance abuse, which can be an early sign of recidivism.\n\nShe lived in a rural area with her biological mother, so perhaps living in such conditions might not directly contribute but could mean less family support or community involvement, though that's more about co-risks than individual factors. Still, the lack of education and weight are significant.\n\nPutting it all together: high convictions, low education, medium college enrollment (maybe?), low single status, very high substance use (cocaine), and rural living. The combination of being a mixed race might add another layer, but not sure how much. But overall, the high number of risks seems to point towards her having a higher chance.\n\nThe examples don't have this exact case, but considering all these factors\u2014high convictions, low education, substance abuse, maybe some support issues due to rural living\u2014it's likely she has a higher recidivism risk than others without those issues. So the outcome is probably NO.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrests/crimes\", \"high\", \"She has been arrested twice and convicted, indicating a history of reoffending which is associated with higher recidivism rates.\"),\n    (\"weight\", \"low\", \"She does not hold a high school diploma or GED certificate, which limits her ability to engage in criminal behavior through education and possibly opportunities to reintegrate into society\"),\n    (\"college enrollment\", \"high\", \"She is currently not enrolled in college, suggesting she may face challenges in accessing higher education and criminal justice pathways which could contribute to reoffending.\"),\n    (\"cohabitation/single status\", \"high\", \"Being a mixed race, as well as living with her spouse or being single, indicates vulnerability to criminal behavior because it may lead to more frequent contact with law enforcement, authorities, and potential opportunities for reintegrating into society.\"),\n    (\"substance abuse\", \"very high\", \"She consistently usescocaine without stopping, which is a serious and long-term substance abuse problem that can significantly increase the risk of recidivism by disrupting normal life and increasing legal consequences.\"), \n    (\"rural living\", \"low\", \"Living in a rural area may reduce community support for criminal behavior but does not inherently prevent reoffending.
