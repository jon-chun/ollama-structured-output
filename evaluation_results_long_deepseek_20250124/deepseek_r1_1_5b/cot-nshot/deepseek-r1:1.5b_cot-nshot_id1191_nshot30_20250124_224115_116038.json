    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism outcome for this case based on the given risk factors. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the person's background: He's a 22-year-old male from Black community, lived in urban area, with no previous arrests or convictions. No job history since he just started college and didn't have much work experience yet. He has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. He used to drink heavily but now uses methamphetamine, which hasn't worked. Also, he's not depressed.\n\nLooking at the risk factors from examples:\n\n1. High school diploma: In example #7, someone with no high school diploma had low recidivism because they were already out of education. So, a lack of education can lower recidivism.\n2. Not married or previously married: If someone is single and hasn't married before, that might reduce recidivism as they have fewer family ties to reintegrate.\n3. No previous convictions or arrests: Even without prior issues, no past history reduces the chance of re-arresting in the next three years.\n4. No significant life events like moving, divorce, etc.: These can impact re-offending rates because a stable environment helps with recidivism.\n5. Low income and no education: If he's from a poor family without formal education, that could make it harder to reintegrate into society.\n6. No substance use history but has meth use now: Methamphetamine is a form of drug use; even if he hasn't used it before, new habits can contribute to reoffending.\n\nNow, applying these to the case:\n\n- High school diploma: He's just started college, so maybe his education isn't fully developed yet. But in example #7, someone with no high school had low recidivism because they were out of education; he has some degree.\n- Not married or previously married: Since he's single and hasn't married before, this might lower recidivism as he has fewer ties to reintegrate.\n- No prior convictions: He's clean from past issues like drug use. No prior problems mean less risk.\n- No job history since just started college: A lack of employment history can make someone more likely to have a stable job later on, reducing the chance of re-arresting.\n- Low income and no education: He's from a Black community; maybe that contributes to lower recidivism rates because he's in an environment without much social support. Plus, he has no formal education yet.\n- No substance use history but now uses meth: Methamphetamine is heavy on recidivism. Since he hasn't used it before and just started, this might pose a risk.\n\nPutting it all together, the person is from a low-income background with little formal education. He's single, has a high school diploma but maybe not fully developed yet. No previous issues, no job history, and now uses meth. These factors suggest a lower recidivism rate. In contrast, someone with no education or substance use before might have higher rates because it's harder to integrate.\n\nSo, after considering all these points, the prediction is that this person has low recidivism risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"High school diploma\", \"medium\", \"He has completed high school but may not be fully developed in his education; potential limited integration opportunities due to lack of formal education.\",\n    \"The individual has a high school diploma and is still starting college, which may limit his ability to integrate into society.
