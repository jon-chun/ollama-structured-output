    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk factors for this case. The person is a 21-year-old Hispanic female. Let me break down each risk factor step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested 4 times and convicted. That's quite high because being in prison multiple times can be serious. I think that would increase recidivism chances because the criminal history adds weight to why they might reoffend.\n\nNext, she has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Not having a degree doesn't necessarily mean she'll recidivate; it just means she's out of education, which could be another barrier. But since she's not married and is single, maybe her age and living alone play roles too. But with the 4 arrests, I'm leaning towards higher risk.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but lacks college credit. That might mean more time away from formal education, possibly affecting reintegration into society. But again, the multiple convictions seem significant.\n\nShe's lived in a household of size 6 for her young age. Having close family members around can make it harder to move out or find support systems. That could contribute to recidivism because the strain might impact their ability to commit a crime.\n\nHer family ties are extensive, which adds stress and expectations. It makes it harder for her to take control of her life without support from others. I'm thinking this could increase the risk.\n\nShe's lived with both biological parents in a rural area. Being raised by her parents can have psychological effects that might make her more likely to reoffend or feel isolated, which is bad for recidivism.\n\nHer age and family issues complicate things. Young adults often face more stress due to responsibilities. The stress from living alone and being taken care of by others could lead to higher likelihoods of reoffending.\n\nShe has used both marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Using prescription drugs can increase the risk because they're often associated with relapse. But I'm not sure if she's using them recreationally or heavily, which would make a big difference.\n\nHer living situation is challenging. She's been in a household of size 6, possibly having her own children or other responsibilities. Strained relationships can cause anxiety and increased likelihood of reoffending.\n\nThe psychological impact of being in such a tough spot could lead to substance use and mental health issues, all of which contribute to recidivism. The combination of high conviction history, family issues, living alone, drug use, and stress might significantly increase the risk.\n\nI think these factors together make it highly likely that she will rearrest within three years. So, I'm leaning towards a high confidence prediction.\n</think>\n\nThe case involves a 21-year-old Hispanic female with multiple convictions, a lack of formal education, extensive family ties, living in a stressful environment, and drug use. These factors significantly increase the likelihood of recidivism.\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"high\", \"The repeating of crimes within three years raises a high risk of reoffending\"),\n    (\"family support\", \"medium\", \"Family ties complicate living with stress, increasing the risk\"),\n    (\"drugs use\", \"high\", \"Use of substances like marijuana and cocaine increases recidivism chances\"),\n    (\"living situation\", \"low\", \"Stress from family and living in a tight household impacts behavior\"),\n    (\"psychological impact\", \"medium\", \"Challenging living conditions contribute to anxiety and mental health issues affecting reoffending\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
