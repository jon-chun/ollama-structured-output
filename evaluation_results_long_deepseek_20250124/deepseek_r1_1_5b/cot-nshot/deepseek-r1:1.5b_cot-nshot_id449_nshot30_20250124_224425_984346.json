    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the recidivism risk factors for this 20-year-old White male. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, he's a 20-year-old living in an urban area with a family of four. His main issues are being arrested once but not convicted, holding two jobs, using multiple drugs (marijuana and cocaine), feeling depressed for the past month without any immediate relief. He's married and currently not living alone.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, especially the 27 and 30 cases where he was a Black male or Hispanic female, I notice that being married and not living alone might be factors because they can influence behavior. Since he's married, maybe he doesn't feel free to leave his place of residence, which could affect recidivism.\n\nThe fact that he's holding two jobs is interesting. Having multiple income sources might make him more likely to stay employed or have higher earnings. But the recidivism examples don't show high numbers for people with multiple jobs, so I'm not sure yet.\n\nHis family size of four and living in an urban area could contribute because being in a safe environment might reduce his tendency to leave. The fact that he's currently married makes me think about how he interacts with others; perhaps he's more likely to stay within the community without leaving for higher up, which would affect recidivism.\n\nThe drug use is a big issue here. He uses both marijuana and cocaine. Even though he's currently married and not living alone, using multiple substances can lead to substance abuse, which might make him more likely to reoffend. The fact that he hasn't felt depressed for months without any immediate relief could be significant because feeling low puts more pressure on him.\n\nHe's a White male with no high school diploma or GED. In the examples where he had no diploma, like 28 and 30 cases, his recidivism was \"NO.\" But since he has a GED and isn't enrolled in college, maybe it helps with learning new skills, which could reduce recidivism.\n\nHis family size being small and living in an urban area might mean more social connections. If he doesn't have many friends or support systems around him, he might be more likely to leave for higher up or stay away from the community, increasing his risk of reoffending.\n\nPutting it all together: He's married (maybe reduces leaving), holding two jobs (maybe less likely to leave without income), family in urban area (safe environment), multiple substance use (abuse increases recidivism), and living alone (more time away). \n\nHowever, the fact that he's already a White male might mean he has access to more resources or support systems. But since he's married, perhaps he's not as likely as someone from an underclass who can get help.\n\nThe lack of high school diploma could be problematic because without education, he might struggle with learning new skills needed for work or jobs in the future. Without a GED, maybe his ability to handle substance abuse is limited, which ties into recidivism.\n\nSo overall, while there are some positive factors like being married and holding two jobs, the negative ones include multiple substance use, not feeling depressed, living alone (if that's causing time away), and the education gap. The family size might be a bit concerning because smaller families can lead to more isolation or less support from others.\n\nBut considering he's White, maybe there are some support systems in place. Still, the lack of education and substance use are strong negatives. The recidivism seems high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"married\", \"medium\", \"being married may reduce leaving for higher up\"),\n    (\"holding two jobs\", \"low\", \"two income sources might make him more likely to stay\"),\n    (\"family size of four\", \"low\", \"small family could lead to isolation and less support\"),\n    (\"multiple substance use (marijuana, cocaine)\", \"medium\", \"substance abuse increases recidivism\"),\n    (\"living alone and not feeling depressed over months\", \"medium\", \"depression can put more pressure on individuals considering leaving for higher up\"),\n    (\"no high school diploma or GED\", \"low\", \"limited education could hinder job finding in the future\"),\n    (\"family size of four in urban area\", \"low\", \"safe environment might reduce time away from community\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 50\n}",
