    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict the recidivism rate for this specific case using a weighted risk factor analysis. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the individual's background:\n\nShe's a 20-year-old Black female. She hasn't been arrested yet but has 1 prior arrest without conviction. She's 5'2\" and weighs 120 lbs. She never married and is living alone. She has a high school diploma but not in college, holds two jobs, hasn't used drugs in the past four years, except for some time where she felt down, leading to a lot of stress.\n\nHer residence: She lived with her biological dad in a household of 4 in an urban area. She's considered by God because that's how her dad lives and they're close.\n\nNow, looking at the risk factors from the examples:\n\n1. Reside with biological father (determined by DNA evidence) is often associated with recidivism. Since she lived with her dad, this might be a high risk factor.\n2. No prior arrest: Maybe lower risk since there's no one else who has been around for comparison.\n3. No substance use: She hasn't used drugs in four years. Using drugs is linked to low recidivism because drug users tend not to reoffend.\n4. Living alone: High risk because single people are more likely to reoffend, especially those from families that can't help or have strained relationships.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- Reside with biological father (high)\n- No prior arrest (low) but she did have one arrest without conviction, which is a bit contradictory.\n- No substance use (maybe low)\n- Living alone (high)\n- Stress and mood issues from being down in the dumps (medium)\n\nWait, maybe I should prioritize the factors. The most significant ones are living alone and being with her biological father, as they suggest higher risk of reoffending. So she's at a high risk.\n\nLooking back at examples: People who lived with their biological parents had higher recidivism rates. Also, others who resided with a parent or close family group showed increased recidivism.\n\nSince this person lived in a small family (household size 4) and was alone, that adds to the risk. Plus, being with a father who might be stressed or have strained relationships could contribute.\n\nSo overall, it seems she's at high risk for recidivism.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"reside_with_biological_father\", \"high\", \"She lived in a household of four with her biological father, which is strongly associated with higher recidivism rates due to strained relationships and family dynamics that may encourage reoffending\"),\n    (\"no_prior_arrest\", \"low\", \"While she has one prior arrest without conviction, this could be seen as a low risk indicator in comparison to others who have no arrests\"),\n    (\"reside_with_cousins_or_familial_family\", \"high\", \"She resided with her biological father and possibly other family members, which can significantly increase recidivism chances\"),\n    (\"no_substance_use\", \"low\", \"Her history of substance abuse is limited, but it's not the highest risk factor here because she hasn't used drugs in four years\"),\n    (\"living_alone_or_with_single_person\", \"high\", \"Living alone or with others who may be distant and strained can lead to increased recidivism\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}",
