    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to help predict the 3-year rearrest recidivism for this case using the given risk factors. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old female who's White. She's lived with her biological parents in a small rural household of size four. That seems like a small area, which might mean less chance to change their mind. She's 5'5\" and weighs about 150-174 lbs. They've never married yet, so there's no potential for legal issues due to family ties.\n\nShe's got a Bachelor's degree but is enrolled in a graduate program, which means she's actively pursuing education. That might indicate some level of commitment or academic strength. She hasn't been arrested or convicted before; that's good because it reduces the risk of her being caught again if something happens. But she has 1 arrest without conviction\u2014maybe some underlying issues?\n\nShe's married but in a rural household, which is interesting. Maybe she has some other unresolved issues from previous relationships. She's held two jobs during the year, which could mean more responsibilities or potential for job-related issues later on.\n\nShe's lived with her parents since childhood, so maybe she has a family history of some kind of problem behavior or mental health struggles. The fact that she's 22 is also relevant because age can affect recidivism rates; younger people might be less likely to reoffend if they're in good shape.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, many factors with \"no arrest\" and low recidivism outcomes were given high weights, like 90-100%. So this case has no arrests, which is a plus. She's married but rural, so that might contribute to some challenges. She's got a degree but in pursuit, and she's in a small household.\n\nShe's experiencing a lot of stress from her current marital issues or living situation, especially the down feeling during one month. This could lead to depression or anxiety, which are common in substance abuse, even though she hasn't used drugs yet. But since she hasn't been convicted, maybe that doesn't directly contribute unless there's an underlying mental health issue.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's and is in grad school, so her education level might be a factor. However, if she's not attending college full-time or has other commitments, that could reduce her ability to handle responsibilities. But since she's in a graduate program, it shows she's committed.\n\nThe key points here are the lack of arrest, which is a strong indicator; living with parents in a rural area might limit opportunities for better support systems; and she's engaged in multiple jobs, possibly leading to more stress factors. However, there's some unresolved issues from her marriage or family problems that could be contributing.\n\nGiven all this, I think the recidivism outcome should be high because she's young (though 22 isn't too old), has a degree with higher education, and is in a household size that might limit opportunities but also experience stress factors. So the weight would be medium-high.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Married but rural household of four\", \"low\", \"Living with parents limits opportunities; unresolved marriage issues\"),\n    (\"Completed Bachelor's degree\", \"medium\", \"Active pursuit of education and potential academic strength\"),\n    (\"In graduate program\", \"high\", \"Commitment to learning and future challenges\"),\n    (\"Lived with two jobs during the year\", \"medium\", \"Potential for increased responsibilities and stress\"),\n    (\" experiences a lot of stress from marital issues or living situation, especially the down feeling during one month; substance abuse potential\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
