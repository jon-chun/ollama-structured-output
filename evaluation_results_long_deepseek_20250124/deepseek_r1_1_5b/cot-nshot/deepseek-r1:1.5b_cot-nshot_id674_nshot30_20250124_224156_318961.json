    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's take a look at this case. The person is a 21-year-old male who identifies himself as White. He's been arrested once and has been convicted. That's a serious first-degree crime, which usually leads to longer sentences but also higher risk of recidivism.\n\nHe weighs 5 feet 10 inches and is 171 lbs, which sounds about right for his age. He hasn't had any relationships yet, so that should help him stay single and less likely to change that. He's a high school graduate without college enrollment, meaning he didn't go to college before starting this situation.\n\nHe's lived with his biological mother in a household of size 9. That seems like a large family, which might have affected his behavior because he has more support systems around him. He's not married yet, so no romantic pressure from being single. His past includes no jobs during the year and hasn't used drugs or been depressed for the last month. \n\nLooking at the examples provided, factors that are met with very little risk (low) like a minor offense, no family issues, high school diploma, living alone, no recent drug use, and not being depressed all lead to low recidivism. Since this person has it all\u2014arrested once, conviction, high school diploma, single, no recent issues\u2014he should be at the lowest risk level.\n\nThe examples show that when these factors are present with minimal risk, the outcome is \"NO\" for rearrest. So in this case, his combination of being a minor offender, having a high school diploma, living alone, and not facing any immediate stress makes him very low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrested_once\", \"low\", \"The individual has been charged with a serious first-degree crime, which carries significant risks of reoffending.\"),\n    (\"highschool_diploma\", \"low\", \"He is a high school graduate and did not pursue college before this situation.\",\n    \"no further issues in his life that could impact behavior or motivation to change.\",\n    \"lived_alone\", \"low\", \"Living with only his biological mother implies he has minimal support systems around him, which can be beneficial for reoffending.\"),\n    \"not_made_drug_use_recently\", \"low\", \"He hasn't used substances in the past month and doesn't currently feel depressed.\",\n    \"not_being_depressed_recently\", \"low\", \"His recent mood has been stable and positive.\",\n    \"no_new_marrying\", \"low\", \"He is not married yet, so there's no romantic pressure from being single.\"),\n    \"low\",\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 10\n}\n```",
