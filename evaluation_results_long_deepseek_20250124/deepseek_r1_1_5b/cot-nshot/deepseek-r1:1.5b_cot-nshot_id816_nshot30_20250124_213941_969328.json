    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to figure out the recidivism prediction for this case. The person is a 20-year-old female who identifies as White. She's just started college after being in a high school diploma program. She's 5'4\" and weighs 110 lbs. She's never married and not living alone, has a job, used marijuana, didn't feel depressed for the past month. Lived with her biological parents in a rural area.\n\nLooking at the examples provided, most cases where the recidivism was NO had low risk factors. For instance, if someone is employed (high), has no previous criminal record or arrest (medium?), no immediate depression (medium), and not living alone (medium). But wait, this person isn't employed\u2014she's a student. She's involved with marijuana, which could be a significant factor for recidivism. Also, she didn't feel depressed, but her weight on the job is low because she's studying instead of working.\n\nThe high school diploma is part of the factors, but she's at 2-year college now, so maybe that's an indicator of better life skills, which could be protective against recidivism. She's aWhite person who's not married and living alone\u2014maybe that's associated with lower recidivism rates compared to other groups.\n\nShe has a moderate risk of being found guilty based on the arrest history (1 time), but she's not facing any immediate consequences. The low weight on her job is also positive. However, the use of marijuana might lead to negative mental health outcomes or substance use issues, which could increase recidivism rates.\n\nConsidering all these factors: she has no criminal record (low), didn't live with anyone else for a while, not in a high-crime area, but has an active weight on marijuana and hasn't felt depressed. The college is two years, so maybe better life skills are present. But the arrest once\u2014maybe that's moderate risk.\n\nPutting it all together: low to medium risk factors might lead to lower recidivism rates compared to cases with higher risk. So, this case is probably in the NO category because her low risk factors make her less likely to rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest history\", \"low\", \"She has a history of being arrested once, which may indicate potential recidivism but isn't a severe factor given no immediate consequences\"),\n    (\"weight on marijuana\", \"medium\", \"Her use of marijuana might lead to negative impacts like mental health issues or substance abuse, increasing the risk\"),\n    (\"low weight on job (2-year college)\", \"low\", \"She is in higher education and may have better life skills compared to those with a full-time job without experience\"),\n    (\"no previous criminal record\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions; this reduces recidivism likelihood),\n    (\"lived alone for the past month\", \"medium\", \"Even though she didn't feel depressed, living in an unfamiliar area might affect her mental health and behavior),\n    (\"\u519c\u6751 living with biological parents\", \"medium\", \"Rural setting often correlates with lower recidivism rates due to social and environmental factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 30\n}\n```",
