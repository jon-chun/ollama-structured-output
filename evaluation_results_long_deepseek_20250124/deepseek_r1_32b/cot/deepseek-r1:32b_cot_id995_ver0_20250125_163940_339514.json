    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this person's rearrest within three years. Let me start by breaking down each piece of information given about him.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male, which is a relatively young age. I remember that younger individuals are often associated with higher recidivism rates because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. So, his age could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can sometimes influence interactions with the criminal justice system, but this isn't a direct cause of rearrest. It might have some indirect effects, so I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. An arrest without conviction is less severe than a conviction, but it still shows some involvement in the criminal justice system. This probably contributes to a moderate risk level.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'7\" and 140 lbs. Physical size isn't typically a strong predictor of rearrest, so I'll consider this low risk.\n\nHe's never been married and isn't living alone. Living arrangements can influence behavior; someone not living alone might have less supervision or different social dynamics. Being unmarried might also affect his support network. This seems like a moderate factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a significant predictor of recidivism. Without education, job opportunities are limited, which can increase the risk of criminal behavior. That's definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHe held three jobs in the past year. Job stability matters because consistent employment reduces the likelihood of rearrest. Three jobs might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, so this is probably a moderate risk.\n\nDrug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Substance abuse is strongly linked to criminal behavior and recidivism. Both drugs have significant impacts, making this a high-risk factor.\n\nHe's felt very down for most of the past month. Mental health issues like depression can lead to substance abuse or other behaviors that increase rearrest risk. This is another high-risk factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological dad in a household of size three. Family structure can influence behavior. Growing up without both parents might contribute to higher risk, but it's not as strong as some other factors. I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nHe doesn't believe God has any role in his personal life. Religious involvement is sometimes linked with lower recidivism rates, so a lack of belief could be a moderate factor here.\n\nPutting all these together, the high-risk factors are education level, drug use, and mental health. Moderate factors include age, arrest history, living situation, job stability, and religious beliefs. Low risks are race, physical size, family structure, and marital status.\n\nConsidering all these, the prediction leans towards a higher risk of rearrest. The confidence is fairly high because several strong predictors point to that outcome.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race has indirect effects on interactions but not direct cause\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"moderate\", \"One arrest without conviction shows some criminal involvement\"),\n     (\"physical_size\", \"low\", \"Height and weight aren't strong predictors of rearrest\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and not living alone may affect social dynamics\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED limits job opportunities, increasing risk\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"moderate\", \"Holding three jobs indicates potential instability\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse linked to criminal behavior and recidivism\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Depression can lead to substance abuse or other risky behaviors\"),\n     (\"family_structure\", \"low\", \"Growing up with one parent may contribute but isn't a strong factor\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief might reduce protective factors\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}",
