    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, gender: she's female. From what I know, females generally have lower recidivism rates compared to males. So I'll mark this as low risk.\n\nAge is 21. Younger individuals are typically at higher risk because they're more likely to engage in risky behaviors. Twenty-one is still quite young, so medium risk here.\n\nRace: she identifies as White. There isn't strong evidence that race itself is a significant predictor of recidivism when other factors are controlled. So low risk.\n\nShe's been arrested twice and has a conviction. Having prior arrests and convictions increases the likelihood of future offenses. That's definitely a high-risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'5\" and 140 lbs. These are average stats and don't indicate any particular risk. Low risk here.\n\nMarital status is divorced, living alone. Being single or living alone can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism because of potential social isolation. I'll rate this as medium.\n\nEducation: no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a strong predictor of criminal behavior and recidivism. High risk here.\n\nEmployment status: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to increased stress and fewer positive activities, which are linked to higher recidivism rates. Medium risk.\n\nDrug use: none in the past four years. That's good because substance abuse is a major factor in criminal behavior. Low risk.\n\nMental health: she feels down sometimes. While depression isn't directly predictive of rearrest, it can affect other areas like employment and relationships, which do impact recidivism. Medium risk.\n\nFamily background: grew up with biological mother in an urban household of four. Family stability is important. A stable upbringing might mitigate some risks. Low risk.\n\nReligious involvement: believes God influences her life. Religious affiliation has been shown to reduce recidivism by providing support and reducing engagement in risky behaviors. Medium risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, there are several high-risk factors like prior convictions, lack of education, and unemployment. However, she doesn't use drugs and has some mitigating factors like being female and having a stable upbringing. The confidence level is about 70% that she might be rearrested within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females have lower recidivism rates compared to males.\"),\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young individuals are at higher risk due to potential for risky behaviors.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a significant predictor of recidivism when other factors are controlled.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Two arrests and a conviction increase the likelihood of future offenses.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Average height and weight do not indicate particular risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Divorce and living alone can contribute to social isolation, increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is a strong predictor of criminal behavior and recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to stress and fewer positive activities, linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years reduces risk related to substance abuse.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down can affect other areas like employment and relationships, impacting recidivism.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with biological mother might mitigate some risks.\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"medium\", \"Belief in God can provide support and reduce risky behaviors.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
