    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21 years old. Studies show that younger individuals, especially in their early twenties, are more likely to engage in criminal behavior. However, as they get older and take on more responsibilities, the likelihood tends to decrease. So, being 21 isn't a huge red flag but still carries some risk.\n\nNext, gender is male. Statistically, men are more frequently arrested than women for various crimes. This factor contributes to higher recidivism rates in males compared to females. It's a significant point but not the only determinant.\n\nEthnicity as White might influence exposure to certain types of crime or law enforcement practices, but this isn't a direct indicator of recidivism. So, I'll rate this as low impact.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrests can sometimes lead to future legal issues even without conviction, but the lack of conviction lowers the risk slightly compared to someone with multiple convictions.\n\nMarital status is married and living with spouse. Marital stability often correlates with lower recidivism rates because it provides emotional support and a stable environment. This should be a protective factor.\n\nHeight and weight at 6'0\" and 135 lbs. These physical attributes don't directly relate to recidivism risk, so they're low impact factors.\n\nEducation level is high school diploma without college enrollment. Higher education can sometimes reduce recidivism by offering more opportunities, but not having a college degree isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own.\n\nEmployment history shows he held two jobs in the past year. Stable employment is associated with lower crime rates because it provides income and structure. So, this is another protective factor.\n\nNo drug use for four years. Substance abuse is linked to higher recidivism rates, so his abstinence from drugs reduces that risk significantly.\n\nNo depression symptoms in the past month. Mental health issues can increase criminal behavior if untreated, so this absence is positive.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in a household of six in an urban area. Family structure can influence behavior; having both parents present might provide better support and reduce risk factors associated with broken homes.\n\nReligious belief that God influences personal events. Religious involvement often correlates with lower crime rates due to moral guidelines and community support, making this another protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: several protective factors like being married, employed, no drug use or depression, stable family background, and religious beliefs. The risk factors include age, gender, one arrest without conviction, and urban upbringing. However, the protective factors seem to outweigh the risks here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"21 years old, which is a moderate age for recidivism but not overly high risk\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"male gender associated with higher arrest rates\"),\n     (\"ethnicity_white\", \"low\", \"no direct correlation to recidivism\"),\n     (\"arrest_conviction_history\", \"low\", \"one arrest without conviction, lower than multiple convictions\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"married and living with spouse reduces recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"not directly related to criminal behavior\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"high school diploma may impact opportunities but not a direct risk factor\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"stable employment can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"no drug use for four years significantly reduces risk\"),\n     (\"depression_symptoms\", \"high\", \"absence of symptoms lowers recidivism likelihood\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"growing up with both parents in an urban area, mixed impact\"),\n     (\"religious Belief\", \"high\", \"belief in God's influence may reduce criminal behavior\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
