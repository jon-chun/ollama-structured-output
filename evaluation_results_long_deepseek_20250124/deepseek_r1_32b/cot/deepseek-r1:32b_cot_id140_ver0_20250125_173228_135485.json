    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Young adults are generally at a higher risk because they might still be developing socially and economically. So, high risk here.\n\nHe's male, which statistically has been shown to correlate with higher recidivism rates compared to females. So another high.\n\nEthnicity is White. I know that race can influence interactions with the criminal justice system, but without more context on systemic factors affecting him specifically, it's medium.\n\nArrest count is 6 times and he's convicted. Multiple arrests and a conviction history are strong predictors of future recidivism. That's definitely high.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 154 lbs. These don't seem directly related to recidivism risk, so low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Unmarried status and living alone can sometimes indicate less social support, which might increase risk. So medium here.\n\nEducation level is no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of education is a known factor linked to higher recidivism because it limits opportunities. High risk.\n\nEmployed 2 jobs in the past year. Having employment can be protective, but only two jobs might indicate instability or limited job history. So medium risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, even if not severe, can increase legal issues and impair judgment. Medium risk.\n\nMental health: felt down for a period last month. Symptoms of depression can affect decision-making and behavior. High risk here.\n\nFamily background: grew up in an urban area with his biological mother in a household of five. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but family structure isn't clear if it's supportive or not. So medium.\n\nReligious belief: believes God affects his life. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against recidivism. Low risk here.\n\nPutting all these together, most factors are high (age, male, arrest count, education, mental health) and some are medium. The presence of several high-risk factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. I'm leaning towards predicting YES with confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age\", \"high\", \"22 years old falls in the high-risk category for recidivism due to younger age often associated with higher criminal activity rates.\"),\n     (\"Gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender is a significant predictor of higher recidivism rates compared to female counterparts.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"While race can influence interactions with the criminal justice system, without specific systemic factors affecting him, this is considered medium risk.\"),\n     (\"Arrest Count\", \"high\", \"Six prior arrests and a conviction history are strong indicators of potential future recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Height/Weight\", \"low\", \"Physical dimensions are not directly linked to recidivism risk and thus carry low weight.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate less social support, contributing moderately to risk.\"),\n     (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED limits opportunities and is a known factor in higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"Employment History\", \"medium\", \"Having held two jobs suggests some stability but also potential instability, making it a medium risk factor.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use\", \"medium\", \"Past marijuana use over the last four years can increase legal issues and impair judgment, posing moderate risk.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health\", \"high\", \"Reported feelings of depression are linked to impaired decision-making and higher recidivism potential.\"),\n     (\"Family Background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may influence exposure to crime but lacks clarity on family support structure.\"),\n     (\"Religious Belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can offer protective factors against recidivism through community support, thus low risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
