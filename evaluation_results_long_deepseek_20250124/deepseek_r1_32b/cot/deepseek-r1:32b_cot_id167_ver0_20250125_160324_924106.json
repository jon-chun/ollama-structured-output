    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adults are more likely to engage in risky behaviors because their brains are still developing, and they might not have the same level of self-control as older individuals. So I think age here is a medium risk factor.\n\nRace is White. From what I know, there's some variation in recidivism rates across different racial groups, but it's not the strongest predictor. It doesn't directly indicate higher or lower risk on its own, so maybe low impact.\n\nArrest history: he has been arrested once and convicted. A single conviction isn't as bad as multiple, but having any criminal record can increase the likelihood of future arrests. So I'm leaning towards medium here too.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'1\" and 155 lbs. That seems a bit underweight for his height. Maybe that's not directly related to recidivism unless it indicates some underlying issue, like substance abuse or mental health problems. Since he uses marijuana, perhaps the weight is relevant but I'm not sure how much impact it has. So maybe low.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Research shows that being in a stable relationship can lower recidivism rates. Living alone might mean less supervision or support, which could be a risk factor. So medium here.\n\nEducation level: he has a GED and is enrolled in college. Higher education usually correlates with lower recidivism because it offers more opportunities and instills structure. That's a positive sign, so low impact as a risk factor.\n\nEmployment status: no jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to financial stress and may increase the likelihood of criminal activity as a means to meet needs. This is a significant factor, so high.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance abuse, even if it's not hard drugs, can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing the chance of reoffending. Also, drug use can sometimes be linked to other crimes like theft to support the habit. So medium here.\n\nDepression: no depression in the past month. Mental health issues like depression can contribute to recidivism if left untreated, but since he's not currently depressed, this might lower his risk a bit. However, it's possible that undiagnosed or fluctuating mental health could still be a factor, so I'm unsure here. Maybe low.\n\nFamily background: lived with biological mother in a household of size 3 at a young age. Family dynamics can influence behavior, but without more information on the quality of that relationship, it's hard to assess. So probably low impact.\n\nReligious beliefs: he doesn't believe God affects his personal life. Some studies suggest that strong religious beliefs can act as a protective factor against recidivism because they provide a moral framework and support network. The absence of such beliefs might be a risk factor, but I'm not sure how significant it is compared to other factors like unemployment or education. So maybe low.\n\nPutting this all together: he has several moderate risks (age, arrest history, living alone, drug use) and some high ones (unemployment). His positive factors include education and not currently feeling depressed. The lack of employment seems particularly concerning because without a stable job, he might be more inclined to engage in criminal activities. The combination of unemployment, single conviction, and substance use suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest.\n\nI think the confidence should be around 70% because while there are several risk factors, some protective factors like education and not being depressed mitigate the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adults have higher tendencies for risky behavior due to brain development stages\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Single conviction increases likelihood but less than multiple offenses\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Height and weight may indicate underlying issues but no direct correlation\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone with no marital ties can reduce supervision and support\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Higher education correlates with lower recidivism due to opportunities and structure\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment leads to financial stress and potential engagement in criminal activities\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use can impair judgment and decision-making, increasing reoffending risk\"),\n     (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No current depression may lower recidivism risk but fluctuating mental health is a concern\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Family dynamics influence behavior but insufficient info on quality of relationships\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Absence of religious beliefs might lack protective factors against recidivism\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
