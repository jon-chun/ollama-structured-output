    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over the next three years. Let me go through each factor one by one and see what they might indicate.\n\nFirst, age is 21. From what I know, younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they're still developing emotionally and socially. Plus, they might not have as much life experience or stable support systems. So, being 21 could be a medium risk factor here.\n\nNext, gender is male. There's a significant body of research showing that males tend to have higher rates of arrest and recidivism compared to females. This isn't about making generalizations but recognizing statistical trends. So, this would probably be a high risk factor.\n\nRace is Black. I know there are systemic issues in the criminal justice system that disproportionately affect Black individuals, leading to higher arrest and conviction rates. However, when assessing individual risk, we have to consider other factors too. But given the context, it's still a medium risk factor because while race can be indicative of systemic issues, it doesn't solely determine recidivism.\n\nNumber of arrests is three times, with a conviction. More arrests typically correlate with higher recidivism rates. Having been convicted also means there's a history of offending behavior that has been judicially acknowledged. So, this would likely be a high risk factor.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'5\" and between 150-174 lbs. I don't think physical stature is directly linked to recidivism. Unless someone uses their size for criminal activity, which isn't indicated here, these factors probably aren't significant. So, low risk.\n\nNever married and living alone. Marital status can be a protective factor against recidivism because being in a stable relationship might provide support and accountability. Living alone could mean less supervision or social support, which might increase the risk. This seems like a medium factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is a strong predictor of recidivism. Without a diploma, job opportunities are limited, leading to higher chances of involvement in criminal activities out of necessity or lack of alternatives. So, this would be a high risk factor.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment can be both positive and negative here. On one hand, having jobs shows some level of responsibility and stability. But if he's only held two jobs in a year, it might indicate job instability, which could lead to issues with maintaining steady employment, affecting his ability to support himself legally. So, medium risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism. Active drug use can impair judgment, lead to criminal behavior to sustain habits, and create cycles of addiction that are hard to break without support. Recent use (past month) suggests ongoing issues, so high risk.\n\nMental health: felt down most days in the past month, nothing cheers him up. This indicates possible depression or other mental health issues. Poor mental health can contribute to criminal behavior as individuals might turn to substances or illegal activities as coping mechanisms. So, this is a high risk factor.\n\nUpbringing: lived with adoptive parents in an urban area, household size 3. Family environment plays a role, but without more specifics about the home dynamics (like abuse, neglect, or supportiveness), it's hard to assess. Urban areas might have higher crime rates and fewer resources, which could be influential but aren't directly causal. So, low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: God has nothing to do with personal events. Lack of religious affiliation isn't a direct indicator of recidivism. Some studies show that religion can provide a support system and moral framework, so the absence might slightly increase risk but not as strongly as other factors. Medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most of these factors point towards a higher likelihood of rearrest. The high-risk factors include being male, Black (considering systemic issues), three arrests with a conviction, no education, drug use, and mental health issues. Medium risks come from age, living alone, job instability, and religious beliefs. Low risks are physical stature and upbringing details.\n\nConsidering all these, my prediction is that this individual has a higher chance of being rearrested within the next three years. The confidence level isn't 100% because some factors like having jobs might slightly mitigate risk, but overall, the high-risk factors outweigh them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher recidivism rates due to developmental factors and lack of stability.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Statistical trends indicate males have higher arrest and recidivism rates compared to females.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic issues disproportionately affect Black individuals, though individual risk varies widely beyond race.\"),\n     (\"arrests_convictions\", \"high\", \"Three arrests with a conviction suggest a history of offending behavior linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"physical_stature\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not directly linked to recidivism without additional context or misuse of size.\"),\n     (\"marital_status_living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may indicate less social support, contributing to higher risk.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"high\", \"Lack of high school diploma limits job opportunities, increasing risk of criminal involvement for survival.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Holding two jobs shows some responsibility but also suggests instability which can affect legal support.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent and past drug use (marijuana and cocaine) indicates ongoing addiction issues linked to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Persistent feelings of depression suggest mental health issues that may lead to criminal behavior as coping mechanisms.\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing with adoptive parents lacks specific negative dynamics, so impact on recidivism is minimal.\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious affiliation might reduce access to support systems but isn't a direct indicator of recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
