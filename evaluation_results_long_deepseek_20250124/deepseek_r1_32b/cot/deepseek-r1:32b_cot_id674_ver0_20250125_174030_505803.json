    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's dive into this case. I'm evaluating a 21-year-old male with specific risk factors for rearrest recidivism over three years. First, his age is on the lower end of young adulthood. Typically, younger individuals are at higher risk due to impulsivity and lack of maturity, so that's a medium factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. Demographics can sometimes be predictive depending on social contexts, but in many cases, race isn't a strong standalone factor. I'll rate this low.\n\nHaving one arrest and conviction is significant. Past behavior often predicts future actions, so this gets a high weight. \n\nHis height and weight don\u2019t provide much predictive value here, so that's low.\n\nNever being married might indicate less stability or family support, which can be a risk. That's medium.\n\nLiving alone could mean fewer social supports, but it's not as strong a factor as other indicators, so I'll go with medium.\n\nA high school diploma is moderate in terms of protective factors. It shows some level of education, which can help, but he isn't enrolled in college, which might limit future opportunities. Medium again.\n\nHolding one job during the year suggests employment consistency, which is a positive sign. That's low risk.\n\nNo drug use in four years is definitely a protective factor. Drug use is often linked to recidivism, so this is low.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently also helps lower the risk since mental health issues can contribute to reoffending. Low here.\n\nLiving in a large household at a young age might indicate potential instability or lack of supervision, which could be a medium risk factor.\n\nHis belief in God suggests some level of personal responsibility and support from faith communities, which is protective. Low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, the strongest factors are his past conviction (high), being single (medium), living alone (medium), and having only one job (low). The protective factors include no drug use, mental health stability, religious belief, education, and current employment. Considering these, the likelihood of rearrest is low but not impossible. I'm fairly confident in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 21 falls into a higher-risk demographic for recidivism compared to older individuals.\"),\n     (\"race/ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a significant predictor of rearrest when other factors are considered.\"),\n     (\"prior arrests\", \"high\", \"One arrest and conviction indicate past behavior that correlates with higher risk of future offenses.\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height is not a predictive factor for rearrest.\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight is not a predictive factor for rearrest.\"),\n     (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married may reflect less stability or support, which can influence recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"living situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may indicate fewer social supports that could deter criminal activity.\"),\n     (\"education level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma is a moderate protective factor but not as strong as higher education.\"),\n     (\"employment history\", \"low\", \"Holding one job during the year suggests some stability, which is a protective factor.\"),\n     (\"drug use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years is a significant protective factor against rearrest.\"),\n     (\"mental health\", \"low\", \"No depression reported recently reduces risk compared to individuals with mental health issues.\"),\n     (\"household size during upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large household may reflect environmental factors that could influence behavior.\"),\n     (\"religious belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide personal accountability and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
