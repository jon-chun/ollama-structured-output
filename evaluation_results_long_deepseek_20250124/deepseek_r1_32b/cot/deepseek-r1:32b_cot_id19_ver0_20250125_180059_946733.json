    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to assess the risk of this individual rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 20. From what I know, younger individuals are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing decision-making skills and could be more influenced by peers or environmental factors. So age being low probably means it's a minor risk factor here.\n\nNext, gender: male. Studies have shown that males tend to have higher rates of arrest and recidivism compared to females. This isn't necessarily about inherent traits but could relate to societal roles, exposure to certain environments, etc. So this is a medium risk factor because while it's significant, it's not the highest.\n\nRace is white. I'm trying to recall if there are specific studies on how race affects recidivism. From what I remember, minority groups often face higher arrest rates and systemic issues that might contribute to recidivism. But for white individuals, especially in certain contexts, they might have different risk factors. However, without more context, it's a low factor because it doesn't directly correlate as much as others.\n\nNumber of arrests is four times, with a conviction. More prior arrests typically indicate higher risk because each arrest could reflect either increased offending or other underlying issues like substance abuse or lack of support systems. So this should be a high factor since multiple arrests are strong predictors of future recidivism.\n\nConviction status: he's been convicted, which is more serious than just being arrested. Convictions can lead to longer sentences and might indicate a pattern of behavior that's more likely to result in rearrest. High risk again because it shows a history of successfully processed criminal charges.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'6\" and 135 lbs. I don't see how these directly impact recidivism unless maybe they're underweight, which could indicate substance abuse or health issues. But without more info on health, this is low risk.\n\nMarital status: never married, living alone. Research suggests that having a stable relationship can reduce recidivism rates because of the support and accountability it provides. Being single and living alone might mean less supervision and fewer positive influences. So medium risk here.\n\nEducation level: high school diploma, not in college. Education is a protective factor; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism. Not being in college could limit job opportunities and increase exposure to negative influences. Medium risk because it's a moderate protective factor but he's not leveraging it further.\n\nEmployment history: five jobs in the past year. High job turnover can indicate instability, which might lead to financial stress or limited prospects. Unstable employment is linked with higher recidivism because individuals might resort to crime due to economic hardship or lack of legitimate opportunities. So high risk here.\n\nSubstance use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant factor because it can impair judgment, reduce self-control, and lead to criminal behavior to sustain drug habits. Past month feels down all the time\u2014depression could exacerbate substance use or other risky behaviors. High risk for both factors.\n\nFamily background: grew up with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family upbringing is generally protective, but living in urban areas might expose him to higher crime rates and more opportunities for criminal involvement. So low risk because of the stable family but medium due to urban environment? Wait, maybe I should split this into two factors if possible, but since it's one factor here, perhaps consider it as medium because while having both parents is protective, the urban area could introduce risks.\n\nReligious beliefs: doesn't think God influences his life. Lack of religious involvement can be a risk because faith communities often provide support and deter from criminal behavior. So low to medium? Maybe medium since some studies show that religiosity can be protective against recidivism.\n\nPutting it all together, the high-risk factors are number of arrests, conviction, substance use, and employment instability. Medium risks include gender, marital status, education, family background (urban area), and religious beliefs. Low risks are age, race, physical characteristics.\n\nConsidering all these, my prediction is that he has a higher chance of rearresting within three years. The confidence would be around 75% because while there are significant risk factors, some protective elements like having had parents might slightly mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"20-year-old may still be developing decision-making skills and influenced by peers.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher recidivism rates due to societal roles and environmental factors.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may face different systemic issues compared to minorities.\"),\n     (\"number_of_arrests\", \"high\", \"Four arrests indicate potential for future offending or underlying issues.\"),\n     (\"conviction_status\", \"high\", \"Convictions suggest a pattern of behavior leading to rearrest.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation with recidivism without health context.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may lack support and accountability.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma but not in college limits job opportunities.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"high\", \"Job instability can lead to financial stress and criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana and cocaine use impair judgment and increase risk of crime.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"Persistent depression may exacerbate substance use or risky behaviors.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing might expose to higher crime rates despite stable family.\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious involvement can reduce protective support.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
