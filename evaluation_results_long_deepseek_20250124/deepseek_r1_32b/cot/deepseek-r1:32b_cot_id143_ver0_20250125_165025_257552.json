    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this individual. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. From what I know, younger individuals, especially in their early twenties, are generally at a higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. However, since she's on the lower end of that spectrum and not a juvenile anymore, maybe the risk isn't extremely high here.\n\nShe's female. Research shows that women tend to have lower rearrest rates compared to men. So, this is probably a protective factor. It should weigh in as low or medium negative.\n\nHer race is White. I'm aware that there are disparities in the criminal justice system, but when it comes to recidivism, some studies suggest that Black individuals might be at higher risk due to systemic issues. But for White individuals, especially without a history of convictions, the risk might be lower than others, so this could be low.\n\nShe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Arrests can sometimes lead to overestimating recidivism because not everyone who is arrested goes on to commit another crime. Without a conviction, maybe this factor isn't as strong as it would be otherwise. So perhaps medium risk here.\n\nLiving alone without being married. I'm trying to recall if living situation affects recidivism. From what I remember, having a stable home environment and social support can lower the risk. Living alone might mean she doesn't have that support system, which could increase the risk. But since she's managing on her own and has a job history, maybe it's not as high.\n\nShe has a Bachelor's degree and isn't in college anymore. Education is usually a protective factor against recidivism because it can lead to better job opportunities and stability. Having completed a degree should lower her risk here.\n\nShe held four jobs in the past year. That seems like a lot of job changes, which could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment. High job turnover might be linked to higher recidivism rates as it can contribute to financial stress and other issues. So this is likely a medium to high risk factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and some depression symptoms recently. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism because drugs can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. Additionally, feeling down could indicate mental health issues that aren't being addressed, which can also contribute to higher risks. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. Stable upbringing is generally protective, but urban areas might have higher crime rates and more exposure to criminal activities. It's a bit mixed, so I'm leaning towards medium here.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her life. Spirituality can sometimes serve as a protective factor because it provides a sense of purpose and community support. Without that belief, she might lack certain coping mechanisms. So this could be a low or medium risk.\n\nPutting it all together: She has several factors that lower her risk (being female, educated) but also some significant ones that increase it (drug use, mental health symptoms, job instability). The drug and mental health issues are the biggest red flags here, so I think the prediction is YES for rearrest within three years with a high confidence level.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age: 22\", \"medium\", \"Individuals in their early twenties may still be developing socially and emotionally, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Gender: Female\", \"low\", \"Women generally have lower rearrest rates compared to men.\"),\n     (\"Race: White\", \"low\", \"Lower risk compared to other races due to systemic factors affecting others more severely.\"),\n     (\"Arrest history: 1 arrest, no conviction\", \"medium\", \"Arrests can indicate potential issues but lack of conviction reduces this factor's impact.\"),\n     (\"Living situation: Living alone, not married\", \"medium\", \"Potential lack of social support could increase risk, though she manages independently.\"),\n     (\"Education: Bachelor's degree\", \"low\", \"Educational attainment is a protective factor against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Employment history: 4 jobs in the past year\", \"medium\", \"High job turnover may indicate instability contributing to higher risk.\"),\n     (\"Drug use: Marijuana and cocaine past four years, recent depression symptoms\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse and mental health issues are significant predictors of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Upbringing: Urban area with both parents in a household of four\", \"medium\", \"Stable upbringing is protective but urban areas may expose to higher crime rates.\"),\n     (\"Religious belief: Doesn't believe God affects her life\", \"low\", \"Lack of spirituality might reduce coping mechanisms, increasing risk slightly.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}",
