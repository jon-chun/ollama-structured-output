Young people are generally more at risk because they might still be developing socially and economically. So that's a medium risk factor.\n\nHe identifies as Black. There's systemic bias in the criminal justice system which can lead to higher arrest rates, so this is a high risk factor.\n\nNine arrests and a conviction history indicate past problematic behavior. More prior convictions are linked to higher recidivism rates, so that's a high risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'1\" and 180 lbs. Physical size isn't directly related to criminal behavior, so low risk here.\n\nNever married and living alone can mean less social support, which might increase the likelihood of reoffending. That's a medium factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED suggests lower educational attainment, which is associated with higher crime rates. Medium risk.\n\nUnemployed for a year means limited stable income and opportunities, increasing chances of recidivism. High risk here.\n\nNo drug use in four years is positive; substance abuse is linked to crime, so low risk.\n\nNot feeling depressed recently reduces mental health-related risks, so low there.\n\nRaised in a large household (14 people) in an urban area might mean exposure to more stress or negative influences. Medium risk factor.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life could provide some moral guidance and support, which is protective. Low risk here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 19 falls into a higher-risk demographic for recidivism.\"),\n     (\"race_ethnicity\", \"high\", \"Black individuals face systemic biases increasing rearrest likelihood.\"),\n     (\"prior_convictions\", \"high\", \"Nine arrests and a conviction history indicate high risk of reoffending.\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight not directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone may reduce social support, increasing risk.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of diploma or GED is associated with higher crime rates.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for a year indicates limited opportunities, raising recidivism chances.\"),\n     (\"substance_abuse\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years suggests reduced substance-related risks.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed recently lowers mental health-linked risks.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Large household and urban upbringing may expose to stress or negative influences.\"),\n     (\"religious_views\", \"low\", \"Belief in God could offer protective moral support.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
