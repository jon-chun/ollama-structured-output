    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual. She's a 21-year-old White female with some specific background details. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is usually a big factor in recidivism. Younger individuals are often more at risk because they might still be developing emotionally and socially. At 21, she's on the lower end of that spectrum, so I think her age would contribute to a medium risk here.\n\nNext, gender. Statistically, males have higher rearrest rates than females. Since she's female, this should lower her risk. So, gender is probably a low-risk factor.\n\nHer race is White. From what I know, some studies show that minority groups might face more systemic issues leading to higher arrest rates, but in her case, being White doesn't necessarily mean lower risk unless there are specific factors at play. Maybe it's neutral, so I'll mark this as low.\n\nMarital status can be protective. Being married often correlates with stability and support systems, which can reduce recidivism. She's married and living with her spouse, so that should count as a low-risk factor.\n\nEducation is another key area. Without a high school diploma or GED, she might face challenges in finding stable employment. This could increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity out of necessity. So, education would be a medium risk.\n\nEmployment status also ties into this. She hasn't held any jobs in the past year, which can lead to idleness and potential involvement in negative activities. That's another medium-risk factor.\n\nDrug use, specifically marijuana over the past four years, is relevant. Substance abuse can impair judgment and increase the chances of reoffending. Even though it's not a hard drug, consistent use is still a concern. I'll rate this as medium risk.\n\nMental health here isn't an issue since she hasn't felt depressed recently. That's a positive sign, so mental health is low risk.\n\nFamily structure growing up was stable with both parents in a rural area. Stable family backgrounds are protective against recidivism, so that's another low-risk factor.\n\nHer religious beliefs might provide a sense of purpose and community support, which can be protective. So, spirituality is also a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: She has medium risks from age, education, employment, and drug use. The other factors are low risk. Considering these, the prediction leans towards rearrest being likely, but not extremely so. My confidence isn't super high because there are protective factors like marriage and family stability that might mitigate some risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young age is associated with higher risk of recidivism\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females have lower rearrest rates compared to males\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White individuals may have different systemic experiences but not necessarily higher risk in this context\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Being married is a protective factor against recidivism\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lack of high school diploma or GED can limit opportunities and increase risk\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployed individuals may have higher risk due to lack of stable income\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Past drug use, even marijuana, can be associated with recidivism\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No recent depression symptoms suggest lower mental health risks\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both parents in a stable environment is protective\"),\n     (\"spirituality\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide a protective factor through community and purpose\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
