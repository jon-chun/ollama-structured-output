    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to help assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old Black female with certain characteristics. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Typically, younger individuals are at higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. So I'd rate this as medium.\n\nShe's female. Research shows that females generally have lower rearrest rates compared to males, so this would be a low-risk factor.\n\nHer race is Black. There's unfortunately systemic bias in the criminal justice system which can lead to higher surveillance and arrest rates for Black individuals. This makes it a high-risk factor.\n\nShe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests without convictions might indicate some level of involvement in illegal activities, even if not proven. So I'd consider this medium risk.\n\nHer height is 5'7\". Height doesn't really correlate with recidivism rates, so that's low risk.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living arrangements can impact stability. Being single and alone might mean less social support, which could be a moderate risk factor.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Educational attainment is linked to lower recidivism rates. Lack of education is a significant concern, so I'd mark this as high risk.\n\nNo jobs in the past year. Employment is a protective factor against recidivism. Unemployment can increase the likelihood of rearrest, making this a medium-risk factor.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years. Substance use can lead to criminal behavior and legal issues, so this is another high-risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health plays a role; since she's not depressed, that's lower risk.\n\nGrew up with her biological mother in a household of two. Family structure can influence outcomes. A stable family environment might be protective, but without more info, I'll consider it low risk.\n\nBelieves God has a role in her life. Religious involvement often correlates with lower recidivism, so this is a low-risk factor.\n\nPutting all these together: high risks from race, education, drug use; medium from age, arrests, unemployment; and some protective factors like gender, mental health, religion. The overall prediction leans towards rearrest, but there are mitigating factors, so confidence isn't extremely high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 22 is associated with higher risk due to ongoing development\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females have lower rearrest rates compared to males\"),\n     (\"race\", \"high\", \"Systemic biases increase surveillance and arrest rates for Black individuals\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without convictions suggest potential involvement in illegal activities\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height does not correlate with recidivism risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support, increasing risk\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education is linked to higher rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can increase likelihood of rearrest\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance use may lead to criminal behavior and legal issues\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month suggests lower mental health risk\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Growing up with biological mother in a stable household is protective\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may correlate with lower recidivism rates\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
