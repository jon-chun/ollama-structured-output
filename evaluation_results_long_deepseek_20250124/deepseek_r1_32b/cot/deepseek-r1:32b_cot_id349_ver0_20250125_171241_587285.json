    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this 22-year-old male. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age. He's 22, which is relatively young. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might engage in more impulsive behaviors. So I'd say medium risk here.\n\nNext, gender. He's male, and males are generally overrepresented in the criminal justice system compared to females. That makes this a high-risk factor.\n\nRace is White. While race alone isn't a predictor of recidivism, it can interact with other factors like systemic biases or socioeconomic status. I'll rate this as low risk because it doesn't directly indicate higher likelihood but might have some indirect effects.\n\nNumber of prior arrests: He's been arrested once and convicted. Having a conviction history is a significant factor. Even one arrest can influence future behavior, so this should be medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight don't typically correlate with recidivism, so I'll mark these as low risk.\n\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. Living alone might reduce supervision and support, which could increase the likelihood of rearrest. This is a medium factor.\n\nEducation level: He has a high school diploma and is in college. Higher education generally reduces recidivism by providing better opportunities. So this is low risk.\n\nEmployment status: No jobs in the past year. Unemployment can lead to increased criminal activity due to lack of stable income or structure. That's medium risk.\n\nDrug use: Marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if not hard drugs, can be linked to other criminal behaviors and dependencies. Medium risk here.\n\nDepression: None in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with recidivism, but since he isn't depressed, this is low risk.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both parents in a household of six in an urban area. Stable family environment usually lowers recidivism, so low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believes God has a role in his life. Religious involvement can provide support and reduce criminal behavior. Low risk here.\n\nPutting it all together, the factors that stand out are gender (high), prior arrest/conviction (medium), living alone/unemployed (both medium). While some factors are low or mitigating, the high-risk factors like gender and a conviction history increase the likelihood of rearrest. I think there's a moderate confidence level in predicting rearrest as YES.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 22 is relatively young, which can be associated with higher recidivism rates due to developmental factors.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender is a significant risk factor for rearrest due to overrepresentation in the criminal justice system.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race alone does not directly indicate higher risk but may interact with systemic factors.\"),\n     (\"prior_arrests\", \"medium\", \"One prior arrest and conviction history can influence future behavior.\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height is unrelated to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"weight\", \"low\", \"Weight does not typically correlate with rearrest likelihood.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce supervision, potentially increasing rearrest risk.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"College enrollment suggests higher education reducing recidivism chances.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can lead to criminal activity due to lack of stable income or structure.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use may correlate with other behaviors linked to rearrest.\"),\n     (\"depression\", \"low\", \"No recent depression reduces likelihood of associated risk factors.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Stable family environment can lower recidivism chances.\"),\n     (\"religious_beliefs\", \"low\", \"Belief in God might provide support reducing criminal behavior.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
