    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this individual. Let me start by going through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. I know that younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism because they're still developing and might not have stable life circumstances yet. So, I think age here would be a high risk factor.\n\nNext, gender is male. Statistically, males tend to have higher rates of rearrest compared to females. This doesn't mean all males will reoffend, but it's a notable factor. So, I'd rate this as medium.\n\nRace identified as Black. There are systemic issues that lead to overrepresentation in the criminal justice system for Black individuals. This is a significant factor, so I'll mark race as high.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted once. A history of arrests and convictions usually increases recidivism risk because it shows past behavior leading to reoffending. So, arrest history is definitely high.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'10\" and 150-174 lbs. I don't see how this directly affects rearrest rates, so this would be low.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living arrangements can impact recidivism; being single and without a support system might contribute to higher risk. So, marital status and living situation are both medium factors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Education level is important because lower education often correlates with higher crime rates due to limited opportunities. This would be a high factor.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment can be protective against recidivism if stable. Having some job history might indicate some stability but only two jobs could mean instability, so I'll rate this as medium.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of rearrest because it can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior. This is definitely high.\n\nDepression symptoms: felt down in the dumps in the past month. Mental health issues like depression are linked to higher recidivism rates as they can affect decision-making and social functioning. So, mental health is medium.\n\nUpbringing: lived with biological mother in a household of four. Family dynamics play a role; if there were issues or instability, it could impact behavior. But since we don't have more details, I'll consider this low.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes be protective against recidivism by providing support and purpose. So, religious affiliation is low.\n\nPutting all these together, most of the factors are medium or high, which suggests a higher risk for rearrest. The confidence level is moderately high but not extremely so because some factors are only medium.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Young age increases recidivism likelihood due to developmental stage.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have higher rearrest rates, though it's not absolute.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"high\", \"Systemic factors contribute to higher representation in criminal justice for Black individuals.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"Past arrests and convictions indicate a pattern of behavior linked to recidivism.\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes don't directly correlate with rearrest risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Single status without support systems can increase risk.\"),\n     (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social supports, affecting stability.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education correlates with limited opportunities and higher crime rates.\"),\n     (\"employment_history\", \"medium\", \"Two jobs might indicate instability or part-time work affecting support.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse can impair judgment and lead to criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Depression symptoms can affect decision-making and social functioning.\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"low\", \"Details about family dynamics are insufficient for assessment.\"),\n     (\"religious_affiliation\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
