    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. I remember that younger individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and might be more involved in risky behaviors. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nNext, gender is male. Studies show that males are more likely to be rearrested than females, so this should probably be a high factor.\n\nHispanic ethnicity... I'm not sure how significant this is compared to other factors like socioeconomic status or criminal history. It might be low unless there's something specific about Hispanic populations in the area he lives in, but I don't have that info, so low for now.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's interesting because an arrest without a conviction could indicate either that he was innocent or that the charges were dropped for some reason. It might be a medium factor since it shows some involvement with the law but no conviction history to go on.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'9\" and 130 lbs. I don't recall these being significant predictors of recidivism, so low here.\n\nNever married and not living alone. Being single can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there's less stability, but it's not a strong factor. Maybe medium because living arrangements might indicate some level of social support or lack thereof.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education is usually protective against recidivism. Having a diploma is good, so low risk here.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is a protective factor. Consistent work can reduce the likelihood of rearrest, so medium because it's positive but he only had one job, which might indicate some instability.\n\nNo drug use in four years and not depressed recently. Both are strong protective factors. Substance abuse is linked to higher crime rates, so no use is low risk. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior if untreated, but since he's not feeling depressed, that's also low.\n\nGrew up with biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Family structure and environment matter. A larger household might mean more supervision or could be a negative if there was conflict. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, which can influence behavior. I'm leaning towards medium because family dynamics can be complex, but the presence of both parents is generally protective.\n\nConsiders God as influential in his life. Religious involvement often correlates with lower recidivism because it provides structure and support. So this should be low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: most factors are low or medium, with gender being high. The protective factors like education, employment, no substance use, religious beliefs, and not feeling depressed seem to outweigh the risks. So I'm predicting a lower chance of rearrest, maybe around 30% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Individual is young (20 years old), which may increase risk due to developmental factors and potential for impulsive behavior.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"high\", \"Male gender associated with higher recidivism rates compared to female.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity, but no specific indication of heightened risk without additional context such as socioeconomic factors or community dynamics.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction suggests potential legal involvement without a definitive criminal record.\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight are not significant predictors of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and currently not living alone may indicate some level of social instability or lack of protective factors such as spousal support.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma is a protective factor, as education can reduce recidivism risk by providing opportunities for stable employment.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Held one job during the year indicates some level of work consistency but may suggest limited job history or stability which could affect future prospects and thus influence behavior.\"),\n     (\"drug_usage\", \"low\", \"No drug use in past four years is a strong protective factor, as substance abuse is often linked to higher crime rates.\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed over the past month suggests good mental health, which can be protective against criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Grew up with biological mother in a household of size six in an urban area.
