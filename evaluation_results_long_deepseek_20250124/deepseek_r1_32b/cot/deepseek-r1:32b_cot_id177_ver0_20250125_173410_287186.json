    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out the risk assessment for this individual. He's an 18-year-old Black male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, his age is low risk because he's young and hasn't had much time in the criminal justice system yet. Younger individuals often have more opportunities for change and intervention.\n\nHe identifies as Black, which I know can be a risk factor due to systemic issues and higher arrest rates. So that would be medium risk here.\n\nHis arrest history is just one arrest without conviction, so that's low risk compared to multiple convictions or arrests.\n\nHe\u2019s 6 feet tall, but height alone doesn\u2019t really indicate risk level. So that's low risk.\n\nNot being married and living alone could be a factor since lack of stable relationships might contribute to higher risk. That would be medium risk because it's more about social support than anything else.\n\nEnrolled in school is definitely positive; education can reduce recidivism. So, that's a low risk factor.\n\nNo jobs in the past year might increase his risk because unemployment can lead to involvement in crime as an alternative means of income. That's medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in four years, which is good, but he has some mental health issues like feeling down. Mental health struggles can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism if not managed properly. So that's a medium risk factor.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area might present more challenges or influences that could contribute to criminal behavior, so that's another medium risk.\n\nHe believes in God, which is often associated with positive outcomes and lower recidivism rates because of the support from faith communities and personal accountability. That\u2019s low risk.\n\nPutting it all together, most factors are either low or medium. The arrest history, education, and belief in God are protective factors. The race, living alone, unemployment, mental health, and urban upbringing are moderate risks. Considering all these, I think the likelihood of rearrest is lower than higher, but there's still some risk present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"Young age with limited criminal history suggests low risk.\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Systemic factors may influence higher arrest rates for Black individuals.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"Single arrest without conviction indicates lower risk compared to multiple convictions.\"),\n     (\"height\", \"low\", \"Height does not correlate directly with recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Living alone and never married may indicate less social support, a moderate risk factor.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"Current enrollment in school is protective against rearrest.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment for the past year could increase recidivism risk without stable income.\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"No drug use in four years suggests low risk, though recent mental health issues may complicate this.\"),\n     (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might reduce supervision and increase risk of engagement in criminal activities.\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"Recent feelings of depression could influence behavior and recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing may present environmental challenges that contribute to higher risk.\"),\n     (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can provide support and reduce recidivism likelihood.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
