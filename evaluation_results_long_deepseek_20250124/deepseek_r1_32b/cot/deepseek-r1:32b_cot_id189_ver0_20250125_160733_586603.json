    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's potential rearrest within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 19. Younger individuals are generally at a higher risk because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. So, I'll mark this as medium.\n\nHe's male. Statistically, males have higher arrest rates than females. That's another medium factor.\n\nHis ethnicity is Hispanic. There can be systemic factors affecting arrest rates, so that's a low to medium concern. I'll go with low here because while it's a consideration, it's not the strongest predictor.\n\nNo prior convictions despite two arrests. This suggests he hasn't been formally charged or found guilty before, which might indicate lower risk. So, this is a low factor.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships can reduce recidivism risk. That's definitely a protective factor, so it's a high positive here.\n\nNo current job but has a high school diploma. Unemployment can sometimes be linked to higher crime rates, especially if someone feels they don't have opportunities. But he did finish high school, which is a plus. I'll rate this as low because education can mitigate some risks even without employment.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can increase legal issues and impulsivity. Since it's not severe substance abuse but still a factor, I'll mark this as medium.\n\nNo recent depression symptoms. Mental health plays a role, so no depression is positive. That's a low risk factor.\n\nRaised by both parents in a household of six in an urban area. Family stability can be protective, though living in an urban area might have higher crime rates. Overall, family support seems strong, so this is a low concern.\n\nBelieves God has a role in his life. Religious involvement can provide support and reduce recidivism. That's another protective factor, so high positive here.\n\nPutting it all together: he has several protective factors like marriage, family stability, religion, and education. The medium risks are age, gender, drug use, but the positives might outweigh these. So, I think his risk is low for rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"19 years old is a young adult, which is typically associated with higher risk of recidivism compared to older adults.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Male gender is correlated with higher rates of criminal behavior and rearrest compared to female gender.\"),\n     (\"ethnicity\", \"low\", \"Hispanic ethnicity may be associated with systemic factors that could influence arrest rates, but this factor alone does not strongly predict recidivism.\"),\n     (\"prior_convictions\", \"low\", \"No prior convictions despite two arrests suggests a lower likelihood of formal adjudication and thus a reduced risk compared to individuals with multiple convictions.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"high\", \"Being married is a strong protective factor against recidivism, as it often indicates stronger social ties and responsibilities that may deter criminal behavior.\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"No current job but having a high school diploma suggests some educational attainment which can be protective.
