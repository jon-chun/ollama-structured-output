    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old male within three years. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 22. From what I know, younger individuals are generally at higher risk for recidivism because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. So, high weight here.\n\nNext, gender is male. Studies show that males have higher rates of rearrest compared to females, so this is a medium factor. It's significant but not as impactful as age.\n\nHe identifies as White. Racial factors can influence outcomes due to systemic issues, but in risk assessment, race alone isn't the strongest predictor. So low weight here.\n\nArrest history: one arrest and conviction. Having any criminal history increases risk, but since it's only once, it's a medium factor. More history would be higher.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'10\" and 165 lbs. Physical characteristics don't directly correlate with recidivism, so low impact here.\n\nMarital status: never married and living alone. Lack of stable relationships can be a risk factor because support systems might be lacking. Medium weight.\n\nEducation is high school diploma, not in college. Lower education levels can limit opportunities, increasing the chance of involvement in crime. So medium here as well.\n\nEmployment: held three jobs in a year. Frequent job changes could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which is a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use: none in past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor, but since he hasn't used drugs recently, this is low.\n\nDepression: no feelings over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so absence here is low impact.\n\nUpbringing: lived with biological mother in a rural area. Family structure and environment matter. Stable upbringing might lower risk, so medium weight.\n\nReligious belief: considers God influential. Studies suggest that religious affiliation can reduce criminal behavior by providing moral framework. So this is a high protective factor.\n\nNow, considering all these factors: age (high), gender (medium), arrest history (medium), living alone (medium), education (medium), job changes (medium), rural upbringing (medium). The protective factors are lack of drug use and religious belief.\n\nOverall, the individual has several medium risk factors but also some protective ones. I think the likelihood is moderate for rearrest, so prediction is YES with a confidence around 65%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"high\", \"Individuals aged 22 are generally at higher risk for recidivism due to ongoing development stages.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"Males have statistically higher rearrest rates compared to females, though this varies by context.\"),\n     (\"race/ethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals may face systemic factors but race alone isn't the strongest predictor of recidivism.\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and conviction indicate some propensity for reoffending but not as strong as multiple offenses.\"),\n     (\"physical_attributes\", \"low\", \"Height and weight do not directly correlate with rearrest risk.\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"Never married and living alone can reflect a lack of social support networks, increasing risk.\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"High school diploma without college may limit opportunities, potentially affecting recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes suggest potential instability which could be a risk factor.\"),\n     (\"drug_use_history\", \"low\", \"No drug use in the past four years significantly reduces this risk factor.\"),\n     (\"mental_health_status\", \"low\", \"No recent depression symptoms lower the associated mental health risks.\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Rural upbringing with biological mother provides some stability but may also limit resources.\"),\n     (\"religious_affiliation\", \"high\", \"Belief in God can provide a protective factor against recidivism through moral framework.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
