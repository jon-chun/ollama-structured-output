    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of rearrest recidivism for this individual over three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is a big factor. She's 19, which is young. Young people are more likely to be involved in criminal activities because they might still be developing socially and emotionally. So I'll mark age as medium risk because while she's not extremely young, being in her late teens does pose some risk.\n\nNext, gender. She identifies as female. Historically, females have lower rates of recidivism compared to males. That makes sense because societal roles often differ, and women might be less likely to engage in certain types of crimes. So I'll rate this as low risk.\n\nRace is another factor here. She's Black. Unfortunately, there's a lot of systemic issues that can affect Black individuals more harshly in the criminal justice system. This could lead to higher surveillance or bias, which might increase their chances of rearrest. But it's not a direct cause of recidivism itself; rather, it's an external factor influencing their experience. So I'll give this a medium risk rating.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. Arrests can sometimes indicate potential issues, even without a conviction. However, since there's no conviction, the evidence might not be strong enough for a prior offense. Still, it's something to consider. I'll mark this as low because it's just one arrest with no conviction.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'5\" and 145 lbs. These are average stats, so they don't really indicate any risk factors. They're neutral, so I'll rate them low.\n\nMarital status: she's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes mean less social support, which might increase the risk of engaging in risky behaviors or not having someone to help her stay on track. So this gets a medium risk rating because lack of marital ties and living alone could be contributing factors.\n\nEducation level: no high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Low education is often linked with higher crime rates because it can limit job opportunities and lead to frustration or desperation. This seems like a significant factor, so I'll mark this as high risk.\n\nEmployment history: she's held three jobs in the past year. That might indicate instability in her work life. Frequent job changes could be a sign of difficulty maintaining employment, which is another risk factor for recidivism. So I'll rate this medium because while it shows some instability, it's not as severe as having no job at all.\n\nDrug use: she used marijuana in the past four years and has been feeling down in the dumps recently. Marijuana isn't as severe as harder drugs, but substance use can still impact judgment and behavior. Plus, feeling depressed could lead to more drug use or other negative behaviors. I'll mark this as medium risk because it's a moderate factor.\n\nHousehold size when young: she grew up in a household of five. Family dynamics can play a role, but without more info on the environment, it's hard to assess. However, living in a larger family might mean less attention per child or other stressors. I'll give this a low risk rating because it's not directly indicative.\n\nReligious belief: she believes God has a role in her life. Studies have shown that having religious beliefs can sometimes lower crime rates as people feel accountable and have moral guidelines. So this is a protective factor, which I'll rate as low risk but note it positively.\n\nPutting it all together: several medium factors like age, race, living alone, education, employment, drug use. The high risk from education is significant. While there are some protective factors like gender and religion, the combination of these risks suggests she might have a higher chance of rearrest. I'll predict a YES with about 65% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 19 is young, associated with higher risk due to developmental factors.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females have historically lower recidivism rates than males.\"),\n     (\"race/ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic issues affecting their criminal justice experience.\"),\n     (\"prior arrests\", \"low\", \"One arrest without conviction indicates potential but not confirmed issues.\"),\n     (\"height and weight\", \"low\", \"Average stats; no direct risk factors indicated.\"),\n     (\"marital status\", \"medium\", \"Never married, living alone may reduce social support.\"),\n     (\"education level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED can limit opportunities, increasing risk.\"),\n     (\"employment history\", \"medium\", \"Three jobs in a year suggest employment instability.\"),\n     (\"drug use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use and recent depression could influence behavior.\"),\n     (\"household size during youth\", \"low\", \"Upbringing in a household of five; impact unclear without more info.\"),\n     (\"religious belief\", \"low\", \"Belief in God may provide moral guidelines, reducing risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
