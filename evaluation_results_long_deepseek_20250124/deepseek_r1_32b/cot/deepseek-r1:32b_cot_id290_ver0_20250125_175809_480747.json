    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old Black female within three years based on the provided information. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, her age is 22. Typically, younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may not have stable life circumstances yet. So I'd rate this as medium risk.\n\nShe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. Past arrests can sometimes indicate a propensity towards criminal behavior, even without a conviction. This should probably be medium as well, considering she's only had one arrest.\n\nHer education level is a GED, and she's not enrolled in college. Lack of higher education can limit job opportunities, potentially increasing the risk of involvement in crime. So I think this is a high-risk factor.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a significant predictor of recidivism because it limits legitimate income sources and can lead to desperation. This should definitely be a high-risk factor.\n\nDrug use in the past four years, specifically marijuana, is another concern. Substance use can impair judgment and increase involvement in illegal activities, especially if seeking drugs leads to other crimes. I'll mark this as medium risk.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes lead to criminal behavior, but since she's not currently experiencing this, it might be low risk. However, a lack of mental health support could still pose a risk, so maybe medium? Hmm, I think the absence of current symptoms leans towards lower risk.\n\nShe has never been married and isn't living alone. Living with others can provide some social support but might also mean less personal responsibility or more influence from peers. This is a bit tricky. Maybe low to medium. I'll go with low since she's not isolated.\n\nAt a young age, she lived in an urban area with her biological mother in a household of four. Growing up in an urban environment can expose someone to higher crime rates and fewer opportunities. So this should be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personal events. Religious involvement is often associated with lower recidivism because it provides a moral framework and support network. This is a positive factor, so low risk.\n\nPutting it all together: She has several high-risk factors like lack of education and unemployment, but also some protective factors like religious beliefs and no current depression. The medium factors include age, past arrest, urban upbringing, and drug use.\n\nConsidering the balance, I think there's a moderate likelihood of rearrest within three years. Maybe around 65% confidence because while she has significant risks, there are mitigating factors too.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"At 22, she is in a high-risk age range for recidivism\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"One arrest but no conviction indicates potential risk without a definitive record\"),\n     (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Having only a GED and not pursuing higher education limits opportunities\"),\n     (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployed for the past year increases vulnerability to recidivism\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Marijuana use in the past four years can impair judgment and lead to further involvement\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression symptoms recently, though support systems are unclear\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Never married and not living alone provides some social context but limited stability\"),\n     (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing with biological mother in a household of four may expose to crime influences\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"low\", \"Belief in God can offer support and reduce recidivism risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
