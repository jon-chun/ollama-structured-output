    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for a 20-year-old female. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing and may not have stable circumstances yet. So, I'll mark this as medium risk.\n\nNext, gender: she's female. Generally, females have lower recidivism rates than males, so low risk here.\n\nRace/ethnicity is White. This factor doesn't typically show strong correlation with recidivism, so low risk.\n\nArrest history: one arrest and a conviction. Having any criminal record can increase the likelihood of rearrest, especially if there's a conviction. Medium risk.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'1\" and 110 lbs. These physical factors don't directly impact recidivism, so low risk.\n\nMarital status: never married, not living alone. Being single might contribute to instability, but she's not living alone which could be protective. I'll consider this medium as it has some influence.\n\nEducation: high school diploma and in college. Higher education is a protective factor against recidivism, so low risk here.\n\nEmployment: held three jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can indicate instability or issues with maintaining employment, which might be a medium risk factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant predictor of recidivism because it affects judgment and behavior. High risk here.\n\nMental health: felt down in the dumps for some time in the past month. Depression or low mood can impair decision-making and increase involvement in crime, so medium risk.\n\nFamily background: lived with both parents in an urban area. Stable family upbringing is protective, so low risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: considers God irrelevant to her life. Lack of religious involvement isn't strongly linked to recidivism, but it's a factor that might not provide additional support, so low risk.\n\nPutting all these together, the highest risks are drug use and arrest history, along with mental health. These factors suggest a moderate likelihood of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Age 20 is associated with higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development.\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"low\", \"Females generally have lower rearrest rates compared to males.\"),\n     (\"raceethnicity\", \"low\", \"White individuals show no strong correlation with recidivism trends.\"),\n     (\"arresthistory\", \"medium\", \"One arrest and a conviction can increase the likelihood of future arrests.\"),\n     (\"heightweight\", \"low\", \"Physical measurements don't directly correlate with rearrest risk.\"),\n     (\"maritalstatus\", \"medium\", \"Never married and not living alone may indicate some instability.\"),\n     (\"education\", \"low\", \"Higher education is protective against recidivism.\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"Frequent job changes suggest potential instability.\"),\n     (\"druguse\", \"high\", \"Substance abuse significantly predicts rearrest due to impaired judgment.\"),\n     (\"mentalhealth\", \"medium\", \"Depression can affect decision-making and increase criminal involvement risk.\"),\n     (\"familybackground\", \"low\", \"Stable upbringing with both parents is protective.\"),\n     (\"religiousbeliefs\", \"low\", \"Lack of religious involvement doesn't strongly predict recidivism.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
