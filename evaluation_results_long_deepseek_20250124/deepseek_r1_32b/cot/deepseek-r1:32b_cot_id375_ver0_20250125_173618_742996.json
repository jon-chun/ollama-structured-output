    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest within three years for this individual. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adults are often still developing socially and might be more prone to engaging in risky behaviors. So, low risk because he's just entering adulthood but not extremely young.\n\nNext, gender is male. Statistically, males have higher rearrest rates than females, especially in certain crimes. That\u2019s a medium factor because while it's significant, other factors can influence this.\n\nRace is White. There isn't as strong an association with race for rearrest as there might be for other demographics, but systemic issues could play a role. Low impact here.\n\nArrest history: three times and convicted. Having prior convictions increases the likelihood of recidivism. That's medium because while it shows some past issues, it's not excessively high.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'11\" and 135 lbs. No immediate correlation with rearrest risk, so low.\n\nNever married and currently not living alone. Not being in a committed relationship can sometimes be linked to higher risks, but this isn't always the case. Medium because living arrangements might affect stability.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED. Educational attainment is inversely related to recidivism; lower education often means fewer opportunities. High impact here as it's a significant risk factor.\n\nNot enrolled in college. Continuing education can reduce recidivism, so not being in school adds to the risk. Medium because while important, other factors might have more influence.\n\nHeld three jobs in a year. Job stability is key; frequent job changes can indicate instability or difficulties maintaining employment, which relates to higher crime rates. High impact because consistent work is protective against recidivism.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in past four years. Substance use, even if not severe, can increase the likelihood of rearrest. Medium as it's a moderate factor without more details on usage patterns.\n\nNot depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can lead to higher recidivism, but since he isn't currently depressed, this is low risk.\n\nRaised by biological mother in an urban area with household size 2. Family structure and environment play roles; being raised by a single parent might contribute, but it's not a direct indicator of rearrest risk. Medium because family dynamics can influence behavior without being the sole factor.\n\nBelieves God influences his life. Religious involvement is protective against recidivism as it often provides support structures. Low impact since while beneficial, other factors have more weight.\n\nPutting this all together: the high-risk factors are lack of education and unstable employment. These significantly contribute to higher rearrest rates. The medium factors include gender, arrest history, living situation, job changes, drug use, and family background. Considering these, the prediction leans towards a higher risk of rearrest. Confidence is around 75% because while there are multiple indicators, some protective factors like his religious beliefs might mitigate the risk slightly.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"21-year-old male, young adulthood, lower risk compared to younger or older individuals\"),\n     (\"gender\", \"medium\", \"male gender associated with higher rearrest rates\"),\n     (\"race\", \"low\", \"White race not a strong predictor of rearrest\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"medium\", \"three arrests and conviction history increases recidivism likelihood\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"5'11\\\" 135 lbs, no direct correlation with rearrest risk\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married, not living alone may affect stability\"),\n     (\"education\", \"high\", \"lack of high school diploma or GED linked to higher recidivism\"),\n     (\"college_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"not enrolled in college reduces protective factors\"),\n     (\"employment_stability\", \"high\", \"three jobs in a year indicates instability, higher risk\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"marijuana use past four years increases likelihood\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no depression past month, lower mental health risk\"),\n     (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"raised by mother in urban area, single-parent household impact\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"low\", \"believes God influences life, protective factor\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}",
