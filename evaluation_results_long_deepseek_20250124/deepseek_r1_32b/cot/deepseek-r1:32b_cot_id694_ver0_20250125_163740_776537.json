    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk of this individual rearresting within three years. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, gender is male. Studies show that males are more likely to be involved in criminal activities compared to females. So, this should be a high-risk factor.\n\nAge at first arrest was 19. Typically, younger individuals might still be developing, so an earlier first offense could indicate higher risk. But since he's already 19, maybe it's not as severe as someone who started much younger. I'll rate this medium.\n\nHe has three prior arrests and one conviction. More arrests usually mean higher recidivism rates. So, high risk here.\n\nHis ethnicity is White. In some studies, race can be a factor, but it's less direct than other factors like socioeconomic status. Maybe low or medium? I think the impact might be lower compared to others, so I'll go with low.\n\nHeight and weight are 6'0\" and 180 lbs. These are average stats and don't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so low risk.\n\nNever married and living alone. Unstable living situations can contribute to recidivism. Medium risk because being single isn't the highest factor, but living alone could pose challenges.\n\nHigh school diploma and not in college. Education level is a moderate factor; some studies show lower education correlates with higher crime rates. So medium.\n\nHe held seven jobs in a year. Job instability is a strong indicator of recidivism. High risk here because frequent job changes can lead to financial stress and involvement in criminal activities.\n\nDrug use within the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Drug abuse significantly increases the likelihood of rearrest, so high risk.\n\nMental health issues: he's felt down in the past month. Mental health struggles are linked to recidivism. Medium risk because it's recent but not chronic.\n\nGrowing up with both parents in an urban area. Family structure is protective, so low risk here.\n\nAtheism or lack of religious involvement might remove some societal deterrents against crime. So medium risk.\n\nPutting this all together: high factors include gender, prior arrests/convictions, job instability, and drug use. Medium includes age, living alone, mental health, religious views. Low are ethnicity, education, family background. The high-risk factors are significant enough to predict a higher chance of rearrest. Confidence is around 75% because while there are several red flags, some protective factors exist.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Gender (male)\", \"high\", \"Males have been shown to have higher rates of recidivism compared to females.\"),\n     (\"Age at first arrest (19)\", \"medium\", \"While younger age can sometimes indicate higher risk, 19 is not particularly young in the context of criminal justice statistics.\"),\n     (\"Number of prior arrests (3)\", \"high\", \"Having multiple prior arrests is a strong predictor of future recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Ethnicity (White)\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a significant predictor of recidivism when controlling for other factors, though systemic issues may play a role.\"),\n     (\"Height and weight (6'0\\\", 180 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical characteristics like height and weight are not directly linked to recidivism risk.\"),\n     (\"Marital status (never married)\", \"medium\", \"Never being married can sometimes correlate with higher recidivism rates, though this is context-dependent.\"),\n     (\"Living situation (living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk of recidivism due to lack of social support.\"),\n     (\"Education level (high school diploma)\", \"low\", \"Having a high school diploma reduces the risk compared to those without, but not having higher education may still pose some risk.\"),\n     (\"Employment history (7 jobs in one year)\", \"high\", \"High job instability is a strong indicator of potential recidivism due to financial stress and lack of stable routines.\"),\n     (\"Drug use (marijuana and cocaine past four years)\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use, especially of illicit substances like cocaine, significantly increases the risk of rearrest and recidivism.\"),\n     (\"Mental health (felt down in dumps past month)\", \"medium\", \"Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, though the impact depends on severity and treatment access.\"),\n     (\"Family background (both biological parents, urban area)\", \"low\", \"Growing up with both biological parents can be protective against recidivism, though living in an urban area may increase exposure to crime-related factors.\"),\n     (\"Religious involvement (God has nothing to do with personal events)\", \"medium\", \"Lack of religious involvement can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to fewer social and moral deterrents.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
