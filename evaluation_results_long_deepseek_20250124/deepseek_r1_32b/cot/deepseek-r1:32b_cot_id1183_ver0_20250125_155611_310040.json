    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to assess the risk of rearrest for a 22-year-old Black male who has been convicted once. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nAge: He's 22, which is in the higher range but still young. Studies show that younger individuals might have higher recidivism rates, but not excessively high here.\nSex: Male. Statistically, males are more likely to be rearrested than females, so this is a medium factor.\nRace: Black. There's systemic bias and disparities leading to higher arrest rates, which I'll consider as a medium risk.\n\nArrest history: Only one arrest and conviction. He hasn't been in trouble multiple times yet, so low risk here.\nHeight and weight: Average for his age, no significant issues here, so low risk.\nMarital status: Never married and living alone. Unmarried individuals might have less social support, making this a medium factor.\n\nEducation: Has a GED but isn't in college. Higher education reduces recidivism, so not having it is a medium risk.\nEmployment: No jobs in the last year. Joblessness can lead to more crime, so high risk here.\nDrug use: Marijuana in the past four years. Substance use increases recidivism, especially if frequent, so medium.\n\nMental health: Not depressed in the past month. Mental issues often correlate with higher risks, but since he's not currently depressed, this is low.\nChildhood living situation: Lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. This can affect social development and support systems, so high risk.\nReligious belief: Believes God influences his life. Religious involvement can lower recidivism, so medium.\n\nPutting it all together: The biggest factors are unemployment and childhood environment. Despite some protective factors like not being depressed and having religious beliefs, the lack of employment and unstable upbringing weigh heavily. I'm leaning towards a higher risk of rearrest.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"age\", \"low\", \"22 years old, which is within a moderate risk range for recidivism as younger adults may still be establishing their lives\"),\n     (\"sex\", \"medium\", \"male gender associated with higher rates of rearrest compared to female\"),\n     (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals may face systemic biases and disparities in the criminal justice system contributing to higher arrest rates\"),\n     (\"arrest_history\", \"low\", \"only one prior arrest and conviction, which indicates a lower risk compared to multiple arrests\"),\n     (\"height_weight\", \"low\", \"average height and weight for age, no significant factors related to physical size influencing recidivism\"),\n     (\"marital_status\", \"medium\", \"never married and living alone may indicate limited social support networks which can contribute to higher recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"education\", \"medium\", \"GED but not enrolled in college suggests some educational attainment but potentially limited opportunities for stable employment compared to higher education\"),\n     (\"employment\", \"high\", \"no jobs held in the past year indicates unemployment, a strong predictor of rearrest due to limited legal means of income generation and potential increased engagement in criminal activity\"),\n     (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"past four years marijuana use suggests substance involvement which can be correlated with higher recidivism rates, though less severe than harder drugs\"),\n     (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"no depression symptoms in the past month reduces risk associated with mental health issues that can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n     (\"childhood_environment\", \"high\", \"lived with non-biological parents in an urban area during youth may indicate instability and lack of strong familial support, contributing to higher recidivism rates\"),\n     (\"religious_involvement\", \"medium\", \"believes God influences personal events suggesting some level of religious involvement which can provide positive social supports and reduce recidivism risk\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
