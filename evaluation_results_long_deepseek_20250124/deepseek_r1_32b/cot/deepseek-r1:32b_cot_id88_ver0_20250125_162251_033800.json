    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of rearrest for this individual over a three-year period. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 19 years old. Young adults are more likely to engage in criminal behavior because they might still be developing emotionally and socially. Plus, older teens and young adults often have higher energy levels and less life experience, which can contribute to impulsive decisions. So I think this should be a medium risk factor.\n\nNext, being male. Studies show that men commit more crimes than women, especially violent ones. This is likely due to socialization and biological factors. So for rearrest risk, gender as male would probably be a high risk factor.\n\nRace identified as White. I know that race can sometimes influence interactions with the criminal justice system, but in terms of predicting rearrest, it's not as strong a predictor as other factors like age or prior convictions. So I might rate this as low risk unless there's more context, which there isn't here.\n\nHe has been arrested 10 times and convicted. That's a significant number of arrests, indicating a pattern of criminal behavior. High frequency of arrests usually correlates with higher recidivism rates because it shows consistent involvement in illegal activities. So this should definitely be a high risk factor.\n\nHeight is 6 feet 0 inches, weight 155 lbs. Physical stature can sometimes play a role in the types of crimes someone might commit, but I don't think it's a strong predictor for rearrest on its own. Unless there's a history related to his size, like being involved in more violent crimes, which isn't mentioned here. So maybe low risk.\n\nNever married and living alone. Marital status can be protective against recidivism because having a stable relationship might provide support and reduce the likelihood of reoffending. Living alone could also mean less supervision or fewer social ties, which might increase risk. But without more info on his social support, I'd say this is medium risk.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Education level is a strong predictor. People without formal education often have limited job opportunities and are more likely to engage in criminal behavior. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nOnly held 1 job during the year. Employment history is important because stable employment can reduce crime by providing income and structure. Having only one job might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could increase recidivism risk. So medium risk here.\n\nDrug use in past four years (marijuana and cocaine). Drug use, especially harder drugs like cocaine, is linked to higher recidivism rates because drug addiction can drive criminal behavior to sustain the habit. This should be a high risk factor.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes lead to substance abuse or other criminal behaviors as coping mechanisms. However, since he doesn't report feeling depressed recently, this might actually be protective. So low risk here.\n\nLived with biological mother in urban area with household size 4 at a young age. Family background and upbringing can influence behavior. Growing up in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates, but living with both parents could provide some stability. Without more info on family dynamics, I'm leaning towards low risk unless there are other negative factors.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor against recidivism because it provides moral guidance and social support. So this would be low risk.\n\nPutting all these together: High risks from prior arrests, education level, drug use; medium from age, living alone, employment; low or neutral from others. The presence of multiple high-risk factors suggests a higher likelihood of rearrest. I'd predict YES with maybe 85% confidence because while there are some protective factors like religion and no depression, the stronger predictors point towards recidivism.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"risk_actors\": [\n     (\"Age (19 years old)\", \"medium\", \"Young adults may have higher tendencies for criminal behavior due to developmental stages.\"),\n     (\"Gender (Male)\", \"high\", \"Men are statistically more likely to be rearrested than women.\"),\n     (\"Race/Ethnicity (White)\", \"low\", \"Race alone is not a strong predictor of recidivism without additional context.\"),\n     (\"Number of Prior Arrests (10 times)\", \"high\", \"High number of arrests indicates a pattern of criminal behavior linked to higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"Height and Weight (6'0\\\", 155 lbs)\", \"low\", \"Physical stature does not strongly predict rearrest without context on crime type.\"),\n     (\"Marital Status (Never married, living alone)\", \"medium\", \"Living alone may reduce social support but can vary based on individual circumstances.\"),\n     (\"Education Level (No diploma or GED)\", \"high\", \"Lack of education correlates with limited opportunities and higher recidivism rates.\"),\n     (\"Employment History (1 job in the past year)\", \"medium\", \"Unstable employment can increase risk by limiting financial stability and structure.\"),\n     (\"Drug Use (Marijuana and Cocaine)\", \"high\", \"Illicit drug use, especially cocaine, is linked to higher recidivism due to addiction and associated crimes.\"),\n     (\"Mental Health (No depression in the past month)\", \"low\", \"Absence of recent depression may act as a protective factor against certain criminal behaviors.\"),\n     (\"Family Background (Lived with mother in urban area)\", \"low\", \"Urban upbringing might expose to higher crime rates, but family stability is not clear here.\"),\n     (\"Religious Beliefs (Believes God influences personal events)\", \"low\", \"Religious involvement can provide moral guidance and support, reducing recidivism risk.\")\n   ],\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
