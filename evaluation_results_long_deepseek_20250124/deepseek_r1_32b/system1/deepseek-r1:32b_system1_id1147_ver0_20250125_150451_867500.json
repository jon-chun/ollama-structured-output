    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 21-year-old male Hispanic. Age is a factor because younger individuals are often more involved in criminal activities. But being Hispanic might not necessarily indicate higher risk unless there's specific context about crime rates in that community, which isn't provided here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has convictions. That seems significant because multiple arrests and convictions can indicate a pattern of behavior that's risky. Repeat offenders are often considered high risk because they have a history of breaking the law.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs 185 lbs. Physical size isn't typically a major factor in risk assessment unless it relates to specific crimes, which isn't mentioned here. So I might not give this too much weight.\n\nNever married and living alone. Some studies suggest that being unmarried or not having strong familial ties can correlate with higher risk because there's less social support or accountability. Living alone might mean fewer people monitoring his behavior, which could contribute to risky actions.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not in college. Educational attainment is a big factor. Lower education levels are often linked with higher crime rates because of limited opportunities and potential frustration leading to criminal behavior. Not being enrolled in any educational program suggests he's disengaged from systems that can provide structure and support.\n\nHeld one job during the year. Employment is usually seen as protective, but having only one job might indicate instability or limited work history. However, having a job at all could be a positive factor if it provides consistent income and routine. The fact that he's employed once might not be enough to offset other risk factors.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014marijuana specifically. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor because drugs can impair judgment, lead to addiction, and sometimes correlate with other criminal activities either to support the habit or as a result of impaired decision-making. Even though it's marijuana, which is less severe than harder drugs, any substance use can be indicative of potential issues.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is important because untreated mental illness can contribute to criminal behavior. However, not feeling depressed might actually be a positive sign here, indicating that he isn't struggling with severe emotional issues that could lead to acting out.\n\nLived in a household of six when young. Growing up in a large family can sometimes mean less individual attention and higher stress, which may contribute to behavioral issues later on. But it's not a direct indicator without more context about the family environment.\n\nBelieves God has an influence on his life. Religious beliefs can be protective as they often provide a moral framework and community support. This might indicate some level of accountability or positive influences that could mitigate risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together: He has multiple arrests/convictions, which is a strong indicator. Lack of education and limited employment are negatives. Drug use adds to the risk. However, he's not currently depressed, believes in God, and while living alone might be a factor, being employed somewhat mitigates that. The combination of criminal history, lack of education, drug use, and living situation points towards higher risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
