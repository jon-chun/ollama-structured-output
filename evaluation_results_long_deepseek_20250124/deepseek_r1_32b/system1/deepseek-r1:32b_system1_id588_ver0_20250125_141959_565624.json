    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm analyzing this case for a risk assessment. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male, Hispanic. Age is a risk factor because younger individuals are statistically more likely to be involved in criminal activities. But being Hispanic might not necessarily indicate high risk on its own; it depends on other factors.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted yet. An arrest without conviction suggests some level of contact with the law, which could imply higher risk compared to someone with no arrests. However, since there's no conviction, the risk isn't as high as if he had multiple convictions.\n\nHis height and weight are 6 feet 1 inch and 210 lbs. Physically, this doesn't directly indicate risk unless it relates to something like being a threat in confrontations, but without more context, I don't see a direct link here.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with lower social support, which might slightly increase risk factors for certain behaviors. But again, not a strong indicator on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 4-year college. Education level is generally a protective factor against criminal behavior. Being in college suggests he's engaged in positive activities and may have more structured time, which can reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nHeld five jobs during the year. That\u2019s a lot of job changes. High job turnover might indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which could be a risk factor if it leads to financial stress or other issues.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment, lead to involvement in illegal activities (like selling drugs), and contribute to other negative behaviors. Cocaine use is more concerning than marijuana, as it's associated with higher risks of addiction and criminal activity.\n\nDepression symptoms: felt so down that nothing could cheer him up some days in the past month. Mental health issues can increase risk factors by affecting decision-making, leading to substance abuse, or increasing impulsivity.\n\nEarly living situation: lived with biological mother in a household of two in an urban area. While family structure and environment can influence behavior, without more details on the home environment's stability or any abuse, it's hard to gauge the impact. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, which could be a contextual factor but not directly indicative of personal risk.\n\nReligious belief: considers God has something to do with his life. Religious affiliation is generally seen as a protective factor because it can provide a support system and moral framework that discourages criminal behavior.\n\nPutting this all together:\n\nPositive factors:\n- Education (college enrollment)\n- Religious beliefs\n- No prior convictions\n\nNegative factors:\n- Arrest history\n- Drug use (especially cocaine)\n- Frequent job changes\n- Depression symptoms\n- Young age and male gender\n\nThe negative factors, especially the substance abuse and depression, are significant. Substance use can lead to more criminal behavior, and mental health issues can exacerbate other risk factors.\n\nHowever, his educational background and current enrollment in college might mitigate some of these risks by providing a structured environment and opportunities for positive social interactions. His religious beliefs could also offer support against engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all this, I think there is a moderate risk. The presence of substance use and mental health issues raises concerns, but the protective factors like education and religion somewhat balance that out. So, confidence isn't extremely high, maybe around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
