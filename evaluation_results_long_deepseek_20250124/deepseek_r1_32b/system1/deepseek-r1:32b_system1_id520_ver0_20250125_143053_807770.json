    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female, which might be a lower risk category compared to older individuals or males in some contexts, but age can vary depending on other factors.\n\nShe's white, which might not directly indicate risk but could influence other aspects like socioeconomic background. She has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That suggests maybe a minor offense or first-time offender status, which could be low risk, but it's still an arrest record to consider.\n\nHeight and weight are within normal ranges, so nothing stands out there. Not being married and living alone could indicate some level of independence, but also possibly less social support, which might be a risk factor depending on other circumstances.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college, which might point to limited education or career prospects. Holding four jobs in a year suggests either job instability or perhaps someone who is actively seeking employment, which could be a red flag if it's due to issues like substance abuse or unreliability.\n\nDrug use history with marijuana and cocaine in the past four years is significant. Substance abuse can increase criminal risk, especially if it's ongoing or severe. However, she hasn't felt depressed recently, so mental health might not be an immediate issue here.\n\nGrowing up in a large household (six people) in an urban area could mean exposure to different environments but doesn't inherently indicate risk unless there were other issues like neglect or criminal activity in the home. She believes God has a role in her life, which might suggest some level of religious involvement or personal values that could act as protective factors.\n\nPutting it all together: The arrest history and drug use are notable risk factors. However, she's young, hasn't been convicted, isn't currently showing signs of depression, has a high school diploma, and is employed (albeit with job instability). Her belief in God might also provide some positive influence. \n\nI'm thinking the risk isn't extremely high because there are protective factors like age, education, employment, and religious beliefs. The drug use does raise concerns, but without more severe criminal history or ongoing mental health issues, it might not be enough to classify her as high risk. Therefore, I would predict low risk with a moderate confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 4 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and has not felt depressed over the past month. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 6, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
