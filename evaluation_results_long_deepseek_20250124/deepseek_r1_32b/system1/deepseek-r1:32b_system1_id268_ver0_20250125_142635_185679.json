    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 21-year-old male. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might have higher tendencies for certain behaviors. But males in general are also more likely to be involved in crime statistically.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. I'm not sure if this directly affects risk level, but sometimes cultural factors or community dynamics could play a role, though it's probably not the main factor here.\n\nFour arrests and a conviction history definitely raise some flags. Having been arrested multiple times suggests he might have ongoing issues with the law. The fact that he's been convicted means there was enough evidence for a judge or jury to find him guilty, which could indicate a pattern of behavior.\n\nHe's 5'8\" and weighs 190 lbs. Not sure if physical stature is a significant factor here. Maybe in terms of potential for certain types of crimes, but it doesn't stand out as a major risk indicator on its own.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or fewer accountability structures. Not being married could indicate different things\u2014some people are stable without marriage, others might have issues with relationships that could lead to conflict.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level can be a factor; lower education might correlate with higher crime rates, but it's not a direct cause. Holding three jobs in a year suggests some instability or maybe difficulty maintaining consistent employment. Job hopping could indicate issues with responsibility or commitment.\n\nDrug use\u2014marijuana over the past four years. Drug use can impair judgment and lead to risky behaviors. Even though marijuana is less severe than other drugs, regular use might still be a concern for risk assessment.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's actually a positive factor. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior, so the absence of that might slightly lower the risk.\n\nGrowing up with both biological parents in an urban area. Stable family environment is usually a protective factor against crime. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but growing up there doesn't necessarily mean he'll commit crimes. It depends on other factors like neighborhood safety, peer influence, etc.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his life. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a moral compass and reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal activity. It's considered a protective factor by some experts.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a history of arrests and convictions, which is a strong indicator of high risk. The other factors like living alone, job instability, drug use add to that. However, he didn't show signs of depression, had a stable upbringing, and holds religious beliefs which might mitigate the risk somewhat.\n\nSo, I think the prediction should be \"YES\" for high risk because of the arrest and conviction history outweighing some protective factors.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}",
