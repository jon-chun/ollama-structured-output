That's a moderate criminal history. He's currently employed but only held two jobs in a year, so maybe some instability there.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs for four years, which is good, but he did feel really down recently\u2014depressed even. Mental health issues can be risk factors. He lives alone, no spouse or family, which might indicate social isolation. Growing up with both parents in an urban area, household of four, so stable upbringing but maybe some stressors there.\n\nNo religious affiliation could mean less community support. His education is just a high school diploma and not in college now. So perhaps limited opportunities for advancement.\n\nPutting this together: criminal history, employment stability issues, depression symptoms, living alone, no higher education. These factors might suggest a moderate risk. Not the highest because he's been drug-free and has a job, but enough concerns to indicate some risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
