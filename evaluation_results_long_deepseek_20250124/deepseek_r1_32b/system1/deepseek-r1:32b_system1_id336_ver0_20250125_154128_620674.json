    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for this 19-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male. That might carry some societal biases or historical data points that could influence risk assessments, but I should consider how that plays into the overall picture without letting stereotypes take over.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean guilt, so this factor alone shouldn't be too significant unless there's more context about the nature of the arrest.\n\nHe's 5'10\" and weighs 180 lbs. That's average for his age, so nothing stands out here in terms of physical risk factors.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone could mean less supervision or support, which might be a factor, but it's not inherently a red flag unless combined with other issues.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with recidivism rates, but he completed high school, which is a positive sign.\n\nHe held two jobs in the past year. Employment is generally seen as a protective factor against criminal behavior because it provides stability and income. So this could be a mitigating factor.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use can sometimes be associated with other risk-taking behaviors or substance abuse issues, but it's less severe than harder drugs. However, any drug use might indicate some level of impulsivity or vulnerability to peer influence.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health is a big factor; no recent depression suggests he isn't struggling with that aspect right now, which is positive.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with his biological mother and four others. Family structure can be protective if there's strong support, but living in an urban area might come with its own set of challenges like higher crime rates or limited opportunities.\n\nHe considers God significant in his life. religiosity can sometimes be a protective factor as it may provide moral guidance and community support.\n\nPutting this all together: he has some factors that could indicate risk (arrest history, marijuana use) but also several mitigating factors (employment, education, no mental health issues, religious beliefs). His arrest hasn't led to conviction, so maybe the circumstances weren't severe. The fact that he's employed and educated suggests a level of stability.\n\nI'm leaning towards low risk because the protective factors seem to outweigh the potential risks here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
