    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high-risk individual based on the provided information. Let's go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male identifying as White. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might have higher tendencies for certain behaviors. However, race alone shouldn't be a determining factor in risk assessment.\n\nHe has been arrested four times and has a conviction. This history suggests past issues with the law, which is a significant red flag. Multiple arrests indicate possible recurring problematic behavior.\n\nHis physical description\u20146 feet 2 inches and 190 lbs\u2014is average for his age and doesn't inherently suggest any risk unless combined with other factors.\n\nHe's never been married and currently lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with less supervision or fewer accountability measures, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nEnrollment in school is a positive sign as education can often correlate with lower recidivism rates. However, he has held three jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be linked to other issues like substance abuse or poor decision-making.\n\nHe has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance use is a critical factor because it can impair judgment, lead to involvement in illegal activities, and contribute to other negative outcomes. The use of harder drugs like cocaine increases this risk.\n\nNo depression symptoms over the past month might seem positive, but sometimes individuals might self-medicate with substances when they're not feeling depressed, which could indicate underlying issues or substance dependence.\n\nHe grew up in group quarters in an urban area with a household size of four. Growing up in such environments can sometimes be associated with higher crime rates due to factors like poverty, lack of supervision, or exposure to criminal activity. However, this isn't always the case and should be considered alongside other factors.\n\nLastly, he doesn't believe God plays a role in his life. This might indicate a lack of religious involvement, which some studies have shown can correlate with higher risk behaviors if the individual lacks a strong moral framework or community support from religious groups.\n\nPutting all this together: multiple arrests, substance use (especially cocaine), living alone, frequent job changes\u2014all these factors contribute to a higher likelihood of recidivism or engaging in risky behavior. The education might slightly mitigate some risks, but the presence of substance abuse and criminal history are strong indicators. Therefore, I would predict high risk with a moderate confidence level.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
