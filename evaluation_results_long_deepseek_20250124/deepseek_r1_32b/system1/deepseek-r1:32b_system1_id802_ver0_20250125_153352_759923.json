    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male. Statistically, males in this age group are more likely to be involved in criminal activities compared to other demographics. That's a point towards higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. While race can sometimes be a factor in risk assessments, it's not always directly indicative of risk on its own without context. I'll note this but won't give it too much weight yet.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. An arrest indicates some level of involvement with the law, even if there wasn't a conviction. This suggests potential issues or behaviors that led to an encounter with law enforcement, which could be a risk factor.\n\nHis physical characteristics\u20145'8\" and 155 lbs\u2014are average for his age group and don't inherently indicate any risk factors on their own. So I can probably ignore this unless there's more context about how these factors relate to behavior or other risks.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently living alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or influence from others, which could be a factor in higher risk. However, it also depends on the individual's social support network outside of marriage or cohabitation.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, but since he's not currently pursuing higher education, there might be limited opportunities for further personal development or employment stability.\n\nHe has held two jobs during the year. Stable employment is generally seen as a protective factor against criminal behavior because it provides structure and income. However, holding only two jobs in a year could indicate job instability if these were short-term positions. If he's frequently changing jobs, that might be a concern, but without more information, I'll consider this neutral or slightly positive.\n\nHe has used drugs\u2014marijuana and cocaine\u2014in the past four years. Substance use is a significant risk factor because it can impair judgment, lead to involvement in illegal activities to obtain drugs, and contribute to other negative behaviors. Cocaine use is particularly concerning as it's more likely to be associated with higher-risk behaviors than marijuana alone.\n\nHe has felt down for some of the time in the past month, feeling nothing could cheer him up. This indicates possible symptoms of depression or another mental health issue. Mental health problems can increase the risk of criminal behavior, especially if untreated, as they may lead to substance abuse or other coping mechanisms that result in illegal activities.\n\nHe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of five. Growing up in a two-parent home is generally protective, but living in an urban area might expose him to higher crime rates and influences. However, family structure can be more influential than location in some cases.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with his personal events. Lack of religious affiliation isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own, but it could indicate a lack of certain social supports or community involvement that might otherwise act as protective factors.\n\nPutting this all together: the arrest history, substance use (especially cocaine), signs of depression, and potential job instability are significant red flags. While he has some protective factors like family background and educational attainment, the presence of multiple risk factors\u2014substance abuse, mental health issues, and a criminal encounter\u2014suggests a higher likelihood of future risk.\n\nI'm leaning towards a prediction of \"YES\" for high risk. The confidence level would be relatively high because several key indicators point to potential issues. However, since he's only been arrested once without conviction, the confidence isn't at 100%. I'll estimate around 85% confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
