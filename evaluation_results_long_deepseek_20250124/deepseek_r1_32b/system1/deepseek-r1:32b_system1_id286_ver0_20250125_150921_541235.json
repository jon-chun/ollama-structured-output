    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male, White. Age-wise, younger people might still be developing their behavior patterns, but race shouldn't inherently indicate risk unless there are systemic biases, which I should probably ignore here.\n\nHe was arrested once but not convicted. That suggests some potential for rule-breaking, but since it didn't lead to a conviction, maybe the charge wasn't serious or he had a good defense. Still, any arrest could be a red flag depending on the circumstances, but without more info, I can't tell much.\n\nHeight and weight are average\u20145'10\", 180 lbs. Not particularly relevant unless there's something about physicality in the risk factors, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean he has a stable place but also could indicate less supervision or support from others, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is in college. Education level is usually a protective factor against criminal behavior because it often correlates with better opportunities and lower chances of engaging in illegal activities. Being enrolled in a 4-year college suggests he's investing in his future, which is positive.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment is another protective factor. Having steady work can reduce the likelihood of criminal activity as it provides income and structure.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. This is significant. Substance abuse, especially harder drugs like cocaine, can impair judgment and increase the risk of engaging in illegal activities to sustain drug habits or due to impaired decision-making. Marijuana is less severe than cocaine, but any illicit drug use raises concerns about potential legal issues and behavioral risks.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes lead to higher risk behaviors, so not feeling depressed might be a positive here. However, substance use could still impact his mental state even if he's not currently depressed.\n\nGrowing up with adults other than biological, foster, or adoptive parents. This suggests maybe living with relatives or in some kind of group home or another arrangement. Such environments can sometimes lack the stability of traditional family settings, which might contribute to behavioral issues later on. However, it depends on the quality of those adult relationships.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can be a protective factor as they often provide a moral framework and support system that discourages criminal behavior.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, has some risk factors like drug use and past arrest, but also several protective factors like education, employment, religious belief. The lack of depression is neutral to positive. Substance abuse, especially cocaine, is a significant concern because it can lead to higher-risk behaviors. However, his current situation with education and work might mitigate that risk somewhat.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the risk isn't extremely high but there are elements that could indicate moderate risk. The confidence in this prediction would be around 75%\u2014not entirely certain because protective factors balance some of the risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
