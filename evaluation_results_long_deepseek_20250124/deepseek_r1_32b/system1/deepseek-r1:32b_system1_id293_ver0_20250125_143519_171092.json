    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 22-year-old male, which might be a neutral factor but sometimes younger individuals can have higher risk tendencies depending on other variables.\n\nHe identifies as White, which isn't typically a risk factor itself but could influence social dynamics or access to resources.\n\nArrested once without conviction \u2013 this suggests some involvement with the law but no formal conviction. It's a minor point against him but not as severe as multiple convictions.\n\nHeight and weight are average (5'4\", 140 lbs), which doesn't indicate any particular risk unless combined with other factors, which isn't the case here.\n\nMarried and living with spouse \u2013 this is generally a protective factor. Stable relationships can reduce recidivism rates.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level is moderate; some studies suggest higher education correlates with lower criminal behavior, but he's employed, which is positive.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year \u2013 suggests reliability and stability in employment, another protective factor.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana isn't as severe as harder drugs, but any drug use can be a risk if it affects behavior or leads to other issues.\n\nMental health: felt down in the dumps for some time in the past month. This could indicate depression or anxiety, which might affect decision-making and increase risk if untreated.\n\nLived in a household of six at a young age \u2013 large families can sometimes lead to less supervision, but this varies widely. Doesn't necessarily point to high risk on its own.\n\n Atheistic view (\"God has nothing to do with what happens\") \u2013 some studies link religiosity with lower crime rates, so the lack thereof might be a minor risk factor.\n\nPutting it all together: Some factors lean towards higher risk (arrest history, drug use, mental health indicators), but there are significant protective factors like marriage, stable employment, and education. The absence of multiple convictions, violent behavior, or severe substance abuse tempers the risk level.\n\nTherefore, while there are some red flags, the overall assessment isn't high risk. Confidence is moderate because it's a close call with both positive and negative indicators.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 140 lbs. He is married and is currently living with his spouse. He has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. He has held 2 jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived in a household of size 6. He considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
