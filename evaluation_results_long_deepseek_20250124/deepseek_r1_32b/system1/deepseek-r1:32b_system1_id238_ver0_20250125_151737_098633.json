    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm going to analyze these risk factors step by step. The individual is a 19-year-old Black male who's been arrested three times without convictions. His age might make him more susceptible to certain risks. Arrests indicate some involvement in potentially risky behavior, even without convictions.\n\nHe's 6'1\", which isn't directly a risk factor but could be relevant in terms of how others perceive him or potential situations he might find himself in. Living alone at this age is another point; it can sometimes lead to isolation or lack of supervision, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED and not enrolled in college suggests limited educational attainment, which can correlate with lower socioeconomic status and potentially higher engagement in risky activities. Holding only one job during the year indicates possible instability in employment, which could affect his financial situation and overall stability.\n\nDrug use (marijuana) in the past four years is a risk factor because substance use can lead to impaired judgment and other delinquent behaviors. Additionally, feeling down for part of the past month might indicate some level of depression or anxiety, which can influence decision-making and social behavior negatively.\n\nGrowing up in a household of eight suggests possible factors like overcrowding, financial stress, or lack of individual attention, which could contribute to behavioral issues. His belief in God having an impact on his life is a positive factor; religious involvement often correlates with lower engagement in risky behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors: young age, arrest history, limited education, unstable employment, drug use, mental health indicators, and background factors like household size. The presence of several moderate to high-risk indicators suggests a higher likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior or recidivism. However, the lack of convictions and his religious beliefs might slightly mitigate this risk.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the prediction is YES with a confidence level around 75% because while there are significant red flags, some factors also suggest potential for positive behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
