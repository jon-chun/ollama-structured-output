    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male, white. Age-wise, 22 isn't too young or old, but statistically, males in their early twenties can sometimes be associated with higher risks due to factors like impulsivity and social environment.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has convictions. That's a significant point. Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that could lead to reoffending. Convictions are even more concerning because they indicate past successful prosecutions, which might mean the person is aware of their actions leading to legal consequences but hasn't changed their behavior.\n\nHeight and weight: 6'4\" and 180 lbs. Physically, he's tall but not overweight. I don't know if that has any direct bearing on risk assessment, but it could influence how others perceive him or his ability to commit certain crimes.\n\nNever married and currently not living alone. Living with others might provide some stability, but being single can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, especially if there's a lack of supportive relationships. However, this isn't always the case.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level is moderate; not having further education might limit his job prospects and lead to frustration or other issues that could contribute to risky behavior.\n\nHeld one job during the year. That's somewhat concerning because frequent job changes can be a risk factor, but holding just one job doesn't necessarily indicate instability unless it was temporary or part-time.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana isn't as severe as harder drugs, its use can still impair judgment and lead to other risky behaviors, especially if there's a dependency or regular use.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's positive; mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with higher risk factors, so not experiencing that is a plus.\n\nGrowing up in a rural area with his biological mother in a household of three. Family stability seems okay since he lived with his mom, which might have provided some support during formative years.\n\nBelief in God's influence on personal events. Religious or spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as protective factors against risky behavior by providing moral guidance and community support.\n\nPutting it all together: The multiple arrests and convictions are the strongest indicators of high risk. Past drug use could exacerbate this, especially if there's a pattern of substance-related offenses or issues. However, his current lack of depression, living with others, and having a job might mitigate some risks. But overall, given the history of arrests and convictions, I'm leaning towards a higher risk assessment.\n</think>\n\nThe individual has several concerning factors, including multiple arrests and convictions, which are strong indicators of high risk. While there are mitigating factors such as no depression, living with others, and employment, the pattern of criminal behavior suggests a higher likelihood of reoffending.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
