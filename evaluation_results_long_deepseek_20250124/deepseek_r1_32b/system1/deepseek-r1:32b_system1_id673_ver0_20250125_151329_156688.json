    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old male and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his age is 20. Younger individuals might be more likely to engage in risky behaviors, but it's not the only factor.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure how ethnicity plays into this specifically; maybe it could relate to socioeconomic factors or access to resources, but that's speculative.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s a significant point because prior convictions are often indicators of higher risk for future offending.\n\nHeight is 5'10\", weight 190 lbs. Physical characteristics alone don't necessarily indicate risk unless they're related to something else, like size contributing to certain types of crimes, but that doesn't seem relevant here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might reduce social supervision or accountability, which could be a risk factor. Not being married might also mean less family support, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk.\n\nHigh school diploma, not in college. Educational attainment is important; lower education levels can sometimes relate to higher crime rates because of limited job opportunities, but he does have a high school diploma so that's somewhat mitigating.\n\nNo jobs in the past year. Unemployment is a strong predictor of recidivism because it reduces legitimate income sources and increases time for criminal activities.\n\nDrug use: marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a significant risk factor as it can impair judgment, lead to involvement in illegal activities to fund drug habits, and contribute to erratic behavior.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's actually a positive factor because mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk if they're untreated or severe.\n\nHe grew up with both biological parents in a household of five. A stable family environment during upbringing is generally protective against criminal behavior, so this might lower the risk.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with personal events. Religious belief can sometimes be protective because it provides a moral framework and social support. The absence of such beliefs might remove that protective factor.\n\nPutting it all together: He has prior convictions, unemployment, substance abuse\u2014these are strong indicators for higher risk. On the other hand, stable upbringing, no current depression, high school diploma somewhat mitigate but may not outweigh the negatives. So I would predict YES for high risk with a confidence around 75%.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
