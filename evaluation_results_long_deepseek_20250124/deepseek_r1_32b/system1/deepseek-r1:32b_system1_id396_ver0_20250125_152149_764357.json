    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each one carefully.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female, White. Age-wise, younger people might be at higher risk for certain crimes, but gender and race can sometimes influence statistics, though that's not always accurate.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. That's a significant point because past convictions are often used as predictors of future behavior. Even one conviction could indicate some propensity towards reoffending.\n\nHer height and weight (5'2\", 145 lbs) probably aren't risk factors on their own, so I can set that aside.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living situation can matter because having a stable home or support system might reduce risk. Being single doesn't necessarily mean high risk, but living alone could be a factor depending on other circumstances.\n\nShe has a GED but isn't in college. Educational attainment is a factor; lower education levels sometimes correlate with higher crime rates. However, she does have her GED, which is better than not completing high school. Not being enrolled might indicate less structure or fewer opportunities.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. That could be a positive sign if it shows stability, but frequent job changes can also suggest issues with consistency or responsibility. I'm not sure how to weigh this yet.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years and feeling down most of the time in the past month. This is concerning. Substance abuse, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor. Additionally, feeling persistently low could indicate mental health issues like depression, which might increase the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nFamily background: lived with her biological dad in an urban area as a child. Family dynamics and upbringing can influence behavior. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk.\n\nReligious belief: she believes God influences her life. Some studies suggest that religious involvement can be protective against criminal behavior, so this might mitigate other risk factors.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- Past conviction is a strong indicator.\n- Current drug use and depression symptoms could increase impulsivity or desperation.\n- Educational level isn't the highest but not the lowest.\n- Employment history is somewhat unstable, which might relate to other issues.\n- Living alone without a support system could be a vulnerability.\n\nThe religious belief might counteract some of these negative factors, but the combination of past conviction and current mental health/drug use are significant. The confidence level isn't extremely high because not all factors point to high risk, but there's enough here to suggest concern.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}",

She has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological dad in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
