    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing impulse control and are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. But being male also could influence risk levels since statistically, males are overrepresented in the criminal justice system. However, this alone isn't enough to determine high risk.\n\nHe identifies as Hispanic. I know that certain ethnic groups may face systemic issues or biases within the justice system, but ethnicity itself doesn't directly indicate a higher risk of reoffending without other factors present.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. This is a significant factor because having a criminal history increases the likelihood of future offenses. The fact that he has a conviction shows that he has already engaged in behavior that led to legal consequences, which could be an indicator of higher risk.\n\nHis height and weight are 5'9\" and 180 lbs. I don't see how this directly relates to risk unless there's some context about physicality contributing to criminal activity, but without more info, it's neutral.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Stable relationships can be protective factors against reoffending because they provide support and accountability. This is a positive sign that might lower the risk level.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment can influence opportunities and life choices. A GED is a good foundation, but not being enrolled in higher education might limit future prospects, which could be a factor if other issues are present.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment stability generally reduces recidivism because it provides structure and financial stability. Having multiple jobs suggests he's capable of maintaining employment, which is another protective factor.\n\nDrug use within the past four years (marijuana). Marijuana use can sometimes be a precursor to more serious substance issues or indicate involvement in activities that might lead to further legal problems, especially if there's a pattern of use or dependency. However, occasional use without other factors might not be as indicative.\n\nNo depression over the past month. Mental health is crucial because untreated mental illness can contribute to criminal behavior. The absence of current depressive symptoms is positive and reduces this risk factor.\n\nLived with non-biological parents at a young age in a household of size 2. Family dynamics early on can affect behavioral development. Living with other adults might indicate some instability or different influences during formative years, which could be a risk factor if it led to attachment issues or lack of proper guidance.\n\nConsiders God uninvolved personally. Spiritual beliefs can influence behavior and decision-making. A lack of religious involvement doesn't necessarily correlate with higher risk unless it's associated with other negative factors like substance abuse or lack of community support.\n\nPutting this all together: The presence of a criminal conviction is a strong indicator, but there are several protective factors such as being married, having stable employment, no current mental health issues. However, the drug use and early family environment could be mitigating factors that suggest some risk. The confidence level isn't extremely high because while there's a history of crime, the positive aspects might counterbalance it to some extent.\n</think>\n\nThe analysis suggests moderate risk due to the presence of a criminal conviction and past drug use, offset by protective factors like stable relationships and employment.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
