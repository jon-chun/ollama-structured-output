    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male identifying as White. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally, which could influence behavior. Being male might also play a role since statistics sometimes show higher rates of certain behaviors among males, but this varies widely.\n\nHe's been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. That arrest is a notable point. Even without a conviction, an arrest can indicate some level of involvement in activities that led to police attention. However, the lack of conviction could mean it was a minor offense or resolved without charges.\n\nHis height and weight are average\u20145'9\" and 155 lbs. I don't think these physical attributes directly contribute much to risk assessment unless there's something specific about them, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean he has less social support or supervision, which could be a risk factor if someone tends to engage in risky behaviors without oversight. However, it can also indicate independence, so it's not entirely clear-cut.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Educational attainment can be a protective factor; higher education often correlates with lower crime rates. But since he's only got a high school diploma and isn't continuing his education, that might limit his opportunities, which could influence risk levels.\n\nHe's held two jobs in the past year. Employment is usually a positive sign as it provides structure and income. Holding multiple jobs might indicate either instability or adaptability, but without more context, it's hard to say definitively.\n\nDrug use: he's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance use is a significant factor. Cocaine is particularly concerning because of its association with higher-risk behaviors and potential for addiction. Marijuana use alone isn't as indicative, especially if it's infrequent or recreational, but combined with cocaine, this could raise the risk level.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can be a contributing factor to risky behavior, so his current mental state being stable is a positive point.\n\nGrowing up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of three. This seems like a stable upbringing. Family structure and environment can have long-term effects on behavior, and having both parents present might provide more support and stability, which are protective factors.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with his personal events. Religious or spiritual beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing a sense of purpose and community, which may deter involvement in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest history, substance use (especially cocaine), living alone, not pursuing higher education\u2014these points lean towards higher risk. On the other hand, stable upbringing, current mental health, religious beliefs, and having held jobs are protective factors. The presence of both positive and negative indicators makes the prediction a bit nuanced.\n\nI think the substance use is a strong indicator here, especially cocaine, which carries more risk than marijuana. The arrest history adds to that concern. However, his stable background and current mental health might mitigate some of that risk. So, considering all these factors, I would lean towards a high-risk prediction but with moderate confidence because there are both significant red flags and protective elements.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
