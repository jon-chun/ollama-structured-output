    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 19-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might have higher tendencies for certain behaviors, but race shouldn't inherently indicate risk without context.\n\nHe's been arrested twice but not convicted. Arrests could suggest some involvement in activities that led to police attention, but no convictions mean there wasn't enough evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. That\u2019s something to consider but doesn\u2019t necessarily point to high risk on its own.\n\nHeight and weight are 5'8\" and 170 lbs. Not sure how this plays into risk assessment unless it's related to physicality in crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes indicate less supervision or support, but that's not always a bad thing. It might be neutral or slightly concerning depending on other factors.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to employment opportunities and life stability. Lack of education can contribute to higher risk if it leads to unemployment or involvement in criminal activities due to limited alternatives.\n\nUnemployed for the past year. Unemployment can be a significant factor because without steady income, individuals might turn to other means, which could include illegal activities. This is a strong indicator of potential risk.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years and has felt down most of the time in the past month. Marijuana use isn't necessarily illegal everywhere, but frequent use or dependency can affect judgment and behavior. Feeling persistently down suggests possible mental health issues, like depression, which could impact decision-making and social functioning.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of seven in an urban area. Growing up in a large family might mean less individual attention, which could contribute to behavioral issues if there were inadequate resources or support systems. Urban areas can sometimes have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than the person himself.\n\nConsiders God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes provide a support system and moral framework, which might be protective against high-risk behaviors. However, this isn't always the case and can vary widely depending on how the belief is practiced.\n\nPutting it all together: The unemployment and lack of education are significant red flags. Combined with past arrests (even without convictions), drug use, and feelings of depression, these factors could indicate a higher likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors or reoffending. However, his religious beliefs might offer some protective elements, which could slightly mitigate the risk.\n\nSo, I think he does present as high risk, but maybe not extremely so because there are some mitigating factors like his belief system and no prior convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
