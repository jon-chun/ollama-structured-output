    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess whether this individual presents a high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 21-year-old female, which might be a lower-risk category compared to older individuals or males, depending on the context. Her race is White, but that alone doesn't indicate risk unless there's a specific context suggesting otherwise.\n\nShe has been arrested twice and convicted once. That's a moderate criminal history. Repeat offenses can sometimes suggest higher risk, especially if the convictions are for serious crimes, though her record isn't specified here.\n\nHer physical stats\u20145'2\" and 120 lbs\u2014are typical and don't contribute much to risk assessment. Being married and living with her spouse might be a protective factor, as stable relationships often correlate with lower recidivism rates.\n\nShe lacks a high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is linked to employment opportunities and can influence recidivism. Without education, she may struggle to find steady work, which could increase the risk of reoffending.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs in the past year, indicating unemployment. Unemployment is a significant risk factor as it can lead to financial stress and limited positive activities, potentially pushing someone towards criminal behavior.\n\nDrug use\u2014specifically marijuana\u2014in the past four years suggests substance involvement. Even though marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, any drug use can indicate issues with impulse control or peer influence, which are relevant for risk assessment.\n\nShe hasn't been depressed recently, which is a positive sign as mental health issues can complicate recidivism. Her upbringing in a stable rural household with both biological parents might have provided a solid foundation, acting as another protective factor.\n\nHer religious belief, considering God's role in her life, could serve as an additional protective element, promoting personal accountability and community ties.\n\nPutting it all together: She has some risk factors like prior convictions, unemployment, and drug use. However, she also has several protective factors\u2014marriage, stable upbringing, religious beliefs\u2014which might mitigate the risks. The absence of severe mental health issues and a relatively short criminal history further balance the scales. Therefore, while there are red flags, the overall assessment leans towards lower risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
