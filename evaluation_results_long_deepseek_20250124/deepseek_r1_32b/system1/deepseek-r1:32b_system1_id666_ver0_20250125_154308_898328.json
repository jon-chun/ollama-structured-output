    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze the risk factors provided and determine if they indicate high risk for the individual. The person is an 18-year-old male, White, arrested twice, convicted once. He's 5'9\" and weighs 140 lbs. Not married, living alone. Enrolled in school but no jobs in the past year. Used marijuana and cocaine in the last four years. No depression in the past month. Grew up with both parents in an urban area of size 4. Believes God has a role in his life.\n\nFirst, I'll break down each factor to assess their potential impact on risk:\n\n1. Age: 18 is young, and younger individuals might have higher tendencies towards risk-taking behaviors.\n2. Gender: Male, which statistically can be associated with higher crime rates, though this varies widely.\n3. Race: White \u2013 race isn't a direct indicator of risk but can relate to socioeconomic factors.\n4. Arrests/Convictions: Two arrests, one conviction suggests some history of legal issues.\n5. Height and weight: 5'9\" and 140 lbs might be average for his age, not particularly relevant unless considering physicality in crimes, which isn't indicated here.\n6. Marital Status: Never married, living alone \u2013 could indicate less social support or stability.\n7. Education: Enrolled in school shows some level of engagement but no job history could mean limited stable income sources.\n8. Drug Use: Marijuana and cocaine use within the past four years is a significant factor. Substance abuse can correlate with higher criminal behavior, especially if seeking drugs leads to crimes.\n9. Mental Health: No depression in the past month \u2013 this is positive, as mental health issues can sometimes contribute to risk factors.\n10. Family Background: Lived with both parents in an urban area of size 4. Stable upbringing might reduce some risks but doesn't eliminate others, especially if there's a history of substance use or legal issues.\n11. Religious Beliefs: Believes God has a role \u2013 this can sometimes be protective, as religious involvement can provide a support system and deter from certain behaviors.\n\nConsidering these factors together:\n\n- The two arrests and one conviction suggest some level of past behavior that could indicate higher risk.\n- Drug use is a significant factor because substance abuse can lead to criminal activity, especially if the person is seeking to fund their habit.\n- Living alone might reduce supervision or support, which could be a factor in higher risk.\n- Enrolled in school is positive but no job history might limit opportunities and increase vulnerability to negative influences.\n\nOn the other hand:\n\n- No current depression suggests mental health isn't currently a contributing factor.\n- Growing up with both parents in a stable environment can mitigate some risks.\n- Belief in God could offer a moral framework that deters certain behaviors.\n\nThe key factors leaning towards higher risk are the prior convictions, drug use, and living alone. The protective factors include education, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs. Weighing these, the risk is moderate to high. However, considering he's enrolled in school and hasn't been involved in recent arrests beyond two times, maybe the confidence isn't extremely high but still significant.\n\nSo, I think the prediction would be \"YES\" with a confidence around 60-70%. That seems reasonable given the mix of risk factors and some protective ones.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
