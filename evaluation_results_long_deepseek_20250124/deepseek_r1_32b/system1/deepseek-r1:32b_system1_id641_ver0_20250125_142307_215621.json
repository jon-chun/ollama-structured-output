    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk for this person. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old female, which in itself doesn't necessarily indicate high risk. However, being young can sometimes correlate with higher risk due to potential impulsivity or lack of life experience.\n\nShe identifies as White. Race isn't typically a direct indicator of risk unless it's part of a larger context that might influence her experiences, such as discrimination or socioeconomic factors. But without more info, this doesn't seem significant on its own.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. This is a notable factor because having a criminal history can indicate higher risk for reoffending, especially if the conviction was recent or involved violent crimes. However, since there's only one arrest and conviction, it might not be as high-risk compared to multiple offenses.\n\nHer height and weight (5'8\", 120 lbs) are average, so they don't seem relevant to risk assessment.\n\nShe has never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a protective factor if she's managing her life independently without negative influences. However, it could also mean she lacks social support, which might increase risk depending on other factors.\n\nShe holds a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is generally a positive sign; having a GED shows some level of education, but not pursuing higher education might limit her job opportunities, potentially leading to stress or criminal behavior if she feels stuck.\n\nShe's held three jobs in the past year. Frequent job changes can sometimes indicate instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might correlate with other issues like substance abuse or mental health problems. However, holding three jobs could also mean she's seeking better opportunities, so it's a bit ambiguous.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years is positive, but she has felt down some of the time in the past month, feeling nothing could cheer her up. This suggests possible depression or anxiety, which can sometimes be linked to higher risk behaviors if not managed properly.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a child in a household of size two. Family background and upbringing can influence risk factors. Growing up in an urban area might expose her to different environments compared to rural areas, but without more details on the family dynamics or neighborhood crime rates, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe considers that God has nothing to do with personal events. This could indicate a lack of religious coping mechanisms, which some studies suggest can affect mental health and behavior. However, this is subjective and varies widely among individuals.\n\nPutting it all together: She has a criminal conviction, which is a significant risk factor. Her mental health struggles (feeling down) might exacerbate other issues. The lack of college enrollment could limit opportunities, potentially increasing stress. However, she's not using drugs currently, which is positive, and her past job stability isn't too concerning since she's held three jobs in a year.\n\nI'm leaning towards medium risk rather than high because while there are red flags like the conviction and mental health issues, there aren't enough severe indicators to classify it as high. The confidence level would be around 60% because it's not entirely clear cut; some factors could go either way depending on additional information.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 60\n}\n```",
