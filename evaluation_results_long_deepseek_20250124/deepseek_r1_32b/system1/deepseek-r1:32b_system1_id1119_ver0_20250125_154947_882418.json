    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the risk factors provided to determine if they indicate high risk. The person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Let's break down each factor.\n\nFirst, he's been arrested six times but hasn't been convicted. That suggests some involvement with the law, even without convictions. His age might be a factor since younger individuals sometimes engage in more risky behaviors.\n\nHe's tall (6'2\") and underweight at 140 lbs. That could indicate poor health or substance use, which is another factor mentioned\u2014he has used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and has been feeling very down recently. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes lead to increased risk behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't completed high school or a GED and isn't in college. Lack of education can limit job opportunities, potentially leading to involvement in illegal activities if other support systems aren't present.\n\nUnemployment for the past year is another red flag. Without stable employment, there might be more time and inclination towards negative behaviors. Living alone could also mean less supervision or support, which might contribute to higher risk.\n\nGrowing up in a household of four isn't inherently bad, but depending on the environment, it could have contributed to his current situation. His belief in God might offer some positive influence, though it's not clear how strong that factor is in mitigating other risks.\n\nPutting this all together: multiple arrests (even without convictions), substance use, mental health issues, lack of education and employment, living alone, and young age. These factors collectively point towards a higher risk profile. The confidence level isn't extremely high because some factors might not be as significant individually, but the combination suggests moderate to high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
