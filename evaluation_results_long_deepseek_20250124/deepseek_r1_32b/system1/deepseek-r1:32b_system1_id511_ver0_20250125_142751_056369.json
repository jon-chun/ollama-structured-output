    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this person's risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, the person is a 19-year-old male identifying as Black. Age can be a factor since younger individuals might still be developing decision-making skills. Being Black could relate to systemic issues, but without more context on how that affects this individual, it's hard to say.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. That\u2019s a significant point because having a criminal record is often seen as a risk factor for future offending. It suggests he might have a propensity towards breaking the law again.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet tall and 165 lbs. I don't think height or weight alone are strong indicators of risk unless there's context about how they're used, like in violent crimes, which isn\u2019t mentioned here.\n\nNever married and currently living alone. Living alone can sometimes be a factor if it leads to isolation or lack of supervision. However, being single at 19 isn't unusual and doesn't necessarily indicate high risk on its own.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a four-year college. Education is typically a protective factor against criminal behavior because it often correlates with better opportunities and social integration.\n\nHeld three jobs during the year. Employment can be both positive and negative. Having multiple jobs might suggest instability or seeking income sources, which could sometimes lead to risky behaviors if not managed well. However, having steady employment is usually a good sign.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, especially marijuana, is a risk factor but its impact varies. It can impair judgment and increase likelihood of other illegal activities, especially if he's using frequently or in dangerous contexts.\n\nFeeling down in the dumps some days in the past month. Mental health issues are important because depression or anxiety can sometimes lead to self-destructive behaviors or crimes related to emotional distress.\n\nLived with both biological parents in a household of three when young. Growing up in a stable family environment is usually protective, so this might mitigate other risk factors.\n\nConsiders that God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can provide support and reduce the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors by offering moral guidelines.\n\nPutting it all together: He has a criminal history (conviction), which is a strong indicator. However, he's pursuing higher education and was raised in a stable home, both protective factors. The marijuana use and recent depression symptoms could increase risk. The confidence isn't extremely high because some factors are mitigating his risks.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 3. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
