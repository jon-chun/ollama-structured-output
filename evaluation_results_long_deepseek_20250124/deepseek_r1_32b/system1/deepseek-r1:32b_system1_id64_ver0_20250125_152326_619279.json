    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's a 22-year-old female, White. Age-wise, being young can sometimes be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing, but it's not necessarily a red flag on its own. Being female also generally isn't a high-risk indicator compared to males, though that can vary based on other factors.\n\nShe's been arrested once and has a conviction. That's a significant point. Having a prior conviction does indicate some level of risk because it shows she's had contact with the criminal justice system before. However, the type of offense isn't specified here, so I'm not sure if it was minor or something more serious.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'6\" and 115 lbs. Physical attributes alone don't typically indicate risk unless there's a specific context, like if she's underweight for her age, which could point to substance abuse or other issues. But without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nShe's never been married and is living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk because there might be less supervision or support. However, many people live alone and don't pose any risks, so this factor needs to be considered alongside others.\n\nShe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Education level can play a role; higher education often correlates with lower recidivism rates. Not being enrolled in college might suggest limited future opportunities, which could contribute to risk if she's struggling economically or socially.\n\nShe's held one job during the year. Employment history is important. Having stable employment can be protective against reoffending, but holding only one job doesn't necessarily indicate instability unless there's a pattern of short-term employment or frequent job changes.\n\nDrug use in the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana. Substance use, even if it's marijuana, can be a risk factor because it might lead to other behaviors or contribute to legal issues. The frequency and context of this drug use aren't provided, so it's hard to assess fully.\n\nNo depression over the past month is positive. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with higher risk, especially if they're untreated. Not feeling depressed reduces that particular concern.\n\nShe grew up in an urban area with both biological parents in a household of four. Stable upbringing with both parents is generally protective against high-risk behaviors. Urban areas might have different crime rates or influences, but again, this varies widely.\n\nReligious beliefs\u2014she considers God has something to do with her personal events. Religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor as it may provide support and a framework for behavior.\n\nPutting all this together: She has a prior conviction, which is a notable risk factor. However, she's young, female, had a stable upbringing, isn't currently depressed, and has some level of education and employment. The drug use could be a concern but without more details on its impact or frequency, it's hard to weigh heavily.\n\nSo, considering these factors, I'm leaning towards her being moderate risk rather than high. The prior conviction is the biggest factor pulling towards higher risk, but other protective elements like family background, religious beliefs, and education might mitigate that.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
