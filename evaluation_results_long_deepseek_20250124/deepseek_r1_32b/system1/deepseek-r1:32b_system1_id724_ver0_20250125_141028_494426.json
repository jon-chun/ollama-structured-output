    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm faced with this risk assessment query from a user who wants me to determine if certain risk factors indicate high risk. They specified responding only with a JSON object containing \"prediction\" and \"confidence\". \n\nFirst, I need to parse the given risk factors carefully. The person is a 21-year-old male, which might be relevant as younger individuals sometimes have higher tendencies for certain behaviors. He's White, but race alone isn't typically a predictive factor unless other variables are involved.\n\nHe's been arrested eight times and has convictions. That's a significant red flag because multiple arrests and convictions can indicate a pattern of law-breaking behavior. The number of arrests is high enough to suggest possible recidivism tendencies.\n\nLooking at his personal circumstances: he's living alone, never married. Living alone might not be a risk factor on its own, but combined with other factors like lack of stable relationships or support systems, it could contribute. Never being married doesn't inherently indicate risk, but it's part of the profile.\n\nHe has a GED and isn't in college. Educational attainment is a known factor; lower education levels can correlate with higher crime rates. Holding two jobs during the year suggests some level of employment stability, which might actually be protective against criminal behavior. However, this needs to be weighed against other factors.\n\nDrug use within the past four years\u2014specifically marijuana\u2014could indicate substance involvement, though it's less severe than harder drugs. The absence of depression in the last month is a positive sign; mental health issues can sometimes exacerbate risk factors.\n\nHe grew up with his biological dad in a household of four. Family structure is important; having a father figure present could be protective, but if there were issues within that household, it might not mitigate other risks. \n\nHe doesn't believe God plays a role in his life. This lack of religious affiliation might not directly impact risk but could suggest a different value system or support network.\n\nPutting this all together: the high number of arrests and convictions are strong indicators of potential recidivism. The GED without college education, marijuana use, living alone, and no current marriage add to the risk factors. However, his employment history might slightly mitigate some risks.\n\nI need to balance these elements. While there's a significant concern due to multiple arrests and substance use, the lack of mental health issues and having a job provide some protective factors. Therefore, I'm leaning towards a high-risk prediction but with a confidence level that acknowledges both the strong indicators and mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
