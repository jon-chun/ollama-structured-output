    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to break this down step by step. So, the user is asking me to analyze several risk factors and determine if they indicate high risk. They want a JSON response with \"prediction\" as either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I need to understand each of the provided risk factors:\n\n1. **Age**: The person is 18 years old. Young age can sometimes be a factor in higher risk because of potential impulsiveness or lack of experience.\n2. **Gender**: Female. Gender can play a role in some studies, though it's not always a strong indicator on its own.\n3. **Race/Ethnicity**: Identifies as White. This might relate to socioeconomic factors but isn't a direct risk factor.\n4. **Criminal History**: Arrested once but no convictions. An arrest without conviction can sometimes be seen as lower risk, especially if the charges were dismissed or not pursued further.\n5. **Height and Weight**: 5'4\" and 130 lbs. Physical characteristics aren't typically significant in risk assessment unless there's a specific context (like job-related).\n6. **Marital Status**: Never married, currently living alone. Living alone might be neutral but could indicate independence or possible social isolation.\n7. **Education**: Enrolled in school. This is generally positive and can lower risk as education often correlates with stability.\n8. **Employment History**: Held 3 jobs in a year. Frequent job changes can sometimes raise concerns about instability or difficulty maintaining employment, which might be linked to other issues.\n9. **Substance Use**: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance use is a significant risk factor, especially if it's recent or problematic.\n10. **Mental Health**: Felt down in the dumps for some of the past month. This indicates possible depression or mental health struggles, which can be linked to higher risk behaviors.\n11. **Family Background**: Lived with biological dad in an urban area at a young age. Family dynamics and environment can influence behavior but depend on context.\n12. **Spirituality**: Believes God has something to do with personal events. Spiritual beliefs can sometimes provide support or might be a factor in decision-making.\n\nNow, considering each of these points:\n\n- The substance use is a red flag. Both marijuana and cocaine are substances that can lead to dependency and related crimes.\n- Recent feelings of depression could indicate stressors that might influence behavior, possibly leading to criminal activity as a coping mechanism.\n- Frequent job changes might suggest instability or issues maintaining consistent work, which could be a sign of underlying problems.\n\nHowever, some factors mitigate the risk:\n\n- Being enrolled in school suggests she's actively working towards her future and may have support structures in place.\n- No convictions despite an arrest might indicate that any past behavior didn't result in criminal charges, possibly due to lack of severity or intervention.\n\nPutting it all together: The presence of substance use and recent mental health struggles are significant factors. These can increase the likelihood of engaging in high-risk behaviors, especially if not addressed. However, her current enrollment in school might provide some protective factors.\n\nI think the risk is moderately high but not extremely so. Therefore, the prediction would be \"YES\" with a confidence level around 75%. This accounts for the substance use and mental health issues while considering mitigating factors like education.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
