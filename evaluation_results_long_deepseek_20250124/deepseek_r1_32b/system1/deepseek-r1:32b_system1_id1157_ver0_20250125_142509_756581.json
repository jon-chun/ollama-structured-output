    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's analyze this case step by step. The individual is a 19-year-old Hispanic female with no criminal convictions but one arrest. Her education is limited to a high school diploma without current college enrollment. She's held only one job in the past year, which might indicate instability or limited work experience.\n\nShe has a history of drug use\u2014marijuana and cocaine within the last four years\u2014and recent signs of depression, feeling down with nothing cheering her up some days. These mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors if left unaddressed.\n\nLiving alone without a spouse could mean she doesn't have immediate familial support, which might affect her decision-making or coping mechanisms. Her upbringing in an urban area with a household size of five suggests she's from a potentially resource-limited environment, which could be a contributing factor to her current circumstances.\n\nHer religious beliefs indicate some form of personal structure and possibly community support, but it's unclear how this influences her behavior directly.\n\nConsidering all these factors: arrest history without conviction (low), limited job stability (moderate), recent drug use (high), depression symptoms (high). The combination of substance abuse and mental health issues often points to higher risk for recidivism or other negative outcomes. However, the lack of a conviction might slightly lower the overall risk.\n\nI'd predict high risk but with moderate confidence because while there are red flags, some factors like no prior convictions and potential community support from her religious beliefs could mitigate the risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 1 time but has not been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 1 job during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 5, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
