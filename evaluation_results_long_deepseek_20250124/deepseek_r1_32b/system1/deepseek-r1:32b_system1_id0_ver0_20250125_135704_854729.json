    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess whether this individual is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is an 18-year-old male Hispanic. Age-wise, being 18 is a bit young but not necessarily high risk. However, males are often overrepresented in criminal statistics, so that's a consideration. Ethnicity can sometimes be correlated with higher arrest rates due to systemic issues, but it's not the sole factor.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and has convictions. That's a significant red flag. Multiple arrests suggest a pattern of behavior that's leading to legal trouble. The fact that he's been convicted means there was enough evidence for a conviction, which indicates past illegal activities.\n\nHeight is 5'0\", weight between 150-174 lbs. Physical size isn't directly linked to risk unless considering factors like being more intimidating, but at 5'0\" and average weight, he's not particularly imposing.\n\nNever married and currently not living alone. Not being in a committed relationship could be a factor since stable relationships sometimes deter criminal behavior. Living with others might indicate lack of independence or support, which can both have positive or negative implications depending on the environment.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often inversely related to crime rates. Without education, it's harder to get stable jobs, leading to potential economic pressures that could contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nHeld no jobs during the year. Unemployment can be a risk factor as it may lead to financial stress and time on hands which can sometimes result in illegal activities.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Drug use, even if not hard drugs, can indicate issues with substance abuse, which is linked to higher crime rates. It might also suggest involvement in activities that could bring him into contact with more dangerous elements or situations.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's actually a positive factor since mental health issues can sometimes correlate with increased risk behaviors.\n\nLived with his biological mother in a household of six in an urban area. Growing up in a larger family might have protective factors if there was strong familial support, but it could also mean overcrowding and potential stressors. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, which could influence behavior through environmental factors like exposure to crime or lack of positive role models.\n\nConsiders that God has something to do with his personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing a moral framework and support network, potentially reducing the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators. Lack of education and employment could contribute to continued risk. Drug use adds another layer. On the other hand, no depression and religious beliefs might mitigate some risks. The confidence level is high because the number of negative factors outweighs the positive ones.\n</think>\n\nThe individual presents several significant risk factors, including multiple arrests and convictions, lack of education, unemployment, and drug use. These factors suggest a higher likelihood of future criminal behavior despite some mitigating factors like no depression and religious beliefs.\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
