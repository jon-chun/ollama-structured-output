    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the individual is a 20-year-old male Hispanic. Age-wise, younger people are generally considered higher risk because they're still developing and more prone to impulsive behavior. However, being Hispanic isn't necessarily a risk factor on its own unless there's cultural context I'm missing here.\n\nHe has been arrested three times but not convicted. That's a bit concerning. Arrests can indicate potential behavioral issues or legal involvement, even if there were no convictions. It suggests some level of interaction with the law that might be cause for concern.\n\nHeight and weight: 6 feet tall and 185 lbs. Physically, he seems average. No immediate red flags here unless his size is relevant to specific types of crimes, but nothing stands out in this context.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone can sometimes correlate with higher risk if there's a lack of support or supervision. However, being single at 20 isn't unusual and doesn't inherently mean high risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Education level is positive; he's pursuing further education which typically lowers risk factors as it indicates responsibility and future orientation.\n\nFour jobs in a year seems like a lot of job changes. High job turnover can sometimes indicate instability or difficulty maintaining consistent employment, which might be a concern. It could suggest issues with reliability or adapting to work environments.\n\nDrug use: marijuana over the past four years. Substance use is definitely a risk factor. Even though marijuana is less severe than harder drugs, regular use can impair judgment and lead to other risky behaviors. However, it's not as concerning as harder substances.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That's a positive sign. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes contribute to higher risk, so his current mental state seems stable.\n\nLived in a household of size three at a young age. Family structure isn't directly provided here, but a smaller household might mean fewer influences or perhaps more individual attention, which isn't inherently negative.\n\nBelieves God has a role in personal events. Religious beliefs can sometimes be protective factors as they provide a sense of purpose and community support, which can reduce risky behavior.\n\nPutting this all together: The factors that lean towards higher risk include being young, multiple arrests (even without convictions), frequent job changes, and marijuana use. However, the positive aspects like education, lack of depression, living situation, and religious beliefs mitigate some of these risks. The confidence isn't extremely high because while there are several red flags, there's also evidence of stability in education and mental health.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
