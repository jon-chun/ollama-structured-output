    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the given risk factors indicate high risk. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male. Young males are often overrepresented in crime statistics, so that's a point of consideration but not definitive.\n\nHe identifies as White. Race can sometimes be a factor in statistical models, but it shouldn't be the sole determinant and should be approached with caution to avoid bias.\n\nHe has been arrested once but hasn't been convicted. An arrest doesn't necessarily mean guilt, but it could indicate some level of involvement in activities that led to police attention. However, no conviction suggests either innocence or a lack of sufficient evidence.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6\" and 202 lbs. Physically, he's above average weight but not necessarily indicating anything specific about risk unless combined with other factors like health issues, which aren't mentioned here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk because there's no immediate familial oversight or support. However, this isn't a direct indicator of criminal behavior.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment can sometimes correlate with lower recidivism rates, especially if the person is continuing education. Not being enrolled might suggest less engagement in structured activities that could provide positive reinforcement.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment is generally seen as a protective factor against criminal behavior because it provides stability and income. However, holding multiple short-term jobs could indicate instability or difficulty maintaining consistent employment, which might be a risk factor if job tenure is brief or inconsistent.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use isn't typically considered a serious offense on its own, but it can sometimes lead to other issues like impaired judgment or dependency, depending on frequency and context.\n\nMental health: In the past month, he has felt down and nothing could cheer him up some of the time. This indicates possible depression or other mental health issues. Mental health problems can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors if untreated or if they lead to substance abuse as a coping mechanism.\n\nFamily background: Lived with both biological parents in a household of 10 when young. A large family size could have implications, but it's not inherently positive or negative. It depends on the dynamics within the household. Stability and support from both parents are generally protective factors.\n\nReligious beliefs: Considers that God has something to do with what happens personally. Religious affiliation can sometimes be a protective factor as it may provide a sense of purpose and community, reducing the likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together, some risk factors exist (arrest history, drug use, mental health indicators) but there are also protective factors like having both parents present during upbringing, religious beliefs, and employment. The confidence level isn't extremely high because while there are red flags, they aren't overwhelming, and the presence of protective factors mitigates the risk somewhat.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 45\n}\n```",
