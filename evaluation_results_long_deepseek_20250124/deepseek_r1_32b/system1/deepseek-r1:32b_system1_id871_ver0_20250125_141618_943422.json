    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. The user is asking me to act as an experienced risk assessment expert and analyze the given risk factors. They want a JSON response with a prediction of \"YES\" or \"NO\" indicating high risk and a confidence level between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, I'll look at each risk factor provided:\n\n1. **Demographics**: 18-year-old female, identifies as Black. Age is a factor because younger individuals might be more prone to certain behaviors. Being female, the risk factors might differ from males. Race could influence systemic issues but isn't inherently a risk factor.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: Arrested 7 times and has convictions. This is a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and convictions suggest a pattern of behavior that's likely to continue, especially if there's no intervention.\n\n3. **Substance Abuse**: Used cocaine in the past four years and all of last month felt extremely down. Substance abuse often correlates with higher recidivism rates because drug use can impair judgment and lead to more criminal activity as individuals seek to sustain their habit.\n\n4. **Employment/Education**: No high school diploma, not enrolled in college, no jobs in the past year. Lack of education and stable employment can limit opportunities, leading some individuals into criminal activities as a means of survival or for other reasons.\n\n5. **Living Situation**: Living alone without being married. This might indicate a lack of social support, which can be a risk factor. Social isolation can sometimes lead to increased risky behavior because there's no one monitoring or influencing positive choices.\n\n6. **Family Background**: Lived with both biological parents in a rural area as a child. While having both parents is generally protective, the environment might have other factors that aren't specified here. Rural areas can sometimes have different challenges compared to urban settings, but this isn't inherently high risk.\n\n7. **Religious Beliefs**: Considers God has nothing to do with her personal events. This could indicate a lack of spiritual support or coping mechanisms, which might be a contributing factor to higher risk behaviors.\n\nPutting all these together, the person has multiple strikes against them in terms of risk factors. The criminal history and substance abuse are strong indicators. Without stable employment or education, it's harder to break the cycle. Living alone without a supportive network can exacerbate these issues. While her family background might have been protective as a child, other current factors negate that protection.\n\nTherefore, considering all these elements, the risk assessment points towards a high likelihood of future criminal behavior. The confidence level is set at 85% because while there's a strong indication, individual circumstances can vary, and without more specific details on her treatment or support systems, it's not a certainty.\n</think>\n\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}",

She has been arrested 7 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 120 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (cocaine) and all of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 5, in a rural area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
