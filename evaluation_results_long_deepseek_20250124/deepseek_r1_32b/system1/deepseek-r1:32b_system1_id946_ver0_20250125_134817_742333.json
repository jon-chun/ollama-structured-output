    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm analyzing this risk assessment case for a 22-year-old female. Let me break down the factors step by step.\n\nFirst, she's White and separated, living alone. That might mean some social isolation which could be a risk factor because support systems are important. She has a GED but isn't in college, so education level is moderate but not high. No jobs in the past year suggests unemployment, which can sometimes correlate with higher risk if someone isn't engaged in stable work.\n\nShe's had one arrest and conviction, which is a red flag. Criminal history is significant because it shows past behavior that could indicate future risks. However, she hasn't used drugs in four years, which is positive. That shows some stability and perhaps recovery from substance issues, which can be a good sign.\n\nHer mental health is a concern. She's felt really down in the dumps for parts of the last month. Depression or low mood can impact decision-making and might increase the risk of engaging in negative behaviors if she's not getting support.\n\nShe lived with non-biological adults in a large household as a child, which could indicate unstable family dynamics or neglectful environments that might have contributed to her current situation.\n\nReligious beliefs are noted\u2014she believes God influences her life. That can be a protective factor, providing some sense of purpose and community, which may help mitigate other risks.\n\nPutting it all together: the arrest and conviction are strong indicators. Unemployment and possible social isolation add to that. Mental health issues could exacerbate risk if not managed. However, her abstaining from drugs for four years is positive. The overall balance leans towards high risk because of the criminal history and current circumstances like unemployment and mental health challenges.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
