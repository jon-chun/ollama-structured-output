    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors for a 22-year-old Black female and determine if they indicate high risk. Let me go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted yet. That could be a red flag because even without convictions, arrests might suggest some level of involvement in criminal activity or behavioral issues. But since there are no convictions, it's not as strong an indicator as if she had convictions.\n\nShe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Educational attainment is often linked to lower crime rates because education can provide opportunities and skills that reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. So this might be a significant risk factor.\n\nShe's held no jobs during the year. Employment is another protective factor against crime. Without stable employment, individuals might feel more inclined to engage in illegal activities for financial reasons or lack of structure in their lives.\n\nShe has used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can sometimes lead to other criminal behaviors, especially if she's using it regularly or if her usage is problematic. However, marijuana is less severe compared to harder drugs, so this might not be as significant a factor on its own.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with higher risk of criminal behavior, so that's a mitigating factor here.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household size of 2. Family structure can be important; living with both parents is generally seen as protective. However, since the information doesn't specify if this was stable or if there were any issues within the family, it's hard to gauge the impact.\n\nShe considers that God has something to do with her personal events. Religious involvement can sometimes act as a protective factor by providing support and reducing engagement in risky behaviors.\n\nPutting all these together: lack of education, unemployment, drug use, and previous arrests might indicate some risk factors. However, she hasn't been convicted, isn't currently depressed, and has a religious belief which could be protective. So while there are several concerning points, the absence of certain severe indicators like convictions or current mental health issues might lower the overall risk assessment.\n\nI think the prediction should be \"YES\" indicating high risk because factors like lack of education, unemployment, and drug use can contribute to higher risk, even without a conviction. The confidence level would need to reflect that while there are significant risk factors, they aren't as strong as if she had convictions or more severe mental health issues.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
