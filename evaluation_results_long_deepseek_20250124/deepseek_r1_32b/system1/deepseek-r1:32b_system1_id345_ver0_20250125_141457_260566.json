    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's break this down step by step. I'm supposed to analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk, then respond with a JSON object as specified.\n\nFirst, looking at the individual's profile: he's a 20-year-old male, White, arrested once and convicted. That immediately raises some flags because having a conviction history is often linked to higher recidivism rates. His age is on the younger side, but statistically, younger individuals might still be in a phase where they're establishing patterns of behavior.\n\nHe's 5'7\" and weighs 128 lbs. While not particularly relevant to risk assessment, body size isn't typically a major factor unless it relates to physicality in crimes, which doesn't seem applicable here.\n\nLiving alone without being married might suggest limited social support, which could be a risk factor. Social isolation can sometimes correlate with higher risks because there's less oversight or support from others. However, this can vary widely depending on the individual's circumstances and community ties.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't in college. Educational attainment is generally protective against criminal behavior, so having at least a high school diploma is positive. However, not being enrolled in higher education might limit future opportunities, which could be a risk if he feels stuck or frustrated.\n\nHolding four jobs in a year indicates some instability in employment. Frequent job changes can sometimes reflect difficulty maintaining steady work, which might relate to issues with reliability or decision-making. Unstable employment is often linked to higher stress and potential engagement in criminal activities as an alternative means of income.\n\nHe's used marijuana in the past four years. While marijuana use isn't as strongly associated with crime as harder drugs, it can still be a factor if it leads to dependency or impairs judgment, especially when combined with other risk factors. However, since he hasn't used it more recently or in a problematic way described here, this might have a moderate impact.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month, which is positive. Mental health issues like depression can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, so his current mental state seems stable, which is a protective factor.\n\nGrowing up in a rural area with both biological parents in a household of four suggests a relatively stable upbringing. Having both parents present is generally protective against delinquency and crime. However, living in a rural area might limit access to certain resources or opportunities, which could be a double-edged sword depending on the context.\n\nHe considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a belief system or spirituality, which can act as a protective factor by providing a moral framework and support network through religious communities.\n\nPutting it all together: The main risk factors are his criminal history (arrest and conviction), frequent job changes indicating instability, and marijuana use. These could point towards higher risk. However, the protective factors include a stable upbringing with both parents, a high school diploma, not feeling depressed, and having a belief system. \n\nThe confidence isn't extremely high because while there are several risk indicators, the protective factors temper that risk somewhat. So, I'd lean towards predicting \"YES\" for high risk but with moderate confidence, say around 65%. This is a balance between acknowledging the presence of risk factors without overestimating due to existing mitigating factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
