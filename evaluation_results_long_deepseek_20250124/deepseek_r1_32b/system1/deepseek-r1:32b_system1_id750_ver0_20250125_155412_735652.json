    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out if this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, age 18-20 years old male. Young males are often associated with higher crime rates, especially in certain categories like property crimes or violent crimes. So that might be a point towards higher risk.\n\nHe identifies as White. I'm not sure how ethnicity plays into risk assessment; it's more about socioeconomic factors and environment usually, but maybe there's some data suggesting different trends among ethnic groups.\n\nArrested once but no conviction. That could indicate either he was innocent or perhaps the charges were dropped, which might mean lower risk compared to someone with multiple convictions. But it still shows some involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nHeight 6'2\" and weight over 250 lbs. Physical size can sometimes be a factor in certain types of crimes, especially if there's a history of violent behavior, but without other indicators, I'm not sure how significant this is.\n\nNever married, living alone. Living alone might increase the likelihood of involvement in criminal activities since there's less supervision or accountability. However, being enrolled in school suggests some level of responsibility and structure.\n\nEnrolled in school currently. Education can be a protective factor against crime because it provides opportunities and keeps individuals engaged in positive activities.\n\nHeld two jobs in the past year. Employment is usually seen as a positive sign because it offers stability and reduces idle time that could be spent on criminal activities. However, holding multiple jobs might indicate financial stress or instability, which could be a risk factor if the person feels pressured to commit crimes for money.\n\nUsed marijuana in the past four years. Marijuana use can sometimes be associated with other risky behaviors or substance abuse, but it's not as directly linked to violent crime as harder drugs. However, any drug use can impair judgment and increase the likelihood of involvement in minor offenses.\n\nNot felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues like depression are often linked to higher risk factors because they can lead to impulsivity or other negative behaviors. So, not feeling depressed is a positive sign here.\n\nLived with both biological parents in an urban area as a child. Growing up in a two-parent household generally reduces risk compared to single-parent households. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than individual risk factors.\n\nBelieves God has something to do with personal events. Religious beliefs can be protective factors because they provide a sense of purpose and community support, which can deter involvement in criminal activities.\n\nPutting it all together: There are some red flags like being young, arrested once, drug use, living alone, but there are also positive signs like education, employment, stable family background, religious beliefs. The lack of conviction is good, and he's currently engaged in school and work. So while not entirely low risk, the positives seem to outweigh the negatives here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",

At a young age, he lived with both of his biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n"
