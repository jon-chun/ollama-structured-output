    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is a high risk based on the given factors. Let me go through each point one by one.\n\nFirst, she's a 19-year-old female identifying as Black. Age is a factor because younger individuals might still be developing decision-making skills. However, gender and race can sometimes lead to biases in assessments, so I need to be cautious here.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. That's a point against her because even if she wasn't convicted, being arrested could indicate some level of risk or past behavior that warranted police attention. But since there's no conviction, it's less clear-cut.\n\nHer height and weight are 5'2\" and 140 lbs. I don't think these physical attributes contribute much to risk assessment, so maybe not a significant factor here.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is living alone. Living alone might mean she doesn't have the support system that comes with being in a relationship or having roommates, which could be a risk factor if she's isolated.\n\nNo high school diploma or GED, and not enrolled in college. Education level can impact job opportunities and overall stability. Without formal education, it might be harder for her to secure steady employment, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs during the year. Unemployment can lead to financial stress, which is a known risk factor for criminal behavior or other negative outcomes because of the lack of structure and income.\n\nNo drug use in the past four years but she's been feeling down most of the time. Mental health issues are significant. Feeling consistently low could indicate depression or anxiety, which might affect her judgment and overall stability. However, no recent substance abuse is a positive point.\n\nShe lived with foster parents in an urban area as a child. Foster care can sometimes be associated with higher risk factors due to potential instability or past challenges within the family structure.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has any influence on her life. This might relate to her mental health and support systems, but it's not directly indicative of criminal risk unless it's tied into other behaviors.\n\nPutting this all together: she's young, arrest history (though no conviction), unemployed, low education, living alone, feeling down, and from a foster care background. The lack of education and unemployment are strong indicators of possible future issues because they can lead to financial strain and lack of opportunities. Her mental health struggles could exacerbate these problems.\n\nOn the other hand, she hasn't used drugs recently and doesn't have a conviction. These factors might slightly lower her risk compared to someone with more severe criminal history or substance abuse.\n\nConsidering all this, I think she's at a higher than average risk but not extremely high. Maybe around 75% confidence that she indicates high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

She has not used any drugs in the past four years and most of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
