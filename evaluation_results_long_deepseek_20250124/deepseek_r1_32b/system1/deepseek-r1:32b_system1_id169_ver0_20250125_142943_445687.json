    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to analyze the risk factors provided for this individual and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 21-year-old male, white. Age can be a factor because younger individuals might still be developing socially and emotionally, which can sometimes lead to impulsive behavior. However, being white might not have a direct impact on risk unless there are specific biases or patterns in the data that aren't mentioned here.\n\nHe's been arrested three times and has convictions. This is a significant red flag. Multiple arrests and prior convictions suggest a history of delinquency or criminal behavior, which can be indicative of a higher likelihood to reoffend. It shows a pattern rather than just isolated incidents, so this definitely points towards high risk.\n\nHis physical characteristics: 6 feet tall and 210 lbs. While size can sometimes correlate with certain types of crimes, it's not a direct indicator. Unless there's a specific context or history related to his size contributing to criminal behavior, I won't give this too much weight.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone could mean less supervision or accountability, which might be a risk factor if the individual has a tendency towards substance abuse or other negative behaviors without someone checking in on them. However, being single isn't inherently a risk factor unless combined with other elements like isolation or lack of support networks.\n\nHigh school diploma and not enrolled in college. Educational attainment can influence risk levels. While having a high school diploma is good, not continuing education might limit future opportunities, potentially leading to frustration or involvement in criminal activities if job prospects are poor. But this isn't definitive on its own.\n\nHe's held two jobs during the year. Employment history can be a protective factor against crime because it provides structure and income. However, holding only two jobs over a year might indicate instability if those positions were short-term or if there were gaps between them. Job stability is important for reducing recidivism risk.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use, even if it's marijuana, can be associated with higher risk of criminal behavior, especially if it leads to impaired judgment or if the individual is involved in activities related to drug distribution. The fact that he hasn't used recently might slightly mitigate this risk, but prior use still indicates a history that could resurface.\n\nNo depression over the past month. This is a protective factor. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors, so not experiencing depression lowers the risk in this area.\n\nHe lived with both biological parents in an urban area during his youth. Growing up in a stable family environment with both parents present is generally a protective factor. It suggests a supportive upbringing which might reduce the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior. However, if there were issues within that household (not mentioned here), it could have different implications.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with personal events. Religious or spiritual beliefs can serve as a protective factor by providing a sense of purpose and moral guidance, reducing the likelihood of engaging in harmful behaviors. This is another point against high risk.\n\nPutting it all together: The significant factors pointing towards higher risk are multiple arrests/convictions, living alone without supervision, substance use history, and perhaps unstable employment. On the other hand, protective factors include stable family background, religious beliefs, not being depressed, and having a high school diploma. \n\nThe presence of prior convictions is a strong indicator of potential future risk. Even though there are several protective factors, the criminal history might outweigh them in terms of predictive analytics used in risk assessments.\n\nConsidering all these points, I would lean towards predicting high risk but with some consideration for the protective factors. The confidence level wouldn't be extremely high because not all indicators point definitively to high risk, but the arrest and conviction history are significant enough to tilt the balance.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
