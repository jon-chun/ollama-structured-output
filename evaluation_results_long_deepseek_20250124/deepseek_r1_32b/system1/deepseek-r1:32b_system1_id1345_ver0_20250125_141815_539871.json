    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze these risk factors for a 20-year-old Black female and determine if they indicate high risk. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once but not convicted. That might be a minor offense, so it's a red flag but not as severe without a conviction.\n\nShe has held two jobs in the past year. That shows some stability, which is positive.\n\nNo drug use in four years, which is good. However, she mentioned feeling down sometimes. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with higher risk if they're unaddressed or severe, but there's no indication here of substance abuse tied to that.\n\nShe lives alone and hasn't been married. Living alone isn't necessarily a bad sign; it could mean independence. But without knowing her support system, it's neutral.\n\nHigh school diploma but not in college. Education level can be a factor, but she has a diploma, which is better than not having one.\n\nUrban upbringing with biological dad in a household of four. Family structure and environment might have had some challenges, but again, without specifics on family dynamics or neighborhood crime rates, it's hard to gauge impact.\n\nShe considers God significant, which could indicate strong personal values or support from faith communities, possibly reducing risk factors.\n\nPutting this all together: the lack of a conviction, stable employment, no recent drug use, and positive indicators like education and religious belief suggest lower risk. The arrest is minor, living alone isn't negative, and while mental health could be a concern, there's no indication it's severe or leading to criminal behavior.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has a high school diploma and is not enrolled in college. She has held 2 jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up.
