    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's try to figure out whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. I'm not an expert, but I'll go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 20-year-old male who identifies as Black. Age might be a factor since younger individuals are sometimes more involved in criminal activities, though that's just a generalization. Race can sometimes correlate with systemic issues, but it's not a direct indicator of risk on its own.\n\nHe's been arrested eight times and has convictions. That seems significant. Multiple arrests and a conviction history could indicate a pattern of behavior that might be problematic. I think this is a strong point towards high risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'6\" and 150-174 lbs. Not sure how much this impacts risk, but maybe it's relevant for physical presence or something else. Doesn't seem like a major factor on its own.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone might mean less supervision or fewer accountability structures, which could be a risk factor. Never being married is neutral on its own but combined with other factors, it might contribute to higher risk.\n\nHas a GED and isn't enrolled in college. Education level can sometimes correlate with opportunities. A GED is good, but not continuing education might limit job prospects. That could lead to frustration or other issues if he's struggling financially.\n\nNo jobs in the past year. Unemployment can be a significant factor. Without steady employment, someone might turn to illegal activities out of necessity or because of limited options. This seems like a notable red flag.\n\nDrug use: marijuana in the past four years. Substance use can impair judgment and lead to other risky behaviors. Even if it's not hard drugs, regular marijuana use could indicate some level of risk.\n\nNo depression in the past month. That might be a positive sign since mental health issues can sometimes contribute to criminal behavior. So this factor is less concerning.\n\nGrowing up with his biological mother in an urban area, household size three. Family structure and environment can play roles. Urban areas might have higher crime rates, but that's more about environment than the individual. Growing up in a single-parent home could be a risk factor depending on other dynamics, but without more info, it's hard to say.\n\nBelieves God has nothing to do with personal events. Religious beliefs or lack thereof can sometimes correlate with values and decision-making. Some studies suggest that individuals without religious involvement might have different behavioral patterns, but this is speculative.\n\nPutting it all together: multiple arrests/convictions, unemployment, drug use, living alone, no further education beyond GED. These seem like substantial risk factors. The positive points are not being depressed and having a GED, but they don't outweigh the negatives in my view.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
