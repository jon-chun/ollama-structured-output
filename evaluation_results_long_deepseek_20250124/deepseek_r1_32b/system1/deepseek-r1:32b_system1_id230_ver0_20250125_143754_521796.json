    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this person is high risk based on the given factors. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male, white. Age-wise, 22 isn't too young anymore, but males in their early twenties can still be at a higher risk for certain behaviors compared to older individuals. Race might not directly indicate risk, but sometimes socioeconomic factors tied to race can play a role.\n\nHe's been arrested twice and has convictions. That's a significant point. Arrests and convictions are strong indicators of past criminal behavior, which could suggest a higher likelihood of future offenses. The number isn't extremely high, but having two arrests with convictions is notable.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'7\" and 168 lbs. I don't think this is a major factor in risk assessment unless there's something specific about his build that relates to criminal activity, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nNever married and living alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk because there's less supervision or support from others. Not being married might indicate lower stability compared to someone in a committed relationship.\n\nEducation: High school diploma and enrolled in a four-year college. Education generally is a protective factor against crime. Being in college suggests some level of responsibility and future orientation, which could mitigate risk.\n\nEmployment: Held one job during the year. Stable employment is another protective factor. However, only having one job might not provide enough economic stability, but it's still better than being unemployed or frequently changing jobs.\n\nDrug use: Used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a red flag. Both marijuana and cocaine are illicit drugs, with cocaine being particularly problematic due to its higher potential for addiction and associated crimes like theft or dealing.\n\nNo depression in the past month. Mental health issues can sometimes correlate with criminal behavior, but the absence of depression here might be a positive sign. However, other mental health factors weren't mentioned, so it's hard to say much about that.\n\nUpbringing: Lived with both biological parents in an urban area with a household size of five. Growing up in a two-parent home is generally protective, providing more supervision and stability. Urban areas can have higher crime rates, but the person was raised there, which might not directly indicate risk unless other factors are present.\n\nBelief in God: Considers that God has something to do with his personal life. Religious beliefs can sometimes act as a deterrent against criminal behavior because of moral guidelines and community support.\n\nPutting it all together: On one hand, he has protective factors like education, employment, stable upbringing, and religious beliefs. But the risk factors include prior arrests/convictions, substance abuse, living alone, and being single. The two convictions are particularly concerning as they show a history of criminal behavior. Substance use could lead to further issues or recidivism.\n\nI'm leaning towards high risk because of the past convictions and current drug use. These factors often indicate higher chances of future offenses. However, the protective factors might slightly lower the confidence level, but not enough to say it's low risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n   \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n   \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
