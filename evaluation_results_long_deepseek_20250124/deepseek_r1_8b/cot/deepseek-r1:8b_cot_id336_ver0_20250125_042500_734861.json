    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm going to try to figure out the likelihood of this 19-year-old being rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's a Black male, 5'10\" and 180 lbs. He's never been married and lives alone. Having a high school diploma but not in college might indicate some educational limitations. He's held two jobs this year, which is positive because it suggests he's working towards stability.\n\nHe has a history of drug use\u2014specifically marijuana\u2014but hasn't felt depressed recently. That could mean he's managing his substance use better now or perhaps using less. His background growing up in an urban area with a large household might have exposed him to higher crime influences, but without any convictions, it's hard to know.\n\nReligiously, he believes God plays a role in his life. I'm not sure how that ties into criminal behavior, but belief systems can influence decision-making and risk-taking behaviors.\n\nHe hasn't been convicted before, which is a good sign. Maybe he's gotten things under control. However, one arrest suggests he's encountered the legal system, which could be a red flag for future interactions.\n\nConsidering all these points, I don't have enough information to say it's high risk, but there are some concerning factors like past drug use and potential exposure to crime environments. He's working and not depressed now, which might lower the chances. So, maybe medium risk?\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"medium\", \"Black male, 5'10\\\" 180 lbs, never married, living alone, high school diploma, two jobs\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"arrested once, no convictions\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"used marijuana in the past four years\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"has not felt depressed over the past month\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"lived with biological mother in a household of five in an urban area\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"believes God has something to do with personal outcomes\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
