    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to assess the risk of this 18-year-old male being rearrested within three years. He's had six arrests and convictions, which is a significant factor. He's Hispanic, living alone, not married, and enrolled in school but hasn't held a job. His drug use in the past four years includes marijuana and cocaine. Recently, he's been feeling down, which might indicate higher risk. He grew up in an urban area with a big household, which could mean he didn't get enough supervision or support as a kid. He doesn't believe in God, which might contribute to his antisocial behaviors.\n\nFirst, age is a factor\u201418 is pretty young, and younger people often have higher recidivism rates because they're still developing. His criminal history is six arrests and convictions; that's a high number, so that's definitely a high risk factor.\n\nHis drug use in the past four years, especially recently feeling down, suggests he might be using more or dealing with emotional issues. Drug use often correlates with higher recidivism, so that's another high.\n\nHe's enrolled in school but hasn't held a job. School enrollment could indicate efforts to turn his life around, but without work experience, it might be harder for him to stabilize, increasing the risk.\n\nHe feels disconnected from God, which can contribute to higher risk behaviors because he might lack a support system or moral compass. That's medium.\n\nHis upbringing in an urban area with a large household\u2014big families in urban areas sometimes have higher crime rates due to lack of resources and supervision. That's also medium.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone, which can be both good and bad. Living alone might mean he has more freedom, but it could also lead to isolation or poor decision-making. That's a bit tricky, maybe medium.\n\nFeeling down recently indicates possible instability or emotional issues that could increase the risk of criminal behavior. So that's another medium factor.\n\nPutting it all together, his age, number of arrests, drug use, and feeling down are all high risk factors. His education and living situation are medium. Maybe I can assign each a weight: high for age, criminal history, drugs; medium for education, feeling down, and upbringing; low for nothing obvious.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Younger individuals often have higher recidivism rates due to ongoing development and higher risk-taking behaviors.\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: A history of six arrests and convictions significantly increases the likelihood of future rearrests\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Current drug use, particularly marijuana and cocaine, is a strong indicator of higher recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"school_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Enrollment in school may indicate efforts toward change but without job experience could lead to instability\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of belief in God can reduce inhibitions and contribute to antisocial behaviors\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing up in a large urban household may have contributed to higher risk factors\"),\n    (\"marital_status\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone without marriage does not inherently indicate high risk but could influence decision-making\"),\n    (\"current_emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent feelings of despair can indicate instability and increased risk of criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 145 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He is enrolled in school at the present moment. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area.
