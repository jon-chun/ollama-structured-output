    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the risk factors for this 20-year-old male who's been arrested once but not convicted. Let me break down each aspect of his situation step by step.\n\nFirst off, he's a White male, which might be relevant because some studies show racial disparities in criminal justice outcomes. But I'm not sure if that's a direct risk factor or just a contextual element.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 155 lbs. Not particularly tall or overweight, so physical stature doesn't seem to pose an immediate risk here. Maybe low or medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be associated with higher risk-taking behaviors because there's less accountability. That might lean towards a higher risk factor in terms of recidivism.\n\nHe has a high school diploma but isn't enrolled in college. Having a GED is generally positive, indicating he's at least educated enough to function, but not pursuing further education could be a negative in terms of job prospects and structured life, which can contribute to criminal behavior. So maybe medium risk here.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Stable employment is usually a good indicator for low recidivism because it provides structure and income. However, if he's held only two jobs, does that mean he's stable? Maybe, but perhaps the fact that he's been arrested once while holding these jobs could imply some issues with time management or stress. So maybe medium risk.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant factor. Regular drug use, especially of harder substances like cocaine, is often linked to higher recidivism rates. This seems like a high-risk factor because substance abuse can lead to criminal behavior and repeat offenses.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. A lack of depression could either be a protective factor or just not relevant. Without current mental health issues, maybe this isn't directly contributing to risk, so low or medium risk here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with both biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a stable family environment with both parents is generally protective against criminal behavior. However, urban areas can have higher crime rates and more exposure to negative influences. So maybe this is a protective factor, but the urban setting could be a risk. It's a bit conflicting, so perhaps medium risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. Religiosity can be a protective factor as it often correlates with lower criminal behavior due to moral beliefs and social support. This seems like a low or medium risk factor because it might reduce the likelihood of recidivism.\n\nPutting this all together, the biggest risk factors seem to be the drug use and living alone. Those are high impact areas. The employment is positive but not enough to offset the drug use. Family background is protective, but urban environment could add some risk. So I'd say each factor's weight as low, medium, or high accordingly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"White males may have contextual factors but not directly a risk factor\"),\n    (\"physical_stature\", \"low\", \"No direct correlation to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"high\", \"Living alone can increase risk-taking behaviors\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"GED is positive, no college enrollment may be negative\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"Stable employment is protective, job holding shows responsibility\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Regular drug use, especially cocaine, increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health_current\", \"low\", \"No depression in the past month not a direct risk factor\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Stable family is protective, urban area may pose risks\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can be protective against criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
