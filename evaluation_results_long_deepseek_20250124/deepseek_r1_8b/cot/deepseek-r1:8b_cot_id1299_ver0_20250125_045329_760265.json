    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for an 18-year-old Hispanic female who has been arrested three times and convicted. She's 5'6\", weighs 130 lbs, never married, lives alone, doesn't have a high school diploma or GED, isn't in college, held two jobs this year, used marijuana in the past four years, hasn't felt depressed recently, grew up in an urban area with a large household as a child, and believes God plays a role in her personal life. I need to assign low, medium, or high weights to each of these factors and then predict if she'll be rearrested within three years.\n\nFirst, I should list all the given factors and think about how each contributes to recidivism risk.\n\n1. Age: 18 years old is a young adult, so higher risk than an older adult.\n2. Gender: Female, which might have different sentencing patterns or risk factors compared to males, but not sure if it's a significant factor in recidivism.\n3. Hispanic identity: Could be a demographic factor that influences interactions with the criminal justice system, possibly medium weight.\n4. Criminal history: She has been arrested three times and convicted, indicating higher risk.\n5. Height and weight: 5'6\" and 130 lbs. Not sure how physical stats affect risk beyond what's in her criminal record.\n6. Marital status: Never married and living alone, might indicate instability but needs context.\n7. Education level: No diploma or GED, which is a strong indicator of higher risk due to lower socioeconomic status and reduced opportunities.\n8. Employment: Held two jobs this year, which suggests she's capable of holding down work, maybe indicating some stability, so low weight here.\n9. Drug use: Used marijuana in the past four years. Recent use could be a factor, but it's been four years, so maybe lower risk now unless there's more recent use.\n10. Depression: She hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate she's functioning well currently, so lower risk here.\n11. Family background: Grew up in a large urban household, which might contribute to higher risk due to possible negative influences or socioeconomic factors.\n12. Religion: Believes God has a role in her life, could be a protective factor if it provides support or structure, so maybe low weight.\n\nNow, assigning weights:\n\n- Criminal history: High\n- Education: High (low education is a big risk)\n- Family background: Medium to high (urban, large family might mean more exposure to crime)\n- Drug use: Maybe medium if recent, but she hasn't used recently, so lower\n- Employment: Low (holding jobs is positive)\n- Age: High\n- Marital status: Doesn't contribute much on its own\n- Religion: Could be low or high; if it's a strong factor, maybe medium\n- Others like gender, Hispanic identity, etc., might be considered as medium factors\n\nPutting this all together, the highest risks are criminal history and education. The family background adds some risk, age is a factor, and drug use could be medium but not too high since she hasn't used recently.\n\nSo, prediction would lean towards YES with high confidence because of the combination of these high-risk factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Number of prior arrests and convictions significantly increases recidivism risk.\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"Lack of diploma or GED often correlates with higher recidivism rates due to reduced socioeconomic opportunities.\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Growing up in a large, urban household may expose individuals to environments conducive to criminal behavior.\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"low\", \"Past marijuana use four years ago is less impactful unless recent usage exists.

She has been arrested 3 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 6 inches and weighs 130 lbs. She has never been married and is currently living alone.
