    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for a 21-year-old female who has been arrested once and convicted. Let's go through each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 21. Young adulthood is often associated with higher recidivism rates because it's a period of impulsive behavior. So this might be a medium risk factor.\n\nShe identifies as White. I'm not sure if race alone is a significant factor in recidivism without more context, so maybe low here.\n\nShe has been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction indicates some criminal history, which is a higher risk factor. So that's probably medium to high.\n\nHer height is 5'4\" and weight between 125-149 lbs. Body size doesn't directly correlate with recidivism, so I'll consider this low.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean she has more freedom, which could be a risk factor, maybe medium.\n\nEducation: She has a high school diploma and is in a two-year college. Education can buffer against criminal behavior, so that's a positive factor, likely low.\n\nEmployment history: She held four jobs this year. Stable employment reduces risk, so that's another low.\n\nDrug use: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent drug use increases recidivism risk, probably medium to high.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior; if she's not currently depressed, it might be a lower factor, maybe low.\n\nFamily background: Lived with her biological mother in an urban household of four. Urban areas may have higher crime rates, and large households can influence environment. So that's a medium risk.\n\nReligious beliefs: She considers God involved in her personal life. Religion can sometimes reduce recidivism by promoting values like honesty. So maybe low.\n\nPutting this all together, factors like prior conviction, drug use, urban background, and some others might tilt the scale towards higher risk. But I need to weigh them carefully.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"Young adulthood is often linked to higher recidivism due to impulsivity\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"Race alone without additional context may not significantly influence recidivism\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Prior arrest and conviction indicate existing criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"low\", \"Body size does not directly correlate with recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might increase freedom, which can be a risk factor\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Education may buffer against criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces risk of recidivism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Current lack of depression may not indicate high risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and family size can influence environment\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may promote values reducing criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
