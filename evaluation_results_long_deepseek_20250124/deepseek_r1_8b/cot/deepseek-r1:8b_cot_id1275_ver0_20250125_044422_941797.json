Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst off, she has no high school diploma or GED and isn't in college. That's a red flag because lower education levels are often linked to higher recidivism. I think that's a medium risk there.\n\nShe's Hispanic, which is an ethnic factor. I remember studies showing that racial minorities sometimes have different outcomes in the criminal justice system, so that might be medium too.\n\nShe's only been arrested once and convicted once. That's not a lot of history, so maybe low on criminal history.\n\nShe lives alone now, but she was raised in a household with her mom and two siblings. I'm not sure how that affects risk. Maybe the family structure could influence things, but it doesn't stand out as high or low. Maybe medium.\n\nShe's worked one job this year, which is positive. Employment can reduce the chance of recidivism, so that's a good sign\u2014low risk there.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use itself isn't a crime unless it's related to other charges, but history of substance abuse can be a risk factor. Maybe medium here.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed recently. Mental health is important; if she's not struggling now, maybe lower risk on that front.\n\nShe considers God involved in her life. Religiosity can be protective, so that might be low or medium. I'm not sure how much impact it has compared to other factors.\n\nConsidering all these, I think the highest risks are lack of education and drug use, both at medium. Her job and no depression are positives, lowering the risk. So overall, I'd say there's a medium risk she'll be rearrested in three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"education\", \"medium\", \"Lower education levels correlate with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Hispanic individuals may have different outcomes in the criminal justice system\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"low\", \"Limited criminal history suggests lower risk\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"Household size may influence social factors but more nuanced impact\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Employment can reduce recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"History of drug use increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"No depression indicates better mental health status\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may offer protective effects\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
