    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this individual to predict whether he'll be rearrested within three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, age is 22. Younger individuals generally have higher recidivism rates compared to older adults because they might lack the decision-making maturity. So, I think that's a high risk factor.\n\nHis ethnicity is Hispanic. I'm not sure how much demographic factors like ethnicity influence recidivism independently, but it can be related to systemic issues or community factors, so maybe medium risk.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior conviction suggests he's already shown willingness to reenter the justice system, which is a strong indicator for future rearrests. That should be high.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 180 lbs., but I don't see how physical characteristics directly affect recidivism much. Maybe low risk here.\n\nHe's married and living with his spouse. Having a stable family life can provide support and reduce the likelihood of criminal behavior, so that's a protective factor\u2014maybe medium to low, depending on other factors.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college. Education level can influence employment opportunities, which in turn affects criminal behavior. Since he isn't pursuing higher education, it might be a risk\u2014medium.\n\nHe's held two jobs this year. Stable employment is generally good for reducing recidivism because it provides structure and income. So that's a strong protective factor\u2014maybe low.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Recent substance use can be a risk factor, especially if it's ongoing. However, not feeling depressed might indicate he's managing stress effectively, so maybe medium.\n\nHe lived with non-biological parents as a child in a household of two. Growing up in a non-traditional family structure can sometimes increase the likelihood of delinquent behavior. That's another risk\u2014medium to high.\n\nHis lack of belief in God might affect his sense of accountability or social support, potentially increasing risk. This is more about personal beliefs, so maybe medium.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college, which ties back to education as a potential risk factor\u2014maybe medium.\n\nConsidering all these factors, I need to assign weights. The strongest predictors seem to be prior arrest and conviction (high), followed by age (high). Substance use (medium) and family structure (medium) also contribute. Employment (low) and spousal support (low) provide some protection. Education level (medium) is a bit neutral but could add risk.\n\nSo, I think the prediction would lean towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher recidivism rates due to lack of decision-making maturity\"),\n    (\"ethnicity\", \"medium\", \"Demographic factors can influence systemic issues affecting recidivism\"),\n    (\"prior_arrests\", \"high\", \"Previous arrest and conviction indicate potential for future rearrest\"),\n    (\"physical Characteristics\", \"low\", \"Physical attributes don't directly correlate with criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_status\", \"low\", \"Marriage and stable living provide support against criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"Lower education can increase risk through reduced employment opportunities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Stable employment reduces recidivism through structure and income\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"medium\", \"Recent substance use increases likelihood of rearrest\"),\n    (\"childhood_environment\", \"high\", \"Non-traditional upbringing can lead to higher delinquent behavior\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief may reduce social support and accountability\"),\n    (\"education_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Not enrolled in college may contribute to risk factors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
