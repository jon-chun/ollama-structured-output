    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to assess the risk factors for this individual's likelihood of being rearrested within three years. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.\n\nFirst, he's a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. His history includes six arrests and convictions, which is a significant indicator. His age might be a mitigating factor, but the number of prior arrests is high, so that's probably a medium to high risk factor.\n\nHe's 5'9\" and 180 lbs, which isn't particularly notable on its own, but combined with other factors, it might influence behavior choices.\n\nHe hasn't been married and lives alone, which can sometimes be associated with higher risk behaviors due to lack of accountability or support systems.\n\nHis education is a GED, not enrolled in college. Lack of further education can contribute to limited opportunities, potentially increasing recidivism risk.\n\nHe's unemployed, which might make it harder for him to find positive outlets and increase his chances of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nHe has used drugs recently\u2014marijuana and cocaine within the past four years. Current substance use is a strong indicator of higher risk as it often correlates with criminal behavior.\n\nHe's been feeling down lately, which could indicate emotional instability or stressors that might lead to negative coping mechanisms, such as crime.\n\nHis upbringing in a large urban household without biological parents suggests possible neglect or exposure to criminal influences early on, which can have long-term effects.\n\nHe believes in God's influence on his life. Religiosity can sometimes be protective, but if it's not actively involved, it might not provide the necessary support against recidivism.\n\nConsidering all these factors, substance use is a strong indicator (high), previous criminal history is also high. His education and employment status are low, which might contribute to higher risk. The emotional state and upbringing could be medium risks. Religiosity is unclear but might be a protective factor, so maybe low.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest risk factors are substance use and criminal history, each likely 'high'. The next tier includes education/employment as 'low', emotional state and upbringing as 'medium'. Religiosity might mitigate some risk, so perhaps 'low'.\n\nSo, factors would be:\n- Criminal History: High\n- Substance Use: High\n- Education/Employment: Low\n- Emotional State: Medium\n- Upbringing: Medium\n- Religiosity: Low\n\nPredicting a rearrest is likely, so I'd say \"YES\" with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Current drug use (marijuana and cocaine) is a strong predictor of criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"education_employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Lack of education and employment may contribute to limited opportunities, increasing risk\"),\n    (\"emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Feeling down may indicate stressors leading to negative coping mechanisms\"),\n    (\"upbringing\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Growing in a unstable environment increases risk exposure\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Belief in God may offer some protection if actively involved, but its current role is unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

He has been arrested 6 times and has been convicted. He is 5 feet 9 inches and weighs 180 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He has a GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year.
