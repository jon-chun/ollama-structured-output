    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out the likelihood of this 20-year-old White female being rearrested within three years. Let's break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, she has a history of arrest and conviction. That's a red flag because prior criminal history is often a strong predictor of future recidivism. I'll give that a high weight.\n\nShe's using substances like marijuana and cocaine recently, which increases the risk further. Drug use itself is a significant factor, so another high weight here.\n\nShe feels down and hopeless in the past month. This could mean she's experiencing emotional distress or instability, which might contribute to higher risk behaviors. I'll assign this as medium since it's not as direct as substance use but still concerning.\n\nShe has a stable job situation with three jobs, which is positive. Employment usually indicates better stability, so that's a protective factor and should be low weight.\n\nShe's enrolled in college, which suggests she's motivated to improve her life. Higher education can lower recidivism risk, so another low weight here.\n\nHer family background includes living with both parents in an urban area. Urban environments often have higher crime rates, and having both biological parents might provide some level of support, but the urban setting itself is a risk factor. I'll consider this as medium since it's about environment rather than personal factors.\n\nShe doesn't believe in God, which is a personal belief factor. Lack of spirituality can sometimes be associated with higher recidivism, so that's another medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together: her criminal history and drug use are high risks. The emotional distress adds some risk, and the protective factors like education and employment lower the overall risk. The family background and lack of spirituality might slightly increase the risk but not as much as the high-weighted factors.\n\nOverall, I think she has a moderate to high chance of being rearrested within three years. Her criminal history is the biggest factor here, followed closely by her substance use.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Having been arrested and convicted increases the likelihood of future recidivism\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Recent use of marijuana and cocaine contributes to higher risk\"),\n    (\"current_emotional_state\", \"medium\", \"Feeling down and hopeless may indicate instability or higher risk behavior\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Stable employment is a protective factor reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Being enrolled in college suggests motivation and lower recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Living in an urban area with both biological parents may increase exposure to negative influences but also provides some stability\"),\n    (\"spirituality\", \"medium\", \"Lack of belief in God can be associated with higher risk behaviors\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 20-year-old female who identifies herself as White. She has been arrested 1 time and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 1 inch and weighs 110 lbs. She has never been married and is currently not living alone. She has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. She has held 3 jobs during the year. She has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana and cocaine) and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with both of her biological parents in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to her personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
