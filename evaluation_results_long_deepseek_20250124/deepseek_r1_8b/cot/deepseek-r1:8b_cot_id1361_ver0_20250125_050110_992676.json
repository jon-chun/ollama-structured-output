    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 19-year-old male who has been arrested twice but not convicted. Let me break down each factor one by one.\n\nFirst, his demographic: he's a Black male, which is often associated with higher recidivism rates due to systemic issues and over-policing in certain communities. So that's probably a high risk factor.\n\nNext, his criminal history. He has two arrests but no convictions. While this might indicate he's not yet been convicted, it also suggests he's had some involvement with the justice system, which can increase the likelihood of future interactions.\n\nHis education level: he doesn't have a diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lower education levels are linked to higher recidivism because it limits job opportunities and can lead to economic struggles, which sometimes contribute to criminal behavior.\n\nEmployment status: He hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can be a significant stressor and may increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal activities as a means of coping or seeking fulfillment.\n\nDrug use: He has used marijuana in the past four years and was feeling down a lot recently. Drug use, especially marijuana, is often associated with higher recidivism rates. Additionally, his current emotional state could be a stressor that might lead to further issues.\n\nFamily background: Growing up in a household of seven in an urban area can mean exposure to environments with higher crime rates and possibly more significant challenges. Also, living with his biological mother might have had its own set of issues that contributed to his current situation.\n\nReligious beliefs: He believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes. While this could be a source of comfort or guidance, it's also possible that he may internalize responsibility in a way that affects his decision-making.\n\nPutting all these together, I'm leaning towards a high risk of rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"demographics\", \"high\", \"Black male demographic associated with higher recidivism\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Two arrests without conviction may indicate higher risk\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Low education level linked to increased recidivism\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Marijuana use and emotional distress may increase recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"medium\", \"Urban upbringing and large household may pose challenges\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"Belief in divine intervention may have mixed effects\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

Step back, take a deep breath and carefully think step by step to assign a relative weight [low, medium, high] to each risk factor before using them to collectively predict 3-year rearrest recidivism:\nThe person is a 19-year-old male who identifies himself as Black. He has been arrested 2 times but has not been convicted. He is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 170 lbs. He has never been married and is currently living alone. He does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. He has held no jobs during the year. He has used drugs in the past four years (marijuana) and most of the time during the past month he has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer him up. At a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 7, in an urban area. He considers that God has something to do with what happens to him personally.\n\nAfter your analysis, you must respond ONLY with a JSON object in exactly this format, with no additional text:\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"factor1\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"factor2\", \"low\"|\"medium\"|\"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\" or \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": number between 0 and 100\n}\n"
