    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the risk factors for this 22-year-old male who's been arrested once and convicted. Let me start by going through each part of his background.\n\nFirst, he's a Black male. I know that being Black often correlates with higher arrest rates, especially due to systemic issues in the criminal justice system. So that might be a medium or high risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED but isn't enrolled in college and hasn't held a job this year. Not having a job could mean he's more likely to engage in criminal activities for lack of structure or resources, so that's probably a medium risk.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years. Drug use can be a contributing factor to recidivism, but since it's only marijuana and he hasn't felt depressed recently, maybe that's lower impact. Still, it's a concern, so I'll consider it medium.\n\nHe grew up in a household with non-biological parents in an urban area. Living without family support, especially in an urban environment which often has higher crime rates, could increase his risk. That seems like a high risk factor.\n\nHe considers God as something personal happening to him. Religiosity can influence behavior, but I'm not sure how it affects recidivism. Maybe if it gives him structure or purpose, it could reduce risk, so that might be low.\n\nNo marriage or stable relationships, and he's living alone. Being alone without family support might increase his vulnerability, so that's a medium risk.\n\nHe hasn't been depressed recently but has in the past. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, so even if he's not currently depressed, past issues could still be a factor. Maybe low to medium.\n\nPutting it all together: being Black (medium), lack of education and job (medium), drug use (medium), unstable upbringing (high), religiosity (low), living alone (medium). So overall, high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Black individuals often face systemic issues leading to higher arrest rates\"),\n    (\"education_and_employment\", \"medium\", \"Lack of education and stable employment increases risk for criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"History of marijuana use can contribute to recidivism\"),\n    (\"household_background\", \"high\", \"Upbringing in unstable, non-family household in urban area increases vulnerability\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs can provide structure and reduce risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"Living alone without family support may increase criminal tendencies\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
