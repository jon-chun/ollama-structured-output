    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to assess the risk factors for this 22-year-old female who has a history of arrests and convictions. Let me start by going through each piece of information given.\n\nFirst, she's mixed race, which might relate to socioeconomic factors or systemic issues, but how significant is that in terms of recidivism? Not sure yet.\n\nShe has a GED, not enrolled in college. That could be a protective factor because education can reduce crime rates, so maybe low risk here.\n\nShe's been arrested 7 times and convicted, which suggests she's had multiple interactions with the justice system. Higher number might mean higher risk.\n\nShe's living alone after being divorced. Independence can sometimes lead to stress or higher risk behavior, but it's also a sign of maturity. Not certain.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in four years. That's positive because substance abuse is linked to criminal behavior, so maybe lower risk here.\n\nShe feels really down most of the time. Depression can increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism. So this could be high risk.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of three. A larger family might provide more support or possibly more chaos. Not sure how that ties into recidivism.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. Religiosity can influence behavior; some studies show it reduces crime. Maybe medium risk here.\n\nHer employment: held two jobs, which is a positive indicator of stability. More gainful employment usually correlates with lower recidivism, so maybe low risk.\n\nHeight and weight: 5'4\" and 139 lbs. Not sure how that ties in, but maybe smaller build isn't associated with higher violence risks? Or maybe not relevant at all.\n\nPutting it all together, factors like criminal history (high), current emotional state (high), substance use (low), education (low), employment (low), and religiosity (medium). The highest weights are on criminal history and her emotional state. So prediction is yes with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Multiple arrests and convictions indicate a higher likelihood of recidivism\"),\n    (\"depression\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Feelings of being down could lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No drug use in four years reduces risk associated with substance abuse\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: GED suggests some education, potentially reducing recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Holding two jobs indicates stability and lower criminal involvement likelihood\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Belief in God's influence may reduce crime but could also complicate behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Larger family background doesn't directly correlate with recidivism risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
