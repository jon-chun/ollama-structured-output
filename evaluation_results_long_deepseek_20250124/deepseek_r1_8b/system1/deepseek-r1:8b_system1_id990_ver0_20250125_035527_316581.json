    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I need to determine if this person indicates a high risk based on the given risk factors. Let me break down each factor one by one and assess them.\n\nFirst, she's an 18-year-old female, which is pretty young. Younger individuals can sometimes have higher risk factors due to impulsivity and less decision-making experience.\n\nShe identifies as White, but her race might not be the most significant factor here unless there's a history of systemic issues in that demographic. However, it's just one aspect among many.\n\nShe's been arrested once but not convicted. A prior arrest without a conviction is concerning because it suggests she has engaged in behavior that could lead to legal trouble, even if she hasn't been formally convicted yet. This might indicate higher risk compared to someone with no criminal history.\n\nHer physical description includes being 5'7\" and between 175-199 lbs. While her weight isn't directly a risk factor, it can sometimes be associated with health issues or other behaviors that might contribute to higher risk in assessments.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone at 18 might indicate she doesn't have strong family support or supervision, which could be a risk factor as she's more likely to engage in high-risk activities without oversight.\n\nShe is enrolled in school, which is positive but might also mean she's more involved in social activities that could lead to risks like drug use or other behaviors. Being in school doesn't automatically negate risk factors.\n\nShe has held two jobs this year. Employment can be a stabilizing factor, but it's also possible her work allows for more disposable income, which might contribute to higher-risk behaviors like substance use.\n\nShe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Current drug use is a significant red flag as it directly relates to criminal justice risks, including potential future arrests or involvement in the criminal justice system.\n\nShe hasn't felt depressed in the past month. While depression isn't always a risk factor, feeling sad or hopeless can sometimes lead to higher-risk behaviors, so her current mental state might not be a protective factor here.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of four. A larger family household is generally more stable and could provide better support, which might mitigate some risks. However, if the household had issues, that's another story, but without specifics, it's hard to assess.\n\nShe doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personal life. Atheism or lack of religious belief isn't inherently a risk factor, but sometimes people who don't have strong beliefs might not seek support from religious communities, which could affect their social connections and support networks.\n\nPutting all this together: she's young, has a history of drug use, was arrested once, lives alone without a stable family structure nearby, and is engaging in behaviors that could lead to further legal issues. These factors collectively increase her risk profile.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
