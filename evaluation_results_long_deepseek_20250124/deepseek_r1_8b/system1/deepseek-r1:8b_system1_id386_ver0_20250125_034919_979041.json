    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze these risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let's go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. Age can be a factor; younger individuals might have higher risk potential due to impulsivity or lack of experience in decision-making.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. Arrest history without a conviction doesn't automatically mean high risk, but it's still relevant because prior arrests can indicate behavior patterns that could lead to further issues.\n\nHis physical description is 6'4\" and 157 lbs. Not sure how much this contributes, as physical build isn't directly linked to criminal risk factors.\n\nHe has never been married and is not living alone. Living with others might provide more structure or supervision, which could lower risk compared to living independently without such support.\n\nHe doesn't have a high school diploma or GED and isn't enrolled in college. Lack of education can be a significant factor as it's linked to higher unemployment rates and difficulty in securing stable employment, which can increase stress and risk-taking behaviors.\n\nHe has held 4 jobs in the year. Stable employment is generally positive, indicating responsibility and routine, which might mitigate some risks.\n\nHe has used drugs (marijuana) in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Recent drug use could be concerning, especially if it's ongoing. However, not feeling depressed in the past month might suggest he's functioning well currently.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of 4 in a rural area. Growing up in a large family might provide some support or influence his behavior patterns. Rural areas can sometimes have different social dynamics that might affect risk.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a sense of control over events or a belief system that might influence his decision-making, possibly leading to more predictable behaviors.\n\nPutting it all together: He's young, hasn't been convicted but has an arrest record. He lacks formal education, which can be a risk factor. He has stable employment, which is positive. He's using drugs recently, which is concerning. His upbringing and belief system add layers that could either help or hinder his behavior.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like there are some red flags but not enough to definitively say high risk without more information. The lack of a criminal history beyond an arrest and the current stable employment might lower the overall risk compared to someone with a history of convictions.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
