    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I'm trying to analyze this risk factors assessment for a 21-year-old female who identifies as Black. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested once and convicted, which is a red flag. Previous convictions can indicate higher risk of recidivism, especially without any known interventions or completions of rehabilitation programs.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and between 150-174 lbs, which isn't particularly concerning on its own. Physical stature doesn't directly correlate with criminal behavior, so I'll note that but move on.\n\nShe hasn't married yet and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a risk factor if there are fewer supports in place, but it's not conclusive.\n\nHer educational background is limited\u2014no high school diploma or GED, and she's not enrolled in college. Lack of education can contribute to higher risk, especially when combined with other factors like unemployment or substance use.\n\nShe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to financial stress, which might increase the likelihood of criminal behavior as a coping mechanism.\n\nSubstance use is another key point: she's used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years, and in the past month, felt down on herself. Drug use itself is a risk factor, and feeling down or having mood issues can sometimes lead to more severe mental health struggles, which might escalate criminal behavior or self-harm.\n\nShe lived with her biological mother in an urban area as a young child. Growing up in a large household in an urban environment can expose individuals to different stressors and influences, potentially leading to higher risk behaviors.\n\nHer religious beliefs about God's influence on her personal life could be both protective or risky, depending on how she processes life events. It might offer some coping mechanisms but could also lead to decisions influenced by religious values that others might view as criminal.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: past legal issues, substance use, unemployment, lack of education, possible mood issues, and a potentially challenging upbringing. These elements collectively suggest a higher likelihood of reoffending or engaging in criminal behavior again.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
