The response was \"NO\" with a confidence level of 85.\n\nFirst, let's break down each factor:\n\n1. **Demographics**: She's a 21-year-old Hispanic female living alone, single, and hasn't completed high school or GED. This could be a risk factor as educational attainment can influence criminal behavior.\n\n2. **Criminal History**: One arrest and conviction. While this is a point against her, it's limited, suggesting she may not have extensive criminal history.\n\n3. **Employment**: She held one job last year, indicating some stability but might not be sufficient for higher risk.\n\n4. **Drug Use**: She used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Recent use can be linked to higher risk behaviors.\n\n5. **Mental Health**: She hasn't felt depressed recently, which is a positive sign.\n\n6. **Family Background**: Lived with her mother in a household of three. Family structure can impact behavior but doesn't alone indicate high risk.\n\n7. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God plays a role in her personal life. This could be a protective factor as religious beliefs sometimes correlate with lower criminality.\n\n8. **Lifestyle Factors**: Living alone and not enrolled in college might contribute to higher risk, especially if she's not in a supportive environment.\n\nConsidering all factors, while there are some red flags like drug use and limited education, the absence of recent depression, one prior conviction, and some stability (holding a job) suggest that her overall risk isn't extremely high. The confidence level is 85%, meaning it's moderately high but not certain.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
