    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to analyze this set of risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male who identifies as White. That's a demographic factor, but it alone isn't indicative of high risk. However, his age might be considered a risk factor since younger individuals can sometimes engage in higher-risk behaviors due to immaturity or impulsivity.\n\nHe has been arrested once and convicted. An arrest and conviction are strong indicators of past criminal behavior, which suggests he has engaged in illegal activities before. This is a significant risk factor as it indicates a history of law violations.\n\nHis physical description includes being 5 feet 2 inches and weighing 120 lbs. While body type isn't directly related to risk factors, his height could be relevant if considering factors like vulnerability or access to certain situations, but it's not a primary concern here.\n\nHe has never been married and is currently not living alone. Living with others might provide support or supervision, which can influence behavior. However, this alone doesn't point towards high risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a two-year college. Educational attainment often correlates with lower crime rates, as education provides structure and opportunities. His enrollment in college is a positive indicator, suggesting he's pursuing further education, which might reduce his risk of engaging in criminal activities.\n\nHe has held one job during the year. Employment is another positive factor. Having a job can provide stability and financial security, which are protective against criminal behavior.\n\nHe hasn't used any drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed over the past month. The lack of recent drug use is a positive sign, indicating he's moving away from high-risk behaviors like substance abuse. Additionally, not feeling depressed recently suggests he's managing his mental health effectively, which can be a protective factor.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in a household of size 5 in an urban area. Growing up in a large family, especially in an urban environment, might expose him to different stressors or influences. However, having a supportive family structure can also mitigate risk factors.\n\nHe considers that God has nothing to do with what happens to him personally. This indicates a lack of spiritual or belief-based support, which could be a risk factor as it suggests he may not have access to certain protective social supports.\n\nPutting this all together, the most significant risk factors are his history of arrest and conviction, indicating past criminal behavior. The positive factors like current employment, education, no recent drug use, and mental health stability suggest he's taking steps to lead a more responsible life. However, the lack of belief in a higher power might contribute to a sense of isolation or lack of support, which could pose some risk.\n\nConsidering these points, while there are positive indicators, the arrest history is a strong predictor of recidivism. Therefore, the overall assessment leans towards high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
