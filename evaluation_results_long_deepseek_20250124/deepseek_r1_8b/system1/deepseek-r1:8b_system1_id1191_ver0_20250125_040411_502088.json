    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. I'm trying to determine if the given risk factors indicate a high risk based on the provided response.\n\nFirst, the person is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. Being young and male might be a factor, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested twice and convicted, which suggests some criminal history. Two arrests could mean he's at higher risk compared to someone without any history, but it's early in his life, so it's not clear if this will escalate.\n\nHis physical description includes being 5'9\" and 152 lbs. Not particularly indicative of anything related to risk assessment in this context.\n\nHe hasn't married yet and lives alone. Living alone might be common for someone his age and doesn't immediately point towards higher risk.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Having only completed high school could affect job prospects, possibly increasing stress or dissatisfaction, which might relate to criminal behavior.\n\nHe's held one job during the year, so he's employed but not extensively. This might indicate some stability, though if he's underemployed, it could contribute to higher risk factors like frustration or financial stress.\n\nHe has used marijuana in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. Recent drug use can be a concerning factor, especially if it's ongoing. However, not feeling depressed in the past month might mitigate that risk slightly.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with his biological mother in an urban area as part of a household of five. Growing up in a large family, possibly in an urban environment, could mean exposure to different influences or stressors. Urban areas often have higher crime rates, so this is a relevant factor.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with what happens to him personally. This could indicate a sense of control or destiny, which might influence his behavior in certain ways. It's not clear if this would contribute positively or negatively towards criminal risk.\n\nConsidering all these factors together, the presence of criminal history and living in an urban area are significant. However, he hasn't been arrested recently and doesn't report feeling depressed, which could lower the immediate risk compared to someone with more severe mental health indicators.\n\nI'm a bit torn because while there are some concerning factors like prior arrests and the urban upbringing, there's also some stability in his current situation. He has employment, isn't using drugs right now, and isn't reporting depression, which might indicate he's managing these issues or has taken steps to improve his situation.\n\nGiven this balance, I'm leaning towards a moderate risk rather than high. High risk would typically involve more severe or persistent factors like significant criminal history, ongoing substance abuse, or major mental health issues. Here, the presence of arrests and urban background is concerning, but without more recent activity and with some positive indicators (like employment and no current depression), it's not enough to classify as high risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
