    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, let me try to work through this risk assessment step by step. So, I'm supposed to analyze the given risk factors and determine if they indicate a high risk. The response needs to be a JSON object with \"prediction\" as either \"YES\" or \"NO\" and a confidence score between 0 and 100.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the risk factors provided:\n\n1. **Age**: 21-year-old female.\n2. **Race**: Identifies as White.\n3. **Arrest History**: Arrested twice, with convictions.\n4. **Physical Build**: 5'5\" and 140 lbs.\n5. **Marital Status**: Divorced.\n6. **Living Situation**: Living alone.\n7. **Education Level**: No high school diploma or GED, not enrolled in college.\n8. **Employment**: No jobs during the year.\n9. **Drug Use**: Hasn't used drugs in the past four years but felt down recently.\n10. **Family Background**: Lived with biological mother in a household of 4 in an urban area as a young child.\n11. **Religious Beliefs**: Believes God plays a role in her personal life.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate each of these factors and see how they contribute to assessing risk, likely in the context of recidivism or reoffending probability.\n\nStarting with age: 21 is considered an adult and may have more criminal opportunities. Younger people can sometimes be more impulsive, which might increase risk.\n\nArrest history: Two arrests and convictions suggest she has engaged in criminal behavior before. This is a strong indicator of higher risk.\n\nPhysical build isn't directly related to criminal risk but could affect how she's perceived or how the courts might sentence her.\n\nMarital status: Divorced can sometimes be a stress factor, possibly contributing to criminal behavior if other factors are present.\n\nLiving alone: Could indicate isolation or lack of support, which might increase risk.\n\nEducation and employment: Lack of education and no job means limited opportunities and possible financial stress. Without job skills, it's harder to find legal income, which can drive criminal activity.\n\nDrug use: She hasn't used drugs in four years but was feeling down recently. This could mean she's at risk for relapse or other negative behaviors if stressors arise.\n\nFamily background: Growing up in a large household in an urban area might have exposed her to different environments, including potential crime influences.\n\nReligious beliefs: Believing God is involved can be a coping mechanism or may lead to different decision-making processes, but it's unclear how this directly affects risk.\n\nPutting this together, the key factors are the two convictions and arrest history, coupled with limited education and employment. These indicate she might have fewer barriers to reoffending, such as a lack of structured activity or support. The fact that she has a recent bout of feeling down could also be a stressor that increases risk.\n\nI'm not sure about the exact confidence score, but considering the arrest history is a strong predictor, I'd estimate high confidence in this assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",

She has been arrested 2 times and has been convicted. She is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 140 lbs. She is divorced and is currently living alone. She does not have a high school diploma or GED certificate and is not enrolled in college. She has held no jobs during the year. She has not used any drugs in the past four years and some of the time during the past month she has felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer her up. At a young age, she lived with her biological mother in a household of size 4, in an urban area. She considers that God has something to do with what happens to her personally.\n"
