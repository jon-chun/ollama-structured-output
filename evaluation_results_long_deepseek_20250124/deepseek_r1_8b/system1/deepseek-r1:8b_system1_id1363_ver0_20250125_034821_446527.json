    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze this person's risk factors to determine if they indicate a high risk. Let me go through each factor step by step.\n\nThe individual is a 22-year-old male identifying as Black. That's a demographic factor that could be associated with higher risk in some contexts, but it's not definitive on its own.\n\nHe has been arrested six times and convicted, which suggests he has a history of legal involvement. Multiple arrests and convictions are strong indicators of higher risk, especially if they relate to violent or chronic offenses.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight 180 lbs., which doesn't seem particularly relevant unless it's in the context of physical danger, but that's not mentioned here.\n\nHe has never been married and lives alone. Living alone can sometimes be a red flag, especially if there's a history of impulsive behavior or substance abuse, as he might have more freedom to engage in risky activities without oversight.\n\nHe only has a GED and isn't enrolled in college, which might indicate educational limitations that could contribute to higher risk factors like unemployment or socioeconomic instability.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year, which is concerning. Unemployment can lead to financial stress and may increase the likelihood of engaging in criminal behavior or substance use as a coping mechanism.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years, specifically marijuana and cocaine. Recent drug use can be a significant risk factor, especially if there's current or past criminal history related to drug offenses. His recent use within the past month indicates that his substance use is still active, which could pose immediate risks.\n\nHe feels down in the dumps recently, unable to find cheer, which suggests emotional distress. Emotional instability can sometimes lead to higher-risk behaviors, such as violence or self-harm, though that's not directly mentioned here.\n\nAt a young age, he lived with non-biological parents in an urban area. Growing up in a unstable or chaotic environment increases the risk of exposure to criminal influences and may contribute to behavioral issues later in life.\n\nHe believes God has something to do with his personal outcomes, which might be interpreted as a lack of personal responsibility or an external locus of control. This could affect his behavior if he sees his actions as beyond his control, potentially leading to higher-risk behaviors.\n\nConsidering all these factors together: arrest history, current drug use, unemployment, educational limitations, living alone, and adverse childhood experiences point towards a high risk. The combination of criminal history with ongoing substance abuse and potential emotional instability makes this person a high risk for further negative outcomes.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}\n```",
