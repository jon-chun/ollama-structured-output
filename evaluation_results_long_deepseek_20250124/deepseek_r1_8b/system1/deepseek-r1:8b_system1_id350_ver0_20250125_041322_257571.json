    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze this risk factors assessment for someone who's a 22-year-old White female. Let me go through each point step by step.\n\nFirst, she's been arrested twice but not convicted. That might indicate some behavioral issues or interactions with the legal system, which could be a red flag. However, since she hasn't been convicted, it doesn't necessarily mean she has a history of severe criminal behavior.\n\nShe's 5'6\" and weighs 190 lbs. Physical build can sometimes be a factor in risk assessments, but I'm not sure how significant that is here unless there's more context about past behaviors or offenses related to her physical size.\n\nShe hasn't been married and is not living alone, which might suggest she has family support or is in a stable environment. Living with others could provide social support, reducing some risks associated with criminal behavior.\n\nShe only has a high school diploma and isn't enrolled in college. Limited education can sometimes be a risk factor, but it's also a common situation among people her age. It might indicate she's not pursuing further education or career advancement, which could relate to future choices that might pose risks.\n\nShe held one job during the year. Employment is generally a positive indicator as it suggests she has some stability and structure in her life. People with jobs tend to have lower risk factors associated with criminal behavior because they're more integrated into society and have routine.\n\nShe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and hasn't felt depressed recently. This is positive because substance abuse and mental health issues are often linked to higher risks of criminal behavior. Her current lack of drug use and good mental health could lower her risk compared to others with those issues.\n\nAt a young age, she lived with both parents in a household of six. Growing up in a large family might provide her with strong social supports or influence her behavior positively. Larger families can offer more guidance and supervision, which might reduce the likelihood of criminal activity.\n\nShe believes God has something to do with her personal outcomes. This could be seen as a form of religious belief, which is generally benign unless it's linked to extremist views. Without evidence of any negative ideological tendencies, this factor doesn't pose a significant risk.\n\nPutting all these together: she has some arrests but no convictions, which isn't the highest risk. She has stable living arrangements and employment, which are positives. Her recent lack of substance abuse and good mental health further mitigate risks. Growing up in a supportive family environment also helps. Without any current indicators of severe criminal tendencies or high-risk behaviors, her overall risk seems low.\n\nI should consider whether her arrests involved minor offenses that don't reflect higher risk factors. If the arrests were for nonviolent or low-level crimes, they might not indicate a high risk. Since she hasn't been convicted, it's possible she was charged but not found guilty, or maybe the charges were dropped.\n\nOverall, while there are some red flags like arrests and limited education, the presence of employment, stable living, good mental health, and supportive family background suggest that her risk isn't particularly high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
