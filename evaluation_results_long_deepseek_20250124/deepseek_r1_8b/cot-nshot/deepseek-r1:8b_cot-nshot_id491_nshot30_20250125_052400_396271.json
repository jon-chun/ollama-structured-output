    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out whether this person is likely to be rearrested within the next three years. Let's break down each factor step by step.\n\nFirst, age is 20. From the examples given, younger individuals seem more likely to reoffend. For instance, an 18-year-old had multiple arrests and was convicted. So, being 20 might still be on the lower end where recidivism rates are higher.\n\nNext, he's White. Looking at the examples, it seems that both races have varying outcomes, but there's no clear trend suggesting a significant difference based solely on race in terms of recidivism.\n\nHe's been arrested once but not convicted. From the data, being arrested without conviction doesn't necessarily predict recidivism. However, having an arrest record can still contribute to future criminal behavior.\n\nHis weight and height are 145 lbs at 5'9\". That falls within a healthy weight range, which isn't directly indicative of criminal behavior. So, I don't think this factor plays a role here.\n\nHe's never been married and is not living alone. From the examples, living alone didn't seem to impact recidivism much. Being single might have some implications, but without more info, it's hard to say. It could mean he lacks support systems, which could increase risks.\n\nNot having a high school diploma or GED is a significant factor. Most of the examples where this person had no education led to higher recidivism rates, especially those with multiple arrests and convictions. So, lacking an education probably increases the risk.\n\nHe's not enrolled in college and hasn't held a job for long. Unemployment can be a contributing factor to criminal behavior as people may feel disconnected or have fewer opportunities. His job history is minimal, which could point towards higher recidivism.\n\nHe hasn't used drugs in the past four years and isn't depressed now. From the examples, current sobriety and mental health didn't seem directly tied to recidivism, but substance abuse was a common factor among those who were rearrested. His clean record here might lower his immediate risk compared to others.\n\nHe lived with his biological father in a household of size 4 in a rural area. Family structure can influence behavior; having both parents present may provide better support. However, in the examples, living arrangements didn't always correlate with recidivism outcomes clearly.\n\nHe believes God has control over his life. Religiosity isn't directly linked to criminal behavior, but belief systems can influence decision-making. It might help in desistance if it provides a framework for positive change.\n\nPutting this all together: He's young, has some risk factors like lack of education and being single, but hasn't been convicted yet. His clean drug use and mental health might mitigate some risks compared to others. However, his lack of education and possible disconnection from societal support systems could still pose a moderate risk.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"Age\", \"high\", \"Youthful age is associated with higher recidivism rates\"),\n    (\"Race\", \"medium\", \"Race doesn't consistently predict recidivism outcomes\"),\n    (\"Arrest History\", \"medium\", \"One arrest without conviction may indicate prior behavior\"),\n    (\"Physical Health\", \"low\", \"Normal weight and health don't directly correlate to recidivism\"),\n    (\"Marital Status\", \"medium\", \"Single and not living alone may increase risk through lack of support\"),\n    (\"Education Level\", \"high\", \"Lack of education significantly increases recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"Employment Status\", \"medium\", \"Unemployment can contribute to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"Drug Use\", \"low\", \"Clean drug use lowers immediate risk compared to users\"),\n    (\"Mental Health\", \"low\", \"Current lack of depression may not directly impact recidivism\"),\n    (\"Family Structure\", \"low\", \"Supportive family environment may reduce risk\"),\n    (\"Religiosity\", \"medium\", \"Belief systems can influence behavior but effect is unclear\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 65\n}\n```",
