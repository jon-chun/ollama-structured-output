    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the likelihood that this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of their factors one by one and see how they compare to the examples provided.\n\nFirst off, age is a big factor. The person is 19, which is pretty young. Looking at the examples, younger individuals tend to have higher recidivism rates. For instance, in example #27, an 18-year-old had several factors but still ended up with \"NO\". However, being 19 might be slightly better than 18, but it's still quite low.\n\nNext, criminal history. He has been arrested once and convicted. In the examples, people with higher numbers of arrests and convictions often have higher recidivism rates. For example, in example #29, someone with 17 arrests had \"NO\". But this person only has one arrest, which is lower than most examples but not too bad either.\n\nHis current offense isn't specified beyond being arrested once and convicted. If it's a nonviolent crime, that might help reduce the likelihood compared to violent offenses.\n\nHe lives alone now, which is a positive factor because often people with stable living situations have better outcomes. In example #27, living alone didn't necessarily help, but in other cases like example #30, it did.\n\nHe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in college. Education is a strong indicator of lower recidivism. College enrollment suggests he's working towards something positive, which reduces the chances he'll reoffend.\n\nHe held two jobs this year, which shows he's actively contributing to society through work. Stable employment is linked to lower recidivism rates, so that's another positive factor.\n\nHe has used drugs in the past four years\u2014marijuana and cocaine. Drug use is a significant risk factor. In examples, drug use often correlated with higher recidivism, but it also depends on whether he's seeking treatment. Since this isn't mentioned, I assume he might still be using them, increasing his risk.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed over the past month. Mental health issues can contribute to recidivism, so not having recent depression is a plus. But without knowing if there are other mental health issues, it's hard to say.\n\nHe lived with both parents in a household of size 4 as a young adult. Family support can be beneficial, but since he now lives alone, that might indicate he's more independent, which could be either good or bad depending on the context.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with his circumstances. Religious beliefs can sometimes lead to better outcomes if they provide structure and support, but it's not a guarantee.\n\nComparing all these factors, I think some of them are strong positives (education, employment) while others are moderate risks (criminal history, drug use). He doesn't have any recent mental health issues or major problems with living situation now. His age is on the lower side, but he has some positive indicators that could mitigate his risk.\n\nIn the examples provided, people with similar factors often had \"NO\" outcomes, especially those with higher education and stable living. However, considering his criminal history and drug use, there's still a moderate risk of recidivism.\n\nI would assign low to medium weight to each factor except maybe the criminal history and drug use, which could be medium or high. But since he only has one arrest, maybe it's on the lower side. Drug use is definitely a significant factor but not necessarily a deal-breaker if other factors are positive.\n\nPutting this all together, I think his chances of being rearrested in three years are low to moderate. Given that he's working, going to college, and has stable living, those are strong indicators against recidivism. The risk factors like drug use and past criminal history might increase it a bit but not too much.\n\nSo, my prediction is \"NO\" for rearrest within three years, with some confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Young age slightly increases risk\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: One conviction moderately increases risk\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Living alone is a positive factor\"),\n    (\"education\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: College enrollment significantly reduces risk\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"high\", \"Textual reasoning: Stable employment reduces risk\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"Textual reasoning: Recent drug use moderately increases risk\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: No recent depression is a positive factor\"),\n    (\"family_support\", \"low\", \"Textual reasoning: Family support as a child, but currently lives alone\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"NO\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
