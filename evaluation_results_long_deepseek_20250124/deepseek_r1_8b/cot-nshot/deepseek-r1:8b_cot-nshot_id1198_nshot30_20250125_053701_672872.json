    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to predict whether this individual will be rearrested within the next three years. Let's go through each risk factor one by one and assign a weight based on the examples provided.\n\n1. **Arrest History**: He has been arrested twice but not convicted. From the examples, it seems that being arrested multiple times is a significant factor. For instance, in Example 28, being arrested seven times led to a \"YES\" prediction. So, I'll give this a high weight.\n\n2. **Age**: He's 20 years old, which is younger and might be more prone to further arrests compared to older individuals. Looking at the examples, age didn't directly correlate but being younger could increase risk. Medium weight seems appropriate here.\n\n3. **Race**: He identifies as Black. In the given examples, race sometimes played a role in the prediction. For example, Example 27 involved a Black individual who wasn't rearrested. However, it's hard to determine if race itself is a direct factor or just correlated with other variables. Maybe medium weight.\n\n4. **Employment**: He has held 1 job this year. In Example 28, holding jobs didn't prevent arrest. Maybe having employment is neutral or slightly positive, but without more info, I'll consider it low.\n\n5. **Drug Use**: He hasn't used drugs in the past four years. From examples, current drug use seemed to increase rearrest risk. Since he's clean now, this might lower his risk. So, medium weight for this factor.\n\n6. **Mental Health**: He hasn't felt depressed recently. The example (Example 27) where someone was feeling down led to \"NO\". So, not being depressed might be a positive sign. I'll give it a low weight.\n\n7. **Household Size**: He lived in a household of size 3 growing up. In Example 28, larger households didn't directly influence the outcome much. Maybe medium weight since family structure can impact behavior.\n\n8. **Religious Beliefs**: He believes God influences his life. Examples showed that religious beliefs sometimes influenced outcomes ambiguously. I'll give it a low weight.\n\n9. **Crimination Factors**: He's never been convicted, which is positive. In the examples, being unconvicted sometimes led to \"YES\" (like Example 28). So, this might be a strong protective factor, giving it high weight.\n\n10. **Living Situation**: He's living alone now. From the examples, living arrangements didn't always predict outcomes clearly. Maybe medium weight.\n\n11. **Education Level**: He has a high school diploma. Examples showed mixed results for education. Maybe medium weight as having an education might reduce risk.\n\n12. **Job Stability**: He held 1 job, indicating some stability. If he's holding a job, that's a positive sign, so low to medium weight.\n\nPutting it all together, the highest weights are Arrest History and Criminal Record. These are the most significant factors in recidivism. The other factors are secondary but less impactful.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"religion\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"criminal_record\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_arrangements\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"job_stability\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 80\n}\n```",
