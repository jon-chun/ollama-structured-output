    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, I need to determine whether the person described will be rearrested within the next three years based on the given risk factors. First, I'll go through each of the provided examples to see if there's a pattern or commonalities that can help me assess this case.\n\nLooking at Examples 1-30, it seems like several factors contribute to recidivism: prior arrests and convictions, substance abuse, unstable living conditions, lack of education or employment, and social beliefs like those regarding religion. Each factor's weight might influence the prediction.\n\nFor this specific case, the person is an 18-year-old White male with a history of being arrested three times and convicted. He's living alone, hasn't completed high school, has held two jobs recently, uses marijuana, and feels down at times. He also comes from a large household (size 7) and holds beliefs that might influence his behavior.\n\nI need to assign weights: low, medium, or high. Let's go through each factor:\n\n1. **Arrest History**: He has been arrested three times and convicted. High weight because prior convictions are strong predictors of recidivism.\n2. **Employment**: Held two jobs\u2014medium, as stable employment can reduce risk but not as much as education or skills.\n3. **Substance Abuse**: Uses marijuana regularly\u2014high weight since substance abuse is a significant factor for rearrest.\n4. **Mental Health**: He feels down sometimes\u2014medium, as mental health issues can contribute but might not be the primary driver here unless more severe issues are present.\n5. **Living Situation**: Living alone might increase risk slightly due to less supervision\u2014medium.\n6. **Education Level**: Doesn't have a high school diploma\u2014high weight since lack of education is a strong predictor.\n7. **Household Size**: Growing up in a large household\u2014low, as larger families may offer more support or structure.\n\nNow, considering all factors, substance abuse and prior arrests are highly weighted towards recidivism. Without more info on mental health severity, it's medium. So, the prediction leans towards YES with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"arrest_history\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"substance_abuse\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"high\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"medium\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"textual reasoning\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 90\n}\n```",
