    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to predict whether this person will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me start by going through each of her background factors and assigning a weight to them based on past examples.\n\nFirst, her age is 21, which is on the younger side. From the examples provided, it seems like younger individuals have higher recidivism rates. Maybe I should give that a medium weight because being young can lead to more impulsive decisions.\n\nNext, she's White. The examples didn't show a clear pattern based on race, so maybe I can consider that as low or medium. Since there wasn't a strong correlation in the data, perhaps it's not a major factor here.\n\nShe has been arrested twice but hasn't been convicted. This seems like a moderate risk because a history of arrests often indicates higher likelihood of future interactions with the justice system. Maybe assign that a medium weight.\n\nHer height is 5'2\" and she weighs 160 lbs. Body size wasn't directly mentioned in the examples, but being average might not be a significant factor. I'll go with low here because it doesn't seem to contribute much to recidivism based on past data.\n\nShe's never been married and lives alone. Solitary living could increase stress or risk-taking behaviors, so that's probably a medium weight since having a stable environment can reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes.\n\nShe has a high school diploma and is enrolled in a 2-year college. Education level wasn't directly tied to recidivism in the examples, but higher education might indicate better decision-making skills. I'll assign this as low because it doesn't strongly predict criminal behavior.\n\nShe held two jobs last year. Employment can be stabilizing, so having steady work might reduce her chances of getting rearrested. That should be a medium weight since it suggests she has some structure in her life.\n\nShe used drugs (marijuana and cocaine) in the past four years. Drug use itself isn't necessarily predictive of future behavior unless there's evidence of addiction or other issues. However, recent drug use can increase recidivism, so I'll give this a medium weight.\n\nMost of the time over the past month, she felt down and hopeless. Depressed mood is a significant risk factor for criminal behavior because it can lead to substance abuse, impulsive actions, and poor decision-making. This seems like a high-weight factor because mental health issues strongly correlate with recidivism.\n\nShe lived with both biological parents in a household of size 4 in a rural area as a young child. Family structure wasn't directly addressed in the examples, but growing up in a stable family environment might reduce risks. So I'll assign this a low weight since it indicates she had some support growing up.\n\nLastly, she doesn't believe God has anything to do with her personal life. Religiosity isn't mentioned much in the past data, so maybe it's not a significant factor here. Assigning it a low weight seems appropriate because without clear evidence, it's hard to predict its impact on recidivism.\n\nPutting all these together: age (medium), criminal history (medium), employment (medium), drug use (medium), mental health (high), family background (low). The highest weight is mental health at high, which significantly increases the risk. So I'm leaning towards a \"YES\" prediction with a high confidence score because her current state of mind and recent behavior are strong indicators.\n</think>\n\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"medium\", \"young age may lead to impulsive decisions\"),\n    (\"race\", \"low\", \"no clear pattern in examples\"),\n    (\"criminal_history\", \"medium\", \"history of arrests indicates higher likelihood\"),\n    (\"body_size\", \"low\", \"not directly related to recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_situation\", \"medium\", \"solitary living may increase stress or risk-taking\"),\n    (\"education\", \"low\", \"higher education may improve decision-making\"),\n    (\"employment\", \"medium\", \"steady work indicates stability\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"medium\", \"recent use can increase recidivism risks\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"high\", \"depressed mood strongly linked to criminal behavior\"),\n    (\"family_background\", \"low\", \"stable upbringing may reduce risks\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"not clearly predictive in examples\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 85\n}",
