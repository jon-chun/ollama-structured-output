    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to predict whether this individual will be rearrested within the next three years based on the given factors. Let me go through each factor one by one and assess their importance.\n\nFirst, age is 20, which is a young adult. From the examples provided, it seems that younger individuals have higher rates of recidivism. So I'll give this a high weight because being under 21 might increase the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nNext, race is White. In the examples, White individuals had outcomes like \"NO\" and \"YES\". There's no clear trend based on just one case, so maybe medium weight since it doesn't strongly predict either outcome.\n\nHe has been arrested once but not convicted. From the data, being arrested without a conviction seems to lean towards lower recidivism. So I'll assign this a low weight because having an arrest record without a conviction might not be as significant as having a prior conviction.\n\nHis height is 5'9\" and weight is 155 lbs., which is average for someone his age. Physical build doesn't seem directly related to recidivism, so I'll give this a low weight since it's less likely to influence behavior significantly.\n\nHe's never been married and lives alone. Living alone might mean he has more access to substances or opportunities to commit crimes, so this could be medium weight as independence can sometimes correlate with higher risk behaviors.\n\nHaving a high school diploma is a positive factor. Education often reduces the likelihood of recidivism, so I'll assign this a low weight because education typically lowers crime rates.\n\nNot enrolled in college might mean he's more available for criminal activities, but again, it's not as strong a factor as things like prior convictions or substance use. So medium weight here since lack of further education could increase risk.\n\nHe held two jobs this year, which is positive. Employment usually reduces recidivism, so I'll give this a low weight because stable employment is protective against criminal behavior.\n\nHe used marijuana and cocaine in the past four years. Substance abuse is a strong predictor of recidivism, so this should be high weight as drug use significantly increases the likelihood of reoffending.\n\nHe hasn't felt depressed recently, which might indicate he's in a better mental state. Mental health issues can contribute to criminal behavior, but since he's not currently depressed, this could lower his risk. So low weight here.\n\nHe lived with both parents in a household of three. Family structure can influence behavior; having both parents might provide more supervision and support, reducing the likelihood of recidivism. So medium weight because family support can be protective.\n\nLastly, he believes God has control over his fate. Religiosity can reduce criminal behavior as it provides moral frameworks, so this is a positive factor. I'll give this a low weight since belief in a higher power often lowers crime rates.\n\nPutting all these together, the strongest predictors are substance use and being young. Substance use is high risk, and age is also high. The rest of the factors are medium or low. So overall, there's a moderate to high likelihood he'll be rearrested.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"age\", \"high\", \"Younger individuals have higher rates of recidivism\"),\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"White individuals had mixed outcomes in examples\"),\n    (\"arrest_record\", \"low\", \"Arrest without conviction may not predict recidivism strongly\"),\n    (\"physical_build\", \"low\", \"Physical build is unlikely to significantly influence behavior\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Living alone might increase access to substances or crime opportunities\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"low\", \"High school diploma reduces recidivism risk\"),\n    (\"college_enrollment\", \"medium\", \"Not enrolled may increase availability for criminal activities\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"low\", \"Held two jobs, which is protective\"),\n    (\"substance_use\", \"high\", \"Drug use is a strong predictor of recidivism\"),\n    (\"mental_health\", \"low\", \"Not feeling depressed might lower risk\"),\n    (\"family_structure\", \"medium\", \"Family support can reduce recidivism\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Belief in God reduces criminal behavior\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 70\n}\n```",
