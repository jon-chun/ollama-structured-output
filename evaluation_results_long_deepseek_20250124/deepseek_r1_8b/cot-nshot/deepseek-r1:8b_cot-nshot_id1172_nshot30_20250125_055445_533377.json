    "raw_message_text": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out whether this 19-year-old male who's been arrested once and convicted will be rearrested within the next three years. Let me go through each of his factors one by one and see how they stack up.\n\nFirst off, he's Black. From the examples provided, it seems like race might play a role in recidivism, but I'm not entirely sure if it's a major factor or just part of a larger trend. Maybe it's medium because being a minority can sometimes correlate with higher rates due to systemic issues.\n\nHe's been arrested once and convicted. A prior arrest is definitely a red flag. People who have been convicted before are more likely to reoffend, so this seems like a high risk factor. I'll go with high for this one.\n\nHis height is 5 feet 10 inches and he weighs 155 lbs. I'm not sure how physical characteristics tie into recidivism, but maybe being average in build doesn't significantly affect it. Maybe this is low because there's no clear indicator here.\n\nHe hasn't been married and is living alone. Single and independent living might mean he has more time and fewer responsibilities that keep him from getting into trouble, so maybe this is a medium risk factor.\n\nHe has a GED certificate but isn't enrolled in college. Having a high school diploma is usually positive because it indicates some education, which can reduce recidivism. But not being in college might mean he's not as motivated or structured, so this could be a bit of a mixed bag. Maybe medium.\n\nHe hasn't held any jobs this year. Unemployment can lead to higher rates of criminal behavior as people seek ways to cope. This seems like a significant risk factor, probably high.\n\nHe used marijuana in the past four years but hasn't felt depressed recently. Drug use is definitely a major factor for recidivism. Even if he's not currently depressed, the fact that he used drugs recently points towards higher likelihood. High here as well.\n\nHe lived in a household of size 4 when young. Households with multiple members might provide more support or supervision, but it's unclear how this directly affects adult behavior. Maybe low because it doesn't strongly indicate risk.\n\nLastly, he believes God has something to do with his situation. Religiosity can sometimes be protective against criminal behavior, so maybe this is a positive factor, making it low.\n\nPutting it all together, I see that factors like prior conviction, unemployment, and drug use are high risks. The others seem less impactful or even protective. So overall, the prediction leans towards \"YES\" for rearrest within three years.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"risk_factors\": [\n    (\"race\", \"medium\", \"Based on examples, race may influence recidivism due to systemic issues\"),\n    (\"prior_arrest_conviction\", \"high\", \"A prior arrest and conviction are strong indicators of future recidivism\"),\n    (\"physical_characteristics\", \"low\", \"Average build doesn't significantly impact recidivism\"),\n    (\"living_arrangement\", \"medium\", \"Single living may provide more time for trouble-seeking behavior\"),\n    (\"education_level\", \"medium\", \"GED indicates some education but lack of college may increase risk\"),\n    (\"employment_status\", \"high\", \"Unemployment can lead to criminal behavior as a coping mechanism\"),\n    (\"drug_use\", \"high\", \"Recent drug use is a significant risk factor\"),\n    (\"household_size\", \"low\", \"Household size as a child doesn't strongly predict adult behavior\"),\n    (\"religiosity\", \"low\", \"Religious beliefs may reduce recidivism, indicating lower risk\")\n  ],\n  \"prediction\": \"YES\",\n  \"confidence\": 75\n}\n```",
